the eyeless self howls, hunts, gropes and gnaws
he had shown freaks at fairs and owned a booth with a trumpet and this advertisement: babet, dental artist, member of the academies, conducts physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, tackles stumps abandoned by his colleagues

toward the end of october of that same year, number, the inhabitants of toulon saw the ship orion sail back into their port to have some damage repaired, following a bout of rough weather
this is what gives folard the right to contradict polybiusnumber we might add that there is always a certain moment when the battle degenerates into combat, individualizes itself, and dissolves into innumerable detailed events that, to borrow the phrase from napoléon himself, belong to the biography of the regiments rather than to the history of the army

when it comes to civilization, the thing is not to refine but to sublimate
she’s a young lady
what if you don’t repair the wheel and replace it instead?
whoever says love, says woman
you be an upright man, you keep on being monsieur le maire, keep on being honourable and honoured, play the hero, make the town rich, feed the poor, bring up orphans, live happily ever after, virtuous and admired, and during that time, while you’re here living in joy and in the light, someone else will have your red shirt on, someone else will bear your name in ignominy and drag your chain in jail!
all of a sudden, taking advantage of a moment when the newcomers were keenly questioning the little girl about her injured hand, he went over to the bed where his wife was, looking dopey and out of her depth, and he quickly whispered to her:
it’s a decaying carcass, for christ’s sake!
the grandfather did a pirouette on his ninety-year-old heels and began to speak again, like a spring springing back:
sometimes i take off at night
her hard face had shifted subtly to an expression of timidity and punctiliousness that was not normal for her
all other historians are dazzled and in their dazzled state they are left groping
alas, our work was incomplete, i admit; we demolished the structures of the ancien régime, but we didn’t quite manage to obliterate its ideas
the protest of right against crime goes on forever
have a little faith in me
so much the better
this is what had happened to marius
he had lost the capacity to work and to move firmly toward a determined goal, but he was even more clear-sighted and honourable than ever
in any case, what i can say is that, if he did have all these ideas, he didn’t let on for a moment, not even to me

when adversity came calling, he cordially greeted that old acquaintance; he was on very good terms with catastrophe; he was so familiar with the twist of fate that he called it by a nickname
chenildieu was brought in, a convict for life, as his red jersey and green cap indicated

monsieur le maire, i must deal with myself the way i’d deal with anyone else
he glimpsed things from strange angles; and, as he could not put them into perspective, he wasn’t sure whether he wasn’t looking at chaos
no one could tell

on that note, i insist on drinking
he used to say of them: they’re peasants, not bourgeois; that’s why they’re smart
they hit home cannily just where it was vulnerable; they attacked this particular revolution in its royalty
suddenly he gave a start
a man, replied combeferre, who saves others
restoring every exemplum to its banality as an image and as an ordinary object, elevating every banal image to the power of an example; duplicating an image so it avows its duplicity, turning it round to show its other side – these are the essential weapons of this manner of standing up to history

one day he stayed even longer than usual
the little thénardier boys became the little magnon boys
two armchairs had been placed on either side of the fireplace
this door was normally half-open in the most inviting way, revealing two things that had nothing especially gloomy about them—a courtyard surrounded by vine-covered walls and the face of a porter lounging there

so, i’m going away, my children
the man with the bell
the fall of everything, all around him, only accentuated grantaire’s annihilation; collapse rocked him like a cradle
at that moment a pair of black trousers clambered down from the top deck and appeared at the coach window

laziness, pleasure—what bottomless pits!

beginning of an enigma
this luminous pink foot emerging from the shadows suddenly struck azelma, who said to éponine: look, sister!
some years back, a stranger to that département, a man named monsieur madeleine, had revived an old local industry, the manufacture of jet and black glass beads, thanks to new processes
there’s some more riffraff for you, that lot!
at the very next visit of the archbishop, the prioress told the story to his grace, half by way of a confession, half by way of a boast
at a brisk trot all the way, and he’ll do it in under eight hours
as for him, he lived in the sort of porter’s lodge at the back of the yard, with a mattress on a bed of webbing, a pinewood table, two straw-bottomed chairs, an earthenware water pitcher, a few books on a board, his precious suitcase in a corner, never a fire

but i will have enjoyed myself
from that blessed and sacred moment when a kiss sealed the betrothal of these two souls, marius went there every evening
i am with you
pay for these poor people, give them the extra five francs and don’t say it’s from me
he accompanied napoléon to the island of elba
as he was in the depths of this reverie, his old servant basque came in and asked him:
it was the money they wanted
what’s wonderful, too, is the ease with which people spout hot air
the porter went no further than waking up basque
perils of another kind, no less great, were perhaps awaiting them
there were still no stars in the sky
it is hard to imagine all the perseverance and effort required to bring this cloaca to the point of relative perfection it has now attained
no doubt about it, the man was an enigma
i’ll be a lady
no one corrupts me
she was sad with an obscure sadness that baffled even the woman herself

i don’t know what i can do—
he reckoned he’d be at the tillac d’argent tonight

it’s not hard to understand
on the part of any traveller who had eaten a slice of lamb and drunk two bottles of wine at supper and who did not look like a frightful pauper, such a wish would have been a command
this cloistered existence, so austere and so mournful, a few features of which we have just outlined, is not life, for it is not liberty; it is not the grave, for it is not fullness; it is a strange place from which you see, as though you were on a high mountaintop, the abyss where we are on one side and, on the other, the abyss where we will be; it is a thin and hazy border dividing two worlds, at once illuminated and obscured by both, where the feeble light of life mingles with the dim light of death; it is the half-light of the grave
and since you showed no mercy in getting yourself killed like this, i won’t even feel any grief at your death, do you hear, you assassin!
if the provocation of denying the nazi extermination camps has resisted attack and is even gaining ground, this is because it is synchronous with this spirit of the times, a spirit of resentment, ressentiment: not just resentment of the ideals of the new man which people believed in, or resentment of the people who got you to believe in those ideals or the people who destroyed them and brought about the general loss of faith
no one loves daylight more than the blind

the fixed stare all the combatants had pinned on the end of the street turned savage
four walls washed with lime, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows, on the door a great wooden crucifix, above the crucifix a square window stuffed with a bale of hay, in a corner, on the ground, an old glazed windowframe all broken—that is the chapel for you
meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate

it would mean risking the lives of three or four poor gendarmes for no purpose
but the counsel for the prosecution needed a jean valjean and, not having champmathieu anymore, latched onto madeleine
mother saint mechthilde, in charge of singing and the choir, was only too happy to use the boarders
i know chateaubriand very well
the barber wheeled around with a look of fury on his face and, without letting go of his razor, shoved the elder boy back with his left hand and the little one with his knee, pushing them out into the street; then he shut his door in a huff: letting in the cold for nothing!
monsieur gillenormand had inherited it from a ferocious great-aunt on his mother’s side who was a hundred when she died
and with health, a kind of bitter harshness toward his grandfather returned
old gillenormand said to himself
all the women who are cooks in the croix-rougenumber turn to me
meanwhile gavroche, who had madly retraced his steps, stopped five or six streets away and sat down panting on the curbstone at the corner of the enfants rouges

she watched them, but with a calm and savage air
icicaille est le théâtre
he said to himself: there is perhaps a glimmer of life in there yet; i’m going to risk my own existence for that miserable spark!
the cuirassiers did not have time to pause for breath
he took another few steps and then stopped short: wake up to yourself!
toward one o’clock in the morning, the night being pitch black, he saw on the roof, in the rain and howling wind, two shadows flit past the dormer window opposite his cage
as night fell, marius was walking along the same path as the day before with the same rapturous thoughts in his heart, when he saw, through the trees on the boulevard, éponine coming toward him
a rapid dialogue broke out between him and the man with the cudgel, the skinny one
without counting all the heartaches
in his heyday, bonaparte had come across this in italy and defeated it superbly
in the twilight, marius could just make out their livid faces, their thin matted hair, their awful bonnets, their tattered skirts and bare feet

in a very short while you realized you saw nothing
i prefer the baby you gave me by far
monsieur gillenormand noticed that since he had been brought home to him and since he had regained consciousness, marius had not once called him father—though he did not show that he noticed this
no, he said, they’re after me, they would simply arrest me in her room and that would upset her
monsieur gillenormand, as cosette’s surrogate guardian, had stood in for him
my brother bought it in the days when he was in germany, at tottlingen, near the source of the danube, along with the little ivory-handled knife i use at table
and he placed on the table the packet that aunt gillenormand had mistaken for a book
he placed his hand on the doorknob, the spring bolt yielded, the door cracked open, jean valjean opened it just wide enough to squeeze through, remained motionless for a second, then shut the door again and turned back to face marius
would you have a cabriolet i could hire?
and after the bog, what about the police patrol?
now he’s satisfied, he’ll let me alone, he’s got his jean valjean!
how sad the soul when it is sad out of love!
a cloud passed over marius’s forehead
to whom was this addressed?
after chanting, bell ringing, chime ringing, the knells, the services, the noise of little girls would suddenly burst out, sweeter than the humming of bees

the author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, at about twenty miles from brussels, a slice of the middle ages within everyone’s reach, at the abbey of villers, the hole of the oubliettesnumber in the middle of the meadow that was the cloister courtyard, and, on the banks of the dyle, four solitary stone cells, half-underground, half-underwater

marius did not understand and made the mistake of falling for it
she would stumble across them in the street, she would stumble into them again on her stairs

a moment ago, when they told us to come over, i thought i was going to die again, but this time of joy
then you’ll only have me to deal with
but how excusable he finds them, even while standing up to them!
this pitiless century, the twentieth
it sounded like musket shots and the clamour of a big crowd
but you have time—where do you live?
a real hussar, all right!
you do more than that, you slander yourself while you’re pretending to unmask yourself

half a century ago, in ordinary everyday parlance, which is entirely made up of traditions and which persists in calling the institut, les quatre nations, and the opéra-comique, feydeau, the precise point jean valjean had come to was called the petit-picpus
meanwhile cosette remained immured in her apparent insouciance and her imperturbable tranquillity—so much so that jean valjean came to this conclusion: this noodle is madly in love with cosette, but cosette doesn’t even know he exists
what had happened in those ten months?
was he to continue to keep quiet?
i raised this child, you see
you’ll see that i’m worth your while

but the young man had taken less time to go down than the octogenarian to climb up, and when old man gillenormand stepped into the attic room, marius was no longer there
cherubino does better than rothschildnumber
bric-a-brac from attics and dustbins can take the place of the painter's colours in an abstract’ kind of painting that immediately becomes history painting – as radicalized genre painting

the wigmaker ran to the broken window and saw gavroche running away as fast as his legs would carry him toward the saint-jean market
marius had flown out of the barricade
to hang off mummy or daddy’s necknumber
what are you doing here, father madeleine?
jean valjean had left the garden wild so that it would not attract attention
marius, we must insist, was standing in the shadow of those great dark wings that flap open over any soul at death’s door
if you only knew, monsieur pontmercy, her beautiful rosy cheeks, they were my joy in life: whenever i saw her a bit pale, i was sad
babet added, sticking to the classic wisecracking slang poulailler and cartouchenumber used to speak, and which is to the bold, new, coloured, and risqué slang brujon used what the language of racine is to the language of andré chénier:number your barkeep must’ve been caught in the act on the stairs
he watched all the dressing operations, while mademoiselle gillenormand absented herself for modesty’s sake
it is the awakening of something radiant and new
here she broke off to wipe her glasses
the barricade has two saviours: marius pontmercy and you
champmathieu more and more amazed
her very babble was conversation
jean valjean pulled a knife out of his fob pocket and flicked it open
he found the key, opened the cupboard, and thrust his arm in without looking and without taking his startled eyes off the fragment of cloth thénardier held up
i the year number
a priest and a good man!
the supreme moment had arrived
this philosophy has been dragged from the depths and unearthed by specialists in the field
my romantic little goatee!
i’ll stay downstairs, answered jean valjean

find out for me
said the old gentleman, alarmed
monsieur can’t set off again before tomorrow
he lowered his voice further still: put this on the fire
he rose to his feet, hesitated a moment longer and listened; all was quiet in the house, so he headed straight for the window, which he could make out, taking small careful steps

it is the effect of a galloping carriage that suddenly comes to a halt
her eyes were red
nature had made her a mere sheep; religion had made her an angel
the young man looked him steadily in the eye and asked him: why’s that?
all the feelings and all the recollections you would imagine him to have had evaporated
the door opened again, the man reappeared; he was carrying in both hands the fabulous doll we mentioned and that the village kids had been ogling since morning, and he stood it before cosette, saying: here, this is for you

if marius had been courfeyrac, that is, one of those people who laugh at every occasion life throws up, he’d have burst out laughing when his eye lit on mother jondrette
the english barricaded themselves in there; the french got in but could not maintain their position
i don’t like it, but it makes you light in the head
the way marius behaved was no longer at all natural
these sorts of details, particularly in this day and age, might give the bishop of digne a certain pantheist profile, to use an expression currently in vogue, and promote the idea, either to his debit or his credit, that he had one of those personal philosophies peculiar to the age that sometimes take root in solitary souls and build and grow there until they replace religion
at intervals we see truth, that sunshine of the human soul, glimmering away there
cried the old man
marius went slightly red and replied: it means that i’m my father’s son

the young were in the process of shedding their skins, if you’ll forgive the expression
marius signalled the driver to stop and shouted at him: by the hour!
he thought he’d caught a few words once at the luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure
i couldn’t care less
do you stick those little iron things in the little rings to lock them properly?
how many times had he got back up covered in blood, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in his heart, serenity in his soul!
he eluded all eyes, from all sides, as we have just explained
little things that are enormous in the void
marius’s failing fingers had nearly let go of the pistol
the man who breaks out, we repeat, is a man inspired; there is starlight and lightning in the mysterious glow of flight; the straining after deliverance is no less amazing than the flapping after the sublime; and we say of a thief who got away: how did he manage to scale that roof?
jean valjean was in fact properly fitted out; he had the leather knee pad and the bell; he was now officially accepted
that lasted nine years and one month

he pushed the door

in those days, a moustache was the mark of a man about town and spurs signified a pedestrian
mademoiselle baptistine’s dress was cut along the lines of number models, with a short waist, narrow skirt, sleeves with padded shoulders, and with plackets and buttons

you recognized me without too much trouble, he muttered
his eyes were dead; the light had gone out
it would be a mistake to think you can walk around like this, on your own, in uninhabited areas of paris, without meeting with some adventure
he had a long life and a magnificent death!
the iron supports for the right wall are in the form of a cross
she lifted up the stone, which was sizeable
as a domestic group, they were admirable
she’s waiting for me there, he said
to wipe out abuse is not enough; you have to change people’s whole outlook
and, hugged tight in cosette’s arms, he cried: it’s you!
inspector javert, he said, you’ve got me

i believe it’s true and i feel it’s true
what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true
with the same sack on the back, the same cord around the waist
yet he seemed determined not to ask directions from any passersby

like all great artists, thénardier was not satisfied
the morning of that very day, being the only one up and about in the house and taking a stroll in the garden before cosette’s shutters opened, he had suddenly spotted this line carved into the wall, probably with a nail: number, rue de la verrerie
(that’s how i am; i do my job; the rest is not my affair)

put yourself in my place, that’s all i have left
jean valjean had been in direr straits than this
it was clear that the man had let himself in with a key, as though he were at home there
the four planks of the coffin gave off a kind of terrible peace
it seemed to him to be taking either a century or only a second
it was, for him, like the first step of a flight of stairs leading back up to life
i took it off the monkeys
the colonel had been struck down by brain fever three days before

this box had a grille, too, only it was not a grille of gilded wood as at the opéra, it was a monstrous trellis of iron bars hideously enmeshed and fixed to the wall with enormous bolts that looked like clenched fists

he overwhelmed the weak point with grapeshot; he set battles up and dissolved them with cannons
monsieur le duc d’havré,number as captain of the guards on duty that day, was sitting in the carriage opposite the king

jean valjean, unshakable, never set foot in the garden

it does not need to insist on the present
that was the old paris for you, given up to carping, dithering, and groping around in the dark

i the charybdis of the faubourg saint-antoine and the scyllanumber of the faubourg du temple
the room on the upper floor, where the restaurant was, was a great long well crammed with stools, stepladders, chairs, benches, and tables and with a rickety old billiard table
how would i know?

the july revolutionnumber ushered in a crisis in the book trade
you know blondeau, he’s the one with the very pointy, very spiteful nose who loves sniffing out absentees
monsieur gillenormand could not go on; his own sentence stuck in his throat, and not being able to either finish it or retract it, while his daughter fluffed up marius’s pillow behind him, overcome by such surges of emotion, the old man hurled himself out of the bedroom, as fast as his age would allow him, slammed the door shut behind him and, purple in the face, choking, foaming at the mouth, his eyes popping out of his head, found himself nose to nose with the honest basque, who was polishing boots in the antechamber

he lived in vernon, where i have a brother who is a curé, and his name was something like pontmarie or montpercy
he struck a light using flint and steel and lit a candle; all these things had been set up in advance on the table, and he began to study cosette, as he had done the night before, with a gaze full of ecstasy in which goodness and tenderness combined almost to the point of distraction

after his fall, what happened at montreuil-sur-mer was the usual self-interested divvying up of what is left when great men fall, that fatal carving up of flourishing enterprises that takes place, out of sight, daily, in the human community and that history has noted only once because it happened to occur after the death of alexander the great
