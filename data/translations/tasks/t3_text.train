but when later she heard that xifeng was sending her to work for baoyu, she was more eager for this than baoyu himself

baoyu at once informed the lady dowager, and a doctor was sent to examine her
being in her cups, she pointed at the wall separating the two brothers’ houses and loosed off a flood of abuse
as they were crying out in consternation, miaoyu's attendants arrived in search of her
if that's the case, there's something i would like to tell you; but if she has not decided yet i dare not speak out of turn
after dabbling for a while he asked for a towel
pinger and the two others proceeded then to the lady dowager's apartments where all the girls from the graden were assembled

xifeng was strolling along enjoying this sight when a man appeared without warning from behind an artificial rockery and accosted her with, greetings, sister-in-law!

first thing tomorrow i shall proceed to my post, respectfully accept the seal of office, and then straightway give you fifty silver taels to spread over for several months for your club’s refreshments
the others exclaimed in delight after each line

guests staying here ca not manage with one servant only to cook and shop, remarked the abbot woodenly

he turned to bow to her saying, do not worry, sister-in-law
what an ado there would be if you had another bad relapse like that time when you lost your jade!
who would have thought this house would put up with them?

and she hasn’t eaten anything all day
he’s set his mind on inviting you to a feast
you can assign anyone you think fit to stay here so as to keep an eye on it

she asked the two women what new stories they had
tang san agreed to this
xiren’s only comment was, you were rather too hasty
lady wang ordered a feast of welcome at which jia zheng's sons and grandsons poured him wine; and though xifeng was the wife of a nephew, since she was running the household she joined baochai and the others in passing the wine
feeling reassured, baoyu went to the door and asked:

chiung−chih said nothing, but alighted and walked straight into the hall, where she sat herself down
the colour of flowers?
the next day it was after noon before jia lian arrived
this year is not propitious, said fan chin
and the next day when the lady dowager asked why her eyes were so red and swollen
when at last the feast ended and they prepared to leave, they suddenly discovered that xiangyun was missing
each time they come they reel all this off, as if offering the old lady some rare treasure
but he still insisted on having the money
what is there to say?
that's where you were wrong!
your best bet is to go to the big mansion
in swaying dance, now swift, now slow
i am sure you will pass high on the list this year, said mr chi, when he came to see him off
just then a serving-woman hurried in
they’re quite different when you compare them

but i’ve been so engrossed in talking, a long time’s slipped by and i must be getting back now

she turned back and went in again at once
i hope you will forgive me, sir, for being so remiss
how dare you stall, you little bastard!
if he goes to the examination hall, we will be the spirits of those he has wronged!
looking downwards, they saw a crystal stream cascading as white as snow and stone steps going down through the mist to a pool
as they were feasting, a servant came in with a note writen on fine sungchiang paper folded in the manner of an invitation card
her ladyship's waiting for you
let's go back and have a look
ouguan had the fantastic notion that as she used to play young men and diguan young ladies, and as they were often cast as husband and wife, although it was make-believe they should act the part every day as if they were really in love
he carried her to the kang, where he showered kisses on her and fumbled with her clothes, pouring out incoherent endearments
i asked for you in the seal shop, and learned that you had moved here
i am he, replied wang mien, and this is my humble house

only a little fruit, what does it matter?
or go and rave if you must to those petty-minded creatures who are so quick to take offence, and who know how to manage you

he didn’t think you would be back so soon
and therefore instead of entering she turned away, wiping her tears
as this development looked serious and caiping feared she would be held to blame, she quietly went and reported it to madam you
seeing the tear-stains on her face he asked, who’s been offending you again, cousin?
my father knew nothing about it
he looked round but could see no writing-brush or ink, and for fear of being disturbed he read rapidly on

miss xichun is at home, longing to see you

nursing her grief, the old lady rose to leave the palace and go home by sedan-chair

good riddance to bad rubbish!
vast number pang palace,
at once baoyu went to tell the lady dowager, who instructed some trustworthy men to accompany him
i’ve never asked you to amuse me either
wait till we have set up the club before laying down rules, said li wan
then she reflected that, good as baoyu was to her, there was still a certain distance between them
to know whether it boded well or not, read the next chapter

countered baoyu as soon as he saw who it was
if i were so fond of silver, i should not have declined it as i did
''i do not suppose they are much good, they are just made to order
never mind that, put in chi wei−hsiao
we must have some sort of order

madam you made lady xing, lady wang and her mother take the places of honour, while she sat at a side table with xifeng and baoyu
he turned with a smile to ask her:
as xichun knew her ways, instead of pressing her to stay she saw her to the door

they filled the streets, and some of them sat on the ground to beg
i can’t toast myself here all the time,  replied qingwen smiling
at that the whole company laughed
i’m such a fool, i was so carried away by their arrival, i never thought of that
when he's in a saving mood he treasures the least scrap of thread, but at other times he does not mind squandering millions

by this time, moreover, brigade general miao had died in gaol, and the announcement of wan's appointment to the patent office had arrived
in that case we certainly won’t give him a wife
well, if they won’t join in, why don’t the two of us write a poem together?
because jia zhen was out —though he could have done nothing even if at home — jiao da was fairly letting himself go
i paid no attention, of course
your mother was lord she’s concubine, tanchun’s mother lord zheng’s concubine, and by rights you two should have the same status
i do not feel like it because my present rooms are not as light as those in the garden
this silenced xifeng and she giggled
as even she shows you special consideration, i shall have to explain this to you
when i tell him the real facts, he refuses to believe me
i’m certainly out of luck today,  madam you laughed, finding so many of you girls in a bad temper

then up came an irate matron to drag her away
smiling all over his face, he drew closer to whisper:
she just dropped in for a chat
asking a steward named yen from the yang family to accompany him, he went once more to the capital
you have lost several days over this case, said dr yu
this gentleman often comes to our house, he said, so there’s no need for all the maids to hide
how dare you confer the title of mistress on her
after they had paid their respects to the duke and greeted the other guests, everyone sat down to talk
baochai who had heard all this did not say a word, although inwardly she was lamenting
so when they met they could only express their concern in the most superficial way
soon she was out of sight
thus i despaired, my face with sad tears marred,
that would simply set tongues wagging
yingchun’s subject, the abacus, is in constant commotion; tanchun’s kite is something which drifts away with the wind; xichun’s temple lamp is even more lonely and neglected

baoyu was so absorbed by his thoughts that when daiyu flicked his eyes with her handkerchief, he gave a sudden start
a big fellow like him calling a boy like you father — isn’t that shameless?
she’s one of those who keep watch at night at the south gate of the garden,  mrs lin answered
what a dreadful thing -- all those monsters in the garden!

what more is there to say?
having cursed them roundly he told the chief steward lai da, bring me the roster of servants and check their names; then write an announcement for them all to read

then she inquired why baoyu had not come to greet her
that he was flustered made him blunder along more awkwardly than ever, without looking where he was going

he then left to tell the servants to make preparations
though it cannot speak
and now qinger told zhang hua, as you were engaged to the girl first, if you demand her the court will have to give her to you
baochai ignored him, secretly telling xiren to give him a sedative and talk him round little by little
the zhens are different from other families,  observed the lady dowager
don’t mix them up!
the lady dowager chuckled
madam you asked lady xing and lady wang, would you prefer to eat here or in the garden?
so she was so lovely and chaste,  he reflected, torn by remorse
i have thought of another
she received this message with a smile and the comment:
this path will take you there
she searched the whole room, but there was no trace of it
her tutor was paid as highly as if he were teaching a boy, and he supervised her studies just as strictly
sixth master sat down on a bench, pulling both girls with him — one on each side
it to requite debts of breeze and moonlight
so i knew that though qingwen’s gone her name would still be on your lips
as their host could not prevail on him to stay, baoyu had no choice but to go back with him
she told a maid to burn incense and sat quietly for a while, then looked up the treatises on draughts by kong rong,number wang jixin and others
you are his favourite; see if you ca not talk him round
did you ask where he lives?
asked tanchun with a smile
weeping and choking, her face streaked with tears and sweat, she looked most fearfully frail
when baoyu entered the lady dowager’s room, he was relieved to find her playing cards there with his mother as if nothing were amiss
in the next year or two i expect to pass the palace examination, and after that, of course, i will need a lot of money; so for the time being i must hold on to what i have
but why should that be?
passing through the gate, baoyu observed that all the maids and matrons in the court were beaming
so unseasonable blossom must be an evil omen
li wan and tanchun rose early to attend her until she left, then went back to the hail
well, take that couplet in the poem on the northern borderland:
in gauze cap and official gown, he was wearing flowers and had red silk over his shoulders
what's all this crying during the festival?
as it will soon be growing dark, he told us to come home first
jia qin picked it up and read it
i was fortunate, said mei chiu
then having given the monk five cents for incense, he made his servant carry all the left−overs back to the city
overjoyed, he immediately heated six or seven pots more, obtaining from them six or seven more ingots
she was rather vexed herself too because the game was so dull
xifeng, before she even started to speak, gesticulated with both hands and doubled up with laughter
the next day i called at the yamen, and although his honour had just returned from the county school and had a great deal of business to attend to, he immediately set it all aside and invited me in
let's wait a little, answered yu with a smile
after zhang cai’s wife had finished her business and returned the tally, the other was sent with it to get wall-paper
she was wondering whether or not to go back when the sound of talk and laughter inside -- she distinguished the voices of baoyu and baochai -- upset her even more
lady wang told xifeng to take all the gifts to the old lady for her inspection, and to get xiren to let baoyu know as well
just look at this household!
we’ve more important things to see to
distraught by this news siqi thought,  even if there’s a scandal we ought to die together
put in baochai quickly
jia zhen now disposed of this rent in kind as follows: part was kept for the ancestral sacrifice; part delivered by jia rong to the other mansion; part kept for family use; and the rest divided into different shares and placed on the terrace of the main hail, where the younger men of the clan were summoned to collect them
he begged on his knees
what really matters, the messenger can tell you
four smart attendants in silk and brocade, each wearing new shoes, served tea punctiliously; and when their master bade them prepare a meal, they assented together before they left the room
at this there was general laughter
she was meaning to visit the girls when xichun sent a maid to invite her over
at this point xifeng came in and paid her respects to both her seniors in turn
is there anyone in the county who does not know him?
are you dressed like a gentleman of means with a responsible post?
just work it out for yourself!
she then turned to jia rong and said, take uncle bao to rejoin the others while i stay here a little longer
this sounded to baoyu like a reflection on him
no, that won’t do
this is not a regular sacrifice, she said
what a thing to say!
we can always come and ask for more when it's finished
pity this child of a wealthy noble house
you do not take medicine at random like that
xifeng tossed it off
you should be pleased by his appointment instead of worrying like this
four or five days later kuang ta came home early, bringing a pot of wine and a chicken which he ordered his wife to boil to welcome his brother home
cousin xifeng really is growing rather thoughtless
whatever he's like, he's your brother-in-law, she said
if she doesn’t know any better, you should have told her
an old man like you need not stand upon ceremony, they said
and now baoyu walked over to make her a deep bow
after more curses he swaggered to his sedan−chair, followed by the servants and luggage
all we’ve heard is that my brother has been arrested by the county yamen for killing a man outside
when they had reached chao's house and sat down in the hall, feng asked chao to unfasten the chains on wan's neck
xiaoyan and sier, who had been awaiting this order, immediately called for the gate to be unlocked and went off to the different apartments
just then someone in the yard started bellowing, i have always said those nuns, bawds, go-betweens and the like are no good!
does not he want the money then?
let me send to aunt xue for some, proposed lady wang
we have so many people here, if we don’t make an example of one of them the bigger offenders will get quite out of hand
she went dejectedly back to her room and lay down to think it oven
people said he had no manners and should know better; but later didn’t he tell us in confidence, you know, sisters, it’s not that i had no sense of respect, but those monks are so dirty i was afraid you’d find their stench overpowering
it was thoughtful of you to send over to ask how she was the other day
the two of them went together then to the lady dowager’s quarters
why stir up more trouble?
still, it's natural, you know, for her to see things rather differently
from it alighted an old man in a square cap, white gauze gown and red silk slippers, who had the red nose of a heavy drinker, and a long, silky, silvery beard
i forgot just now to suggest that you should make up some riddles in his presence
i heard some talk of that, put in chih, but never knew the details
xiren and the others told him to go out to meet them and pay his respects, for though deranged he could still get about as usual
ducks in red rue studio foretells the future
ni is looking for his sixth brother
as she tossed and turned someone called softly through the window:
this done, he took a seat in the temple annex and called jia zhen and jia lian in to ask about family affairs
in all the different young masters’ and mistresses’ households, which nurse or nanny doesn’t get certain perks
after the death of the duke of rongguo, his elder son jia daishan succeeded to the title and married a daughter of marquis shi of jinling, by whom he had two sons, jia she and jia zheng
her chance came at noon one day when aunt xue, baochai and daiyu were eating water-melons in lady wang's apartments
instead she told fenger who was standing near by to take word of this at once to their lady ships
if there would been a scandal, not only would he be dismissed -- our ancestors might even be deprived of their titles!
you have thought it all out!
she seems to fit this description of qingwen,
two rugs were spread at the foot of the slope under the fragrant osmanthus trees for the serving-women and the younger maids, who were urged to eat and drink as much as they liked and not to come unless called
how can men commit a murder and go scot-free?
i was just going to tell you something, said the old lady
though she did not say so outright, her attitude was so clear that her parents could not accept the offer for her
would you like to meet him?
baoyu pressed them to stay, but mrs lin had already led her party off to finish making their rounds
my mother has been dead now for more than three years
so many inlaws and nurses chipping in for your birthday, yet you’re still not satisfied
he asked pointing inside
the old lady nodded
and if this experiment fails, we can think of something else
yinger hastily reported this to her mother
he examined it and it was certainly solid
i was serving at the bar
presently jia zheng returned, as he still had misgivings about the old lady
so saying, she too stepped forward without thinking and reached out her hand to wipe his perspiring face
braving the cold it blossoms for the east wind
if it’s an immortal’s gate, that won’t be easy to enter!
well,  whispered pinger
squat down there until we come back and don’t make a sound
thinking it wisest to make herself scarce, she told hupo:
so that’s who he is!
we came to congratulate the old gentleman on his birthday, remarked lady xing and lady wang
he diagnosed baoyu’s upset as a slight one, a mild case of indigestion and a chill which sweating would put right
then a lucky day was chosen for the new tutor to take up his duties
if you think it good, you must drink another cup, madam
a few days ago a son was born to mr hu, explained the abbess
well, she lives in bamboo lodge and she's always crying
i have long heard of your fame
baoyu had skipped through these, noting here and there a well-written paragraph or argument or certain digressions, amusing anecdotes or poignant sentiments
it goes without saying they’ll appear rather delicate
i shall report this to the mistresses, so look out for a thrashing!
true understanding need not be sought far away
when did he pass away?
as these messengers left baochai exclaimed joyfully, can it be our xue ke and his sister?
the medicine was brought and decocted, and xiren drank it
yet silver and gold they prize
mrs zhou demurred, the other day she scolded wang shanbao’s wife and boxed her ears for being too officious
when they looked at my arm, it was not even bruised
so you’d better not go in
very well then, he said to baoyu, smiling
all you understand is eating, drinking and whoring
when jia zhen and all the young men had dined, the party broke up; and there is no need to describe the entertainment they offered all their kinsmen the next day
no, when the first emperor ascended the throne, he merely relied on the geomancers to choose an auspicious burial ground for his line
huan answered, the tutor has some business today, so he’s given us one day’s holiday
i gave my age as thirty
however, two doses of medicine failed to cure her - she raved more wildly than ever
one of them replied, i have long known of your brother lord she's unseemly conduct, and master zhen of that mansion was even more profligate
whispered zijuan, her tears falling like rain
i need money right away
when she was five or six he had engaged a tutor to teach her the four books and the five classics,  so that by the time she was twelve she could expound the classics and read essays, having thoroughly mastered the works of wang shou−hsi
i’m just feeling slightly better; i don’t want to lose my temper
because even if someone promised to take a message, he might not deliver it
why are you sighing?
this reference to cakes is a classical allusion
of course he was delighted to be sent for
he steeped a bowl of rice in hot tea, added some diced pheasant and hastily swallowed this down
after he had collected the other passengers' fares they set out, and soon the boat reached swallow cliff
some pages were going to fetch them when huan stepped forward and caught hold of his father's gown, then fell on his knees
would she make up something against you?
thanks to the generosity of your masters above as well as your parents below, you were able to study like a young gentleman, cossetted by maids and nurses as if you were a phoenix
think i was freezing to death here?
let those carts in at once!
yellow in the face with a red beard, dressed in green
pointing at two dishes in a hamper yuanyang remarked:
whenever this geomancer found a site, the others who checked on it would prove it was no good
in the absence of news of miaoyu he kept brooding
swaying a little, baoyu called over his shoulder, she has a better time of it than our old lady
what are the symponis of this illness of yours, miss?
i am an ignorant villager, said wang mien, and did not recognize your highness
he's often used them
limp and out of breath, his heart misgave him
after sprinting a dozen miles without taking breath, he put the old man down
in regulated verse’ it’s just a matter of opening, developing, changing and concluding; and the developing and changing couplets in the middle should be antithetical
oh well, each one's romance is fated by heaven
the tender youth had never seen bastinadoes before; so, frightened out of his wits, he said whatever the magistrate wanted to hear, not daring to contradict him
i am keeping watch over this fairy plant, and no mortals are allowed to loiter here
did you hear of the death of concubine zhao whom you met here?
i have never fed anyone
his learning is profound
the others commented with a smile, this is really in a tragic vein
you won’t like what i’m going to say, but your father isn’t strict enough with you, and the old lady always shields you
the illusory land of great void is the blessed land of truth
once you get into that habit you’ll never cure yourself of it
that's why i came
it isn’t all that important
and melilotus leaves i took to stem
when people called her 'concubine' she swore at them and insisted on being called  amadam
but because he was too honest, sir, nobody liked him and he offended some people
xue pan, hearing this, gradually got over his rage
try to remember, or just go and ask them
you have to wait for the snow to melt in spring and run down the mountain before men and beasts can find water
and we don’t know yet how to raise two hundred to redeem it
what i told you that day was what i heard from hongyu
after an exchange of amenities lady wang sent to invite zhen baoyu in too, having heard that he was the image of he~ baoyu
your cousin daiyu, on the other hand, was narrow-minded and hyper-sensitive; that's why she did not live long
xiaohong, in fact, had been quite taken in
now, fourth brother, said chin when they rose from the table, you must show us what you can do
then you haven’t heard of the beating lord she gave master lian?
is it serious, nanny?
then he added, what a pity you’ve dirtied your new clothes too
you won’t catch cold, and sitting quietly by yourself you won’t be distracted either
having greeted xifeng in her usual teasing fashion, madam you led baoyu to a seat in the drawing room
the two sisters put down their sewing at this to chase him playfully and pummel him
the next day he packed up and crossed the yangtse
what do you think?
and as she took a seat, tanchun and baoqin got up and asked to be excused
yuanyang saw that this was done, then asked the matrons whether the boxes of titbits to go with the wine were ready yet or not
hurry up and plead with her!
we would know it, but that's no proof in a court of law
you can kill him or slice him to pieces just as you please!
back in his own room he stripped off his clothes and washed
his host saw him out
he felt even more touched
wouldn’t that be the smart thing to do?
and there are two more jars of lichees which miss baochai wants sent to master bao
just let it be
she could be seen in the distance wearing a big cape with a grey squirrel-fur hood, seated in a small bamboo sedan-chair sheltered by a black silk umbrella, and surrounded by her maids, each holding an umbrella
then the auspicious hour arrived and they went in two sedan−chairs, preceded by lanterns, to the bride's home
you may think eggs are easily come by, knowing nothing about conditions outside in the market
they exclaimed in surprise
his father and mother sat facing each other on the kang talking, while on a row of chairs below sat yingchun, tanchun, xichun and jia huan, all of whom except yingchun rose to their feet at his entrance
to tell the truth, i’m clumsy
its back door overlooked the river
unless a man could write paku essays, he was not considered a scholar
then xifeng called for clean bowls and chose dishes for baoyu
jia rong agreed at once to pass on this message
what does it matter?
if you fell into his clutches then, that would be worse
it’s not me they’re thinking of,  laughed his father
a thousand woodland birds begin to stir,
if there would been just one worth keeping, i would have someone to help me now
before long the doctor arrived and felt her pulses
i heard you were ill,  said mrs lin
seeing fangguan blowing on the soup, she hurried in
why are you so angry?
we had better go back to yicheng and prepare for a long journey
jia rong, being young and not involved, is to be released
xifeng took the jade from the old lady and went in with xiren to show it to baoyu, who had just woken from a nap
he was the one wearing the jade, so he’s the one you should ask instead of me
scholars should base their careers on success in the examinations
when did you get here, mother?
i am only afraid after he's joined the government and become chief examiner, he will miss genuine talent when he marks the candidates' papers
on it was inscribed in large characters happy land of
i am afraid my relatives may object, said mr
that would never do
but it's true, put in lady wang
their family may be transferred to the capital
but this small room is even better furnished than that big one, with all these fine things -- whatever they are called -- in it
i can use my own discretion in other matters, she replied, but i can’t obey you in this
when he had prostrated himself and burnt a magic formula to invoke the oracle, he asked wang hui and hsun mei to support the brush
those two are all right,  rejoined sheyue
xue ke gave a start
yes, said yen ta−yu
yet now she will wear furs and be a fine lady
as the maids had gone to fetch tea and there was no one else present, jia lian kept darting smiling glances at second sister, who lowered her head to hide a smile but did not respond, and he dared not make any further advances
xifeng smiled at this blunt way of talking
then she urged second sister to put on her jewels and they went out hand in hand to mount the carriage, in which they sat side by side
zhen to share out her belongings
asked the lady dowager anxiously
the old woman was hard of hearing
then along came brother liu in the nick of time to drive the brigands away, rescue our goods and save our lives into the bargain
so if i were you i’d appeal to madam lian
then in her concern she burned out and made lai wang's wife summon all the serving-women to assign them different tasks
baoyu, by nature restless, hankered after a stroll in the garden
pieh and feng were so terrified that their feet seemed nailed to the ground
buy a few cakes first, and i will tell you when i have eaten
but there is a masculine beauty too, which is seldom recognized
on the evening of the third day an oil lamp was lit on his table, and the room was crowded with relatives
so you can see all that happens to us is predestined, and it's no use worrying
going in sheepishly, he fell on his knees before the lady dowager
so your mistress is allowed to cheat, but i’m not allowed to bribe you,  teased madam you
to revert now to baoyu
yes, after all, it’s the old who are the most experienced,  observed xifeng
everyone praises your aunt xifeng,  he said, but to my mind she can’t stand comparison with your second aunt
it’s easy for you to jabber away on the kang, gouer retorted
i am only a slave, though, so what can i say?
don’t be afraid; i’ll protect you,  he promised her
let’s all fish to try our luck, proposed baoyu
you mustn’t spend any more on me,  protested granny liu
bailiff wu of the manor in black mountain village has arrived, sir,  he reported
aren’t you afraid of catching cold?
baochai drew her fan from her sleeve and ran after them over the grass
he’s come here several times to ask for it back, and when he fails to get it he points at me and scolds, don’t put on those ladified airs with me!
since all your maids’ things are here, there’s no need to search,  replied xifeng with a smile
as soon as he saw the memorial he asked what official post ha jing had held, and the board of ceremony reported that he had been a palace graduate, whose ancestor’s noble title had passed on to his son jia zhen
once they knew they had been tricked, they darted wildly out
i want to go to take the prefectural examination
so for a fortnight daiyu ate daily less, till her appetite had so diminished that she could not even swallow a mouthful of congee
fangguan’s too fussy,  said qingwen
li wan was on the point of explaining, but madam you stopped her
she, however, now went to madam you’s sitting-room, the floor of which was covered with a red carpet where stood a large gilded cloisonne brazier, its three legs in the form of elephant trunks
i hear you are from the yangtse valley, sir, said hsiao
lai wang’s wife relies on her mistress’ power
just then xifeng came in to pay her respects, and lady wang wanted a detailed account of the party---the other guests, the operas and the feast
what are you afraid of?
i longed to travel far, yet with no bourn,
i have long hoped to meet you, said yang
then tanchun and the others went back
then i will send her horoscope over, you get someone to choose an auspicious day, and the thing will be done
then came a large sedan-chair in which was seated an official in a black gauze cap and red robe
as she was speaking jia rong’s wife, having finished her toilet, came in to pay her respects
and since chen was another man who prized one copper as highly as his life, the two of them hit it off well together
i do not think the subject and rhymes should be decided by one per-son, yingchun demurred
why deny it when we have proof?
i consider our families well matched and think this should be a good marriage for tanchun
whenever magistrates and prefects pass by, they go in to pay their respects
i have come to say goodbye to her
baoyu knelt down and first asked after their ladyships’ health, then inquired after jia lian’s health
the young man, who was tired, entered a roadside inn to rest
there were such famous beauties as wang qiang, xi shi, fan su, xiaoman and jiang xian
tomorrow you can ask him
so why have these people come?
liu xiangiian’s eyes flashed with anger
how can you abuse her like this?
the days were so long that after lunch masters and servants alike were exhausted
keqing led the party to an inner room, where baoyu noticed a fine painting of the scholar working by torchlightnumber without even seeing who the artist was, he took a dislike to the picture
butcher hu was coming to offer his congratulations
countered yingchun with a smile
afterwards they sipped tea and chatted or amused themselves as they pleased
what has that letter got to do with you?
yet he was annoyed with me because of this and since then has cold-shouldered me
do you have a fever?
in fact, i think this hall is too big and would prefer to have a single feast in your library; so that the four of us can talk comfortably at the same table
whatever is the fellow driving at in this essay?
seeing that they were determined and not to be dissuaded, she could not help feeling a pang of pity and sent for gifts for them as well as for the abbesses
she has no parents, poor thing, no one to care for her
this will prevent any scandals here and save us money too
he called for zixiao
this academic discussion has a bearing on our business,  replied baochai
and nothing is left behind
this was the rong mansion
even li bai copied from yellow crane pavilion ~ when he wrote his phoenix tower
meanwhile refreshments had been served
you know that monster always talks nonsense, she said
the double ninth festiyal is near
then baoyu tried again
since they robbed us yesterday they must have taken the opposite direction
the rest were loud in their praise and jia zheng nodded
go in, uncle wang, and announce that the third mr tsang is here, he said
we come from the same district as your master, said the brothers
mrs zhou walked into the adjoining room and found xichun laughing and chatting with zhineng, a young nun from the water moon convent
he simply lay down quietly on his bed, leaving the three girls to chat in the outer room
she sent off your bad luck for you
because of you i got kicked and beaten
then, borrowing a small boat from a neighbour, the old man had all his purchases put aboard and rowed to where yang chih−chung lived
they were chatting together when a young maid came in and whispered to hupo
so whom is your honour going to arrest?
at first, they dared not venture out at night, so that birds and beasts ran wild; then, even in the daytime, they would only go there in groups and armed with weapons
who can we get to help us out?
after they had agreed to do this, he went to enlist the help of other colleagues
i can’t go on shamming illness indefinitely
quite a coincidence that, they commented, these two cases one after the other
having no interest in other provinces, he was eager to find his native place and soon discovered one cabinet labelled first register of twelve beauties of jinling
they looked at each other’s poem
she asked, more puzzled than ever
do not worry, sir, li rejoined
if she does it again we’ll punish her for both
commissioner zhao rose to his feet
we’ve consulted oracles too, and they all say we shall find it in a pawnshop
its bright splendour lights up the painted balustrade
speechless, they could only sob
she’s the only one here fit to be compared to a hibiscus
the lady dowager prays to heaven
colleagues must stand by each other
this is something auspicious and good; there’s no monster here
when i came in and looked for zhou rui's wife she was nowhere to be found, and a little girl told me she would been driven out for doing something wrong
lord zheng, you must wait prudently for a further decree
after paying their respects they returned home, instructed their cook to prepare a feast for the next day, and sent an invitation to the compiler saying that they wished to celebrate his home−coming
we’re too hard up to gad about
thus jia lian, going home that evening, found the place uncannily quiet
whatever sum’s given, who would dare to complain?
baoyu first drank half the cup, as no one was watching, then passed the rest to fangguan, who drained the cup
three years ago when i thought about this question too, she was my first choice
very good, was li gui’s answer
if i do, you must not let her know
she took it for granted that her husband had completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan and palace examinations; yet, even after they had been married for nearly two weeks, he still paid not the slightest attention to the essays which filled her room
it’s no use play-acting
lady wang who had taken to the boy answered readily, i would like to act as go-between myself
but i haven’t dirtied the bed
as soon as you get up your headache will stop!
it's kind of you to put up with it and let her have her own way
the old man swore
this took the wind out of her sails
caiyun explained, this seems to be all we have
please take your seats at table, gentlemen, he said
but if we wait till these are no longer problems, baoyu’s father will be gone, and what shall we do if his illness gets steadily worse?
later your father came to dine with us
but we’ve plenty of troublesome business here, and now that her ladyship’s growing old she sometimes forgets things
either but if you are afraid you will be lowering yourself, i wo not presume to lend it
i will say goodbye to you, uncle, and go back to my boat
baoyu caught hold of her hand then and asked softly:
he's sure to come back this way
one day she had just gone in when she heard an old woman at purple caltrop isle raising a rumpus
now fangguan came in with a small glass bottle about five inches high
aunt xue murmured agreement, then added, i wonder if you’re not, perhaps, rather partial to the wife for your younger son, madam?
with his catapult at his belt and his sword in his hand, hsiao charged fearlessly at the head of his men, cutting down all the tribesmen in his path
he then followed the matrons out again
yuanyang felt no fear but wondered, who is she?
when yang heard how they spoke, he felt even greater admiration for them and exchanged some courtesies with chu hsien−fu
there was nothing ostentatious about her costume, which was none too new
~granny, she said with an effort
yes, mother, said wang mien
this has been so from time immemorial
how can you carry on in this crazy way?
what i do is none of your business
gentle and demure, she looked very approachable
will you do some copying too?
still, since we belong to the same village, i wo not say any more
she knew lady wang must be referring to him
baoqin cut in gleefully:
in future she's to have the same treatment as concubine zhao, only her share is to come from my allowance, not from the general fund
gradually all the other guests left too, only kuo tieh−pi and lai the taoist priest staying behind to spend the night in chu−ko's room
if i am hurt i wo not blame you but mr chin
now is the time too use them
of course they can
who do you think you are, ting yen−chih?
as xiangyun said this she unwrapped her handkerchief from which she took a ring and passed it to xiren, who was loud in her thanks
these last few months i have saved a dozen strings of cash
your patron, mr tang, was a pupil of my grandfather; so i feel very close to you
how can you compare with her?
my brother-in-law lin ruhai, who was salt commissioner of yangzhou then, engaged him as a tutor for his daughter
i shall resign in a couple of days and leave here
on my return from court i happened to be passing this way, so i decided to call on your father, little thinking that he was already no more
but fan chin brushed past them into the house to look at the official announcement, already hung up, which read: this is to announce that the master of your honourable mansion, fan chin, has passed the provincial examination in kwangtung, coming seventh in the list
today she sent me back ahead to have a look, and i’m to go out of the city at the fifth watch tomorrow to meet her
his wife, holding back her tears, went to tell the lady dowager that yuanchun was ill and they were to call to pay their respects to her
he also set a table there with incense−burners, candlesticks and pennons to call back the spirit
as she said this a maid came from lady wang to summon xifeng, who took her leave of li wan
i lost my mother when i was a child, and was lucky to have a few peaceful years here with you, auntie
she asked her age as well as the hour, day and month of her birth, and wanted to know all about her family
do not tell me he's in charge!
seeing miaoyu turning away, she guessed that bao yong must have offended her
there's no time like the present
who is there now to speak so sweet and low?
at the start, his subordinates were apprehensive and tried in all manner of ways to ingratiate themselves with him
he desisted then, demanding with a smile, will you talk that way any more?
and jingui, besotted by her infatuation, indulged in the wildest fantasies which blinded her to his real attitude to her
though my heart aches, i haven’t many tears to shed

luckily for them, the assistants had taken quickly to their heels; so none of them lost their lives
going back inside, they discovered daiyu just about to sit down on a chair, panting for breath
miaoyu was wearing a nun's cap, a pale grey plain silk tunic under a long, sleeveless checked jacket with dark silk borders, a yellow silk sash and a white skirt with dark designs

daiyu had not intended to make a special trip to thank baochai that could wait until next they met
the other day i was walking under a plum tree when a bee brushed past my face, and just as i flapped it away that aunt of yours spotted me

they forced me to drink half a goblet
now that baoyu has recovered, he said to his wife, '~how are we to raise the reward?

the next day before setting off on her journey, tanchun came to say goodbye to baoyu who was, of course, most reluctant to see her go

one of the secretaries was instructed to make out an invitation, and the following day servants were sent with a carriage and sedan-chair to fetch miaoyu

bending over daiyu, zijuan asked her softly, do you want some water, miss?
on the fifteenth you can go out with our nephew to watch the lanterns, and on the seventeenth or eighteenth we will call a boat and go with you to mr yang's house

how heartless he is!
because i did not understand a word
today we have a female entertainer too
i suppose it’s your cousin’s illness that’s worrying you?
ma chun−shang walked on till he came to a huge gate on which was written in letters of gold: the monastery of pure compassion, founded by imperial decree
besides, she’d no idea you were ill she must have come to talk to sheyue about something else and, happening to find you in bed, said she’d come to ask after you
as he left he pulled he san out too
the two of them drank till dusk, when sheep−horn lanterns were hung from the hundreds of trees, some high some low
his landlady, mrs tung, came out leaning on a stick
but when he reached the house and saw four attendants in red and black caps in the doorway holding whips, he was too frightened to go in
they cried out merrily, we’ve gate-crashed to offer our congratulations
why should i go on to make fun of myself?
who knows what dirty old woman has been using them?
est are to be confiscated according to regulations
daishu, who had not yet left, came over to greet her
that’s what i’ve done, but you may not approve
the first of the third month is the mistress’ birthday; the ninth is cousin jia lian’s
they had just started their meal when the old lady sent for xiluan and sijie to join them
my son is only an ignorant boy, he said to the student, while you, sir, are a respectable scholar
with that he told the servants to take wu jinxiao away and entertain him well
please wait here, mr kuo, while wu shu and i fetch the letter
i am not being modest
they were still at it after midnight when they heard a clamour from the inner apartments
does xiren know this?
tu read: a despatch from governor li regarding the recommendation of men of talent
we do not need such a large junk, said feng
only daiyu teased, drag her off, quick!
a handsome young man answered from the crowd, and when he came forward the examiner asked him: are you related to mei chiu who was here just now?
he then led the two young maids behind a rockery
and even if your ladyship didn’t slap our faces for coming, your stewards might take us for tramps
i was just a little too anxious for him to grow up quickly
but what's to be done about madam's illness?
ching lan−chiang bowed deeply to express his admiration; but the two old men did not trouble to ask their names
of course i do
i ordered all the maids to keep quiet, said xifeng
why haven’t i seen her all this time?
mr tung was the first to speak
lord she, once he had the fans, asked master lian, how did he succeed where you failed?
a hen-pecked young profligate takes
though caught out at last by her mistress,
baoyu hung around for a while before going back to the garden, and as soon as he had gone the old lady said:
spring departs with the flowing water and fallen blossom, far, far away as heaven from the world of men
there’s no need to dose her with medicine
he has merely to mention the matter and, if you will pardon me for saying so, you will find yourself like a rat in scalding water!
recently, no doubt, he has frequently asked your advice
why have you come?
i’ll recommend someone to take charge for you
it's his birthday today and all our friends will be there
if your daughter does get a good post, seems to me she’ll be wanting our help even more often, and only if we give it will she do all right

and the men i showed it to said you had done a very careful job, in addition to being so fast
finding the one who should fulfill their fate
but i found you’d gone to bed early, and as baochai told me you weren’t feeling too well i didn’t like to bother you
qin zhong took advantage of the fact that nowadays xue pan had virtually stopped coming even to roll-call to make eyes at sweetie and secretly signal to him
she had better give directions for him to move in there too
but as for this ginseng, madam, although it’s of the best quality and costs more than thirty taels of silver an ounce now, it’s too old
you don’t understand,  tanchun told her
then either you or qiuling could be the mistress — wouldn’t you like that better?
she’s even prettier than you
in a couple of days i shall make a full report, and that will take the wind out of your sails
how could a family like theirs be ruined?
demanded hsiao, staying his hand
that evening an attendant announced: someone has come from mr hsun's family
my criminal incompetence deserved punishment by a thousand deaths, but instead the court with gracious clemency sent me to this border region
her eye falling on lady wang beside her, she cried, so you’re all deceiving me, putting on a show of being dutiful but plotting against me in secret
the officer also left without a word
but of course, if you want to be an official and at the same time enjoy dr chao's happiness, that's asking too much!
a few days later, in the palace, the emperor consulted the prime minister
still, i don’t think that xiang for sweetness in your name is right, i’d like to change it for another word, if you agree
and then his lordship came out and confirmed this
two days later tu returned the call, and the three men went out to greet him
he’s lived so long as an ascetic, we can already consider him an immortal
proud recluse, with what hermit are you taking refuge?
xiangling answered with a conciliatory smile, a iya, madam!
although they prescribed various medicines, his condition only grew worse

all the officials came to see him off, and having taken his leave of them he once more hired a carriage and drove out of changyi gate
and the special meal your highness is conferring on jia baoyu is ready now
at sight of it baoyu became lost in thought
the worthiest man nanking has produced, past or present, is tai po,  who founded the kingdom of wu
pinger was reduced to tears too
it's up to you to choose, madam, said lady wang
then xiren released baoyu, who said with a smile, you people think more of the jade than you do of me!
the first half of this made sense to yinger, not the last
she had been meaning to raise a great ballyhoo over her daughter's corpse, then appeal to the court for justice, little thinking that the others would inform the authorities first
a small token of my devotion
the nuns nudged the maid
jia qin was a romantic
come on, quick,  madam you cried
these three were the ring-leaders
when wang heard this, he shed tears
meanwhile they were looking at the plum-blossom bough
a pine in a lonely valley
no, he had not drearned last night either
he took the examinations for more than thirty years but never even passed the lowest, because he ca not talk sense
it's prime minister lou, of course
no, i have not trained him for the stage
since ma had read enough history to know that the capital had been moved south during the sung dynasty,  he was able to calculate that this man must be over three hundred years old
she just blushed and went away
commissionerfan wanted to leave yesterday, replied mr hu
after all, women are so kindhearted, she's bound to excuse my presumption
it’s because i was driven to it by poverty that i thought up this shameless scheme
the only sun now in the capital was a police commissioner named sun shaozu, not yet thirty
dairu stood up as jia zheng entered the classroom and greeted him
they were not joking this time, i assure you
you may still be able to fool others, but you ca not fool me
men laugh at my folly in burying fallen flowers,
even after the lady dowager's sedan-chair had gone a considerable distance, these attendants were still mounting their carriages at the gate, where a babel of voices was heard:
hastily asking one of the younger maids for some paper, she set about loosening her clothes
mercy, kind master, spare me!
stay where you are
since tai po was such a great sage, we all feel it is only fitting that the master of sacrifice should be a man of spotless character
a reeking wind swept down the fields of wheat,
how can you say such a thing, sister, not leaving me a leg to stand on?
then tea and refreshments were served
this is too kind of you, sir!
the other yearns in vain;
but it is better to have nothing to do with forbidden books
you are right, of course
whenever they get a whole root they cut it into two or three pieces and graft other rootlets on to these to be sold, with others, as if they were whole roots; so the size is nothing to go by
good sister, wait for me!
would you be so impertinent to the second mistress?
daiyu shook her head with a sigh
when baoyu said that was right, his father read on:
they invited him into the hall and greetings were exchanged
true, there wasn’t much coming and going outside their gates, but over the wall i caught glimpses of most imposing halls and pavilions, while the trees and rockeries of the gardens behind had a flourishing, opulent look
though i’ve money, i can’t spend it as i want
she had three or four slave girls and nurses to wait on her, as well as two maids called tsai−ping and shuang−hung, both of whom were exceedingly pretty too
shiyin, hearing this clearly, wondered what it meant
together: a lonely boat moored by a chain
it's all right now!
why do not you protest?
but if heaven takes pity on me and lets my children live to see times like those under emperor hung wu, i shall die content
you stupid creature to frighten me so, cried daiyu
with a laugh, prefect wang rejoined: it shows that the old saying 'three years of good government—one hundred thousand taels of silver' is not always true
he rounded on beiming
when it snows, i’ll excuse myself on the pretext of illness, so as to save you trouble, while xifeng and i reap all the benefit
quite apart from the girl's looks where would you find another with such ladylike manners, so polite and yet so firm and principled?
what do you know of this fellow chang?
chin told his steward to go to the back of the study and see who was shouting
not everyone is a termagant like you
baoyu tossed and turned for another hour or two, not falling asleep till the fifth watch
after the customary greetings, mr tsung declared that while with the prince of chao he had written poems with the seven famous scholars of the capital; whereupon tu remarked that two of them were his uncles
that’s all right, chuckled zhan
just give me that small one, she said hastily
yuner had no choice but to take her pipa and sing:
he had a rather sallow complexion and eyebrows which rose obliquely, like a portrait of the god of war
after deducting taxes and expenses, we should still net a profit of several hundred percent
last time i went home i had an embroidered dress made for mother too
tanchun boxed mrs wang’s ears
the milky way is twinkling,
she wept and sobbed at home but no one took any notice, till they found she would disappeared
with another glance at baoqin, xiangyun said, she’s the only one here fit to wear this cape
pinger and xiren had paired off together too, and were indicating the numbers they guessed with their fingers, which set their bracelets tinkling
just then zijuan heard daiyu coughing as if she had got up
with that she retired angrily to her room
but she also had a daughter two years younger whose infant name was baochai, a beautiful, dainty girl of great natural refinement
what's happened now, fourth brother feng?
this elder sister of yours is a very good daughter-in-law, not like my elder son’s wife who’s so afraid of her husband she only makes a show of compliance to me
good sisters, let me off,  she begged
what can this mean?
in less than half a year, when my money comes in, i’ll redeem them and return them
it's only right for me to help you
lost in admiration of everything about him, he asked the fairies’ names
what is your personal name?
no, what you want to do is to send someone to frighten him into giving you several hundred taels and letting you have the girl for your wife without payment
what nonsense you do talk, you stupid thing
if a relative of one from our household died, how much was given?
with that she went off in her carriage
though the sun's set, the ground is still hot
just leave it to me, replied xifeng, rather puzzled
we can’t afford that!
xue pan was overjoyed and passed on this message to his mother, who promptly set to work with baochai, xiangling and two old nurses to prepare his things
now that sobbing and wailing assailed him wherever he turned, his mind became more unhinged and when others wept he joined in
a young girl, to while away time,
so i am an only child like you, and i thought that would make for an affinity between us
that to what purpose did i linger still?
he has no sense of shame, and neither have you!
he crept out to try the gate and found it securely closed
if i had not told them, retorted the boatman, they would have smashed up my boat, the savages!
today you two gentlemen have come neither to take advantage of me, nor because you suspect me
xue pan had already been there for some time with a number of singing-boys, jiang yuhan, an actor who played female roles, and yuner, a courtesan from brocade fragrance court
when they entered the room, teng bowed to wang
that’s why i’ve had no time to call on you
he had charged straight in
there were two hundred sampans at the shore, and out from the bank sprang two hundred savage−looking men
he started by carrying a little merchandise only, but later he sold licences and was able to trade on a big scale
a wretched crank they call the stone idiot had twenty old fans as it happened, but though so poor that he’d hardly a bite to eat, he’d sooner die than part with them
sir, said chih heng−shan, if the ground is dry and warm and free from wind and ants, you can bury your parents safely
after two months here i can see that master bao, with his disposition and scholarship, will go far
after chanting this he burned the silk and poured a libation of tea, still reluctant to leave the place
do not you worry about me
we’re all cousins alike, so when they offend anybody i ought to apologize
ifyou wear clothes like that, what can the scholars wear?
after all you gentlemen left for the capital, he told them, my father looked after the graves and did so well that he was able to buy some nearby fields
i shouldn’t do such a thing, of course, but as i’ve already got a bad name — why not?
it’s too good for the rest of us
you don’t have to help out here
why not come and stay with me?
lots of people are getting married
xifeng promptly sent for the actresses and gave orders for tables to be brought and a red carpet spread
you’ve met your match now
as she started out he said with a smile, wherever you go, i’ll go with you
you would better be on your guard!
but baoyu would not take no for an answer and at last she yielded to his importunity
this worthless young master set in charge
that doesn’t follow, put in yucun, grown suddenly grave
when he came out of the rocky grotto that day after a séance, he saw you reading in the bookshop; and when the shopkeeper asked you your name, you told him you were the mr ma who had edited that volume of essays
he paced up and down, hands clasped behind his back, unable to hit on any way out
yet when they sent to make inquiries, it seemed nothing was amiss
they’re inlaid not with jade but with the finest marble carved with landscapes, figures, pavilions, flowers and birds
miaoyu commented, another stanza, but how mournful!
that will save the money in her chest the trouble of beckoning twice
then one of the women continued, one year, old mr wang sent his son to take the examination in the capital
at the end of the courtyard were five great halls, the largest of which held tai po's shrine, with a table before it bearing incense urns and candlesticks

from these two incidents, viewed dispassionately, i saw how obliging he is towards us girls he knows how to make himself agreeable to us
another thing, continued lady wang
after asking her for a written statement, the magistrate decreed that the matter should be decided by the clan
is baoyu the king of heaven?
the two vessels were lying alongside, and although on different boats they were very close, so the young man petted her till she smiled and climbed into his cabin, and they had a night of love
xifeng did not know what had happened, and the others were mystified too until hupo explained:
she burst into tears
then with final thanks granny liu took her leave and withdrew with yuanyang to the maids’ room
granny liu, who knew pinger's status from her last visit, scrambled off the kang to greet her
then he presented the letter to baoyu
that’s the finishing touch, they cried, chuckling
i just came to see what you’re doing
and seeing that there was not much left, he gave the whole bottle to fangguan who took it away
you think you’re as rich as a mint-master
i do not know whether your excellency belongs to the same chou family
all was strangely quiet in lady wang's apartments, where she sat in the inner chamber shedding tears all by herself
look, the only green things left are those bamboos
when i got tired of waiting i went on my own to pay my respects to the old lady, and i was just going to see lady wang
both of you should pay a forfeit
it’s kind of you to think of them, remarked lady wang
have we really passed it?
smiling, baoyu told them what he had just eaten
since you have brought this up, madam, i would like to ask your advice about something that's been worrying me for a long time
the young gentlemen have arrived, said chou chi−fu
though we live in the country, we have big money-bags there too who own thousands of acres of land and hundreds of cattle, not to mention pots of silver
but our friend dr chao is such a famous poet that all the high officials call on him; and when people see a sedan−chair with yellow umbrellas  at his gate one day and seven or eight runners in red and black caps they ca not help standing in awe of him
the senior eunuchs and ladies-in-waiting were also entertained by members of the staff of both mansions, leaving only three or four young eunuchs in attendance
her ladyship knowing doesn’t matter much,  xifeng observed
wang teh gave a sarcastic laugh
i haven’t the heart to cut down their attendants, and i doubt if the old lady would agree to it either
if we meet too often we wo not enjoy it, predicted tanchun
i did not talk like an idiot, dad, protested chen ssu−yuan
they exchanged greetings and sat down
has miss lin ever talked such disgusting nonsense?
to earth's extremities i sought my bride,
what's wrong with having a bit of fun now that they are married?
but there seemed to be a mill-stone round her neck and her legs were as limp, her steps as faltering, as if treading on cotton-wool
then you can come aboard
in the ning mansion
but now that i have some money, why should i ask you to spend any more on me?
the jia family of the rong mansion
this matter is urgent
a few maids were emptying on to the floor some sacks of dates, pumpkins and other farm produce
if wafted by winds or pressed upon by clouds, it is thrown into agitation and traces of it may escape
we’ll see if you can go on being so cheeky then
go ahead with whatever you have to say, prompted tu
a true confucian is born in changshu county
the bystanders and neighbours could hardly suppress their laughter
a little thing like this might throw other people into a fearful flurry, but i know you’d have no trouble handling bigger things than this, madam
and hsiao made a mental note of this
he and fan chin made way for each other ceremoniously, and once inside the house bowed to each other as equals and sat down in the places of guest and host
zhan ziliang paints excellent pavilions in the meticulous style and cheng rixing does superb beauties
this is too much of an honour, he said
let’s amuse ourselves outside
chou chin and fan chin lead miserable lives before passing the examinations, but once they pass they feel as if transported to heaven
— that’s why she dislikes her
he's not here today, is he?

trust you to think up such a phrase
now what’s the girl up to?

if the horse is here, the rider can’t be far off
let us turn back now to zhou rui's godson he san
what other petition have you?
there’s nothing to be afraid of
he is the gentleman who wants to marry
the two women stood up, beaming, to thank her profusely and make a show of declining; but on xiren's insistence they accepted the tip
for all you’re so handsome, you’re nothing but a fire-cracker without powder — good only for show
and though madam you came over every day she dealt only with routine matters, careful not to overstep her authority
yet to riches and rank each aspires;
he cried, gnashing his teeth
but it has never yet been put to the test
jia lian went ahead to the old lady's place and whispered to jia zheng that all the preparations had been made

when lady wang sent to ask for baochai, arid baoyu knew that the monk was outside, he hurried all alone to the front crying out, where is my master?
if i wish you harm, may heaven and earth destroy me too, she sobbed
i told them i belonged to the west mansion and broke out, but those fellows would not let me go
if anyone is unkind to her, she must say so and not treat us as strangers
her eyes brimmed with tears again
her boots were of green leather
i have already spent a few taels, and must keep a few more for my journey to hangchow
baoyu stamped his foot and sighed
is the answer flower’?
xichun told her all that had happened the night before and showed her the ingots found among ruhua’s things
it should not take more than a couple of days to mend them, and i shall ask you only for the midday meal
that same instant up come two stewards' wives from the feng family
how farsighted and circumspect pinger is!
tang shih joined them at table
the two stewards whose indents she tossed back withdrew very sheepishly
it had to be kept a secret, and i was just beginning to feel better, able to get out of bed
zijuan nodded and said to jia lian, the gentleman is absolutely right
luckily there was still a bit of cow bezoar left, and it’s ready now
yuanyang went back to report this to the old lady, who in elation sent her back to urge aunt xue to explain the situation to baochai so that she would not feel unfairly treated
if the blossoming of the crab-apples was a good omen, he shouldn’t have lost the jade
she came over dizzy and after a fit of coughing spat out a mouthful of blood
it wasn’t because they had offended me
why is xiuyan engaged to my younger cousin before my brother’s engaged?
then manao was sent by the lady dowager to ask:
there are even inscriptions on the jade, isn’t that extraordinary?
yet instead of trying to keep her away she blatantly brings her here to carry on in that shocking way, not caring if people laugh
that was my misfortune, replied jia yun with a smile
your honour will naturally be invited
wuer decided to share the gift with fangguan; so she wrapped up half of it in a piece of paper and as it was now growing dark, with few people about, slipped through the flowers and willows to find her friend
i’ve sent to find out what’s up
closely connected as we are, it was my duty to attend to your mother's funeral, said mr chang
they asked in surprise

even in her own quarters she’s turned down two or three requests
that's a large printing centre
he stamped frantically in anger
throw him out, quick!
but although she lay down her thoughts turned to the crab-apple trees
then in his own hand he drew up a moving appeal on white silk, signed it with his own name and sealed it with the tungkuan county seal
this is made of peacock feathers and gold thread,  she observed after examining it carefully
if your son disciplines his son, it is for the honour of our ancestors, he pleaded
the clear notes woke the echoes all around, and the birds alighted in the boughs to listen

don’t you know who this miss pinger is?
she brought out another plate for fangguan, adding, wait, i’ll brew you some good tea
we’re never told the details of their intimate family life or daily meals
after a few moves, ma realized that this was no common player
welcome guests who were treated with favour they announced; but those who were cold-shouldered they turned away, even if they were relatives, fobbing them off with excuses
tossing it into her lap, he turned to go
jia zheng went out and saw it was jiao da
it really is egg—plant, they assured her
i shall be delighted to participate in such an important ceremony, replied tsang
what’s there left for me to live for?
choking with anger daiyu burst into tears
if you have any trouble, uncle, he said, do not be afraid to tell me
otherwise people might say we’d drunk monkey’s piss
we mustn’t ever mention it again
let's all give our ideas for general discussion
this would be only right and proper
that’s why, in my dilemma, i told you that fib to see how you felt about it
set out too was a crimson gauze screen in a carved purple-sandalwood frame embroidered with flowers and calligraphy
i wonder where it comes from
by the third watch when all was still, armed with daggers and narcotic incense they climbed on to the high wall and saw from the distance that there were still lights in green lattice nunnery
after a second's thought he said, since moving out of the garden because of my illness, i have been living in the hack and have not been allowed to come here for months
did no one ask where you were going?
he greeted niu yu−fu and asked: what brings you here, great−uncle?
his eyes were red with weeping
and on both sides below the steps, tall vermilion candles blazed like golden dragons
she’s by way of being your honour’s benefactress
i’m better today,  remarked daiyu
busy as you are every day, madam, do you still have time to do needlework?
they took their places at both ends of the hall and the courtyard
now you are dead i come to bury you;
that evening, in strict confidence, they sent mrs song off on this errand
then daiyu told a maid to fetch her favourite chair from the window for lady wang
you’re using the same image again,  objected daiyu, but went on:
they made a clean breast of things, both admitting to sleeping with the assistant, and the assistant joined in the quarrel too
we’re afraid it’s epilepsy, was the reply
or xi shi's mournful spirit fair as jade
vain are all these idle tears,
what do you say to that?
li wan made some lucky throws and captured several of the old lady’s pieces, at which yuanyang inwardly chuckled
the assistant magistrate says that mr wan has one really intimate friend and that if you mention that you are on good terms with that man, he will have complete confidence in you and trust you with everything
as each of them has two maids, that makes one string less
if you’ve no consideration for his mother, at least have some for lady wang
yen worshipped heaven and earth and the ancestors, then sat down to a feast with his new wife opposite him and the nurse and child sitting at one side of the table
now the time had come for the wake
her wanton coquetting had deprived them of speech
then the two of them began to lay their plans
just before you went over to the other house you told me to have them pasted above the door, yet now you ask where they are
then sheyue threw nineteen and it was xiangling’s turn
slightly reassured he pleaded, sister, why should you threaten me too?
sheyue quickly passed it to him and while he wrapped the cape up turned to wink at xiren
in this passage the sage explained how his learning and understanding improved with the years; that is why he specified clearly his attainments at fifteen, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty and seventy, to show different stages of development
i went to your honourable house yesterday, replied lu, and came on here today
there were about a dozen serving−women with them, who changed their dresses too
with a cuff, he knocked pin−niang over
depend on it, this is the reason
even if she wanted to, it’s not in her power
after grieving awhile he reflected:
hsiao went to his bedside to ask after his health, and described all that had happened since he joined the army
nowadays we ca not count on others help~ng us out, replied jia lian
you must consider yourself above the rest to disobey me like this
scholars like myself who reach officialdom through proper channels are imperial tutors whose pupils are the sons of nobles
one of my works published the year before last has already been reprinted three times
why ask me if i’ll have her?
when they had breakfasted, mr wei brought out the wine and added ten catties of new wine to it, then ordered the servants to light plenty of charcoal and pile it when it was red by the cassia trees, setting the jar of wine on top
ca not you take a joke?
but let us return to baochai who reached home to find her mother doing her hair
even your sister knows it was you
but before he could answer a young maid came out, and he and hongyu hurried towards the house, walking side by side, not keeping their distance from each other
i’ve forgotten to bring my pouch of betel-nuts,  he said
qin ye was a poor official, but the whole jia household, high and low alike, thought so much of riches and rank that in the interest of his son’s career he had to pinch and scrape to get together twenty-four taels of silver as a handsome entrance gift
the next day aunt xue invited zhang dehui to a meal in the study at which xue pan presided, and standing in the back corridor she urged zhang very earnestly through the window to take good care of her son
i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang’s mother too
the others had been surprised by beiming’s report
who’s been asking the servants for money?
as second master’s personal attendant, you must know the whole story
this is all there is left, so he’s given it you with the bottle,  fangguan explained
besides, that part is just by the ancestral temple
they heard another commotion, and jia zheng was wondering what to do when a wailing went up inside, master bao is dying!
she exclaimed, what is it?
when madam you sent a servant for the third time to fetch her she said to keqing, take good care of yourself
far better come to us
the door opened and out stepped pinger with a large copper basin which she told fenger to fill with water and take in
'if you do well elsewhere, so much the better,  he said
when doctor wang found such a company assembled, he paid his respects to the lady dowager before taking baoyu’s hand to feel his pulse, while zijuan had to stand there with lowered head, to the doctor’s astonishment
baoyu made no answer but found the path and walked on
when ma chun−shang had asked after the tombs, he brought the conversation around to the casket
this said, he darted off to catch up with the chair
he said his boss, wan hsueh−chai, has two boatloads of salt which will be sent off in the next couple of days, and he hopes we will travel with them and keep an eye on them
my late husband had a little property, said the widow
in three or four days, after reporting to my superior, i shall set out on a surveying trip
mu nai, at his side, could not understand what had upset him
xinger fell on his knees to kowtow
then he noticed how each time his nephew opened his mouth it was your worship this, and your worship that
there’s no need for that if you’ve already made the proposal
i’ll go and have a look
presently baoyu and baochai threw dice with the same number
she burst out crying
i also reprimanded the servants several times, and lately they’ve behaved better
and before it was light he called a servant−boy, and secretly bade him send in two of the stewards in charge of rents
feng questioned him closely and learned that the night before, when everyone else was sleeping, he had leaned out of the cabin to watch the girl in the sampan
if you can get someone he's afraid of to slap him in the face and say, 'it's all a joke
so the matter was settled and old pu went home
then although so eager to hear more, she confided, dear child, i am glad you are so understanding -- that's exactly how i fed
xiren, who had overheard them, now hurried in
tea had been served three times and they now took off their outer gowns and sat down to discuss the transfer
if nothing is done, they can make things hot for him
let none disturb these chequered shades,
the scholars, looking round the pavilion, saw that it had windows on all four sides and was surrounded by water
she therefore came over the day before the wake, when she recalled the old lady's goodness to her, then thought of her own wretched fate
if your boy wants it, make haste and write out a statement of his antecedents
i had a husband-and-wife orchid,  she told him
i promise not to
three days later a mourning service was held and further masses were performed while waiting for jia zhen
so you knew we’d lost some things recently,  remarked baoyu with a smile
i thought you were ill, child, the old lady exclaimed
baoyu appeared very willing
in future i promise to do better
baoyu noticed that her eyes were red from weeping
who has planted this flower before the frost under the moonlight?
what a good girl!
i know you are good at drinking games, madam, chuckled aunt xue
our dynasty lives up to this prediction
suddenly granny liu recalled having heard that rich folk had in their houses some kind of full-length mirror
accordingly, the first thing the next day, jia rong went back to the city to see old mrs you and tell her his father’s proposal
in our family except for madam lian who’s too busy with household affairs and, besides, can’t write all the ladies are going to write copies, some more, some less
if you dare kick feng in the groin, you will deserve your reputation
after my second sister's marriage, though, all the girls died or were married off
now tell me this
her deafness made baoyu frantic
i’ve never heard of such an orchid,  douguan protested
however, xiren, keeping quiet, heard it clearly
you can be together every day, but it’s rarely i have a chance to visit you; yet you pay no attention to poor little me
lady wang said soothingly, you’ve already married this oaf, so it can’t be helped
meanwhile qin zhong had taken advantage of the darkness and the fact that nobody was about to go in search of zhineng
according to ming dynasty regulations, a special seat was set in the room of a successful candidate, who sat down while attendants bowed to him
still, at least the sentiment suits the scene
won’t you wait in the other room for a while?
having got what she required from them she hastily made caiming list these things, then handed them over to the serving-women
now i hear he’s out and you’re not going over there today; besides, this early autumn weather is neither too hot nor too cold; so i’d like to go and pay my meet
she means to return all yours to you as well
quite a good effort
we always live quietly behind closed doors—why do you need me at home?
could your memory have played you a trick?
attendants promptly brought him a longan decoction and after sipping a couple of mouthfuls he got up to adjust his clothes
if he gets into trouble, i’m afraid we’ll be involved
take this to zijuan, she instructed her
three pairs of screws were brought; but all that remained of them was eighteen fragments scattered all over the floor
here in our cave we have few fruits or nuts; we must go foraging
let me just put it in a nutshell for you
the rest agreed, all right
today we may as well let ourselves go, continued the old lady
all admitted that such a thing was even rarer
i will,  promised mrs wang, reassured by this
have you always been in the zhen family or only worked there for a few years?
how much will it be?
pointing to the flower basket on the rock she fumed:
please excuse me, she said
baoyu stepped forward and knelt to do as he was told, but his mother instantly stopped him
he has just gone to sleep after taking his medicine
then xiangling curtseyed her thanks, and xiren went off with the soiled skirt
besides, both the elder uncle who's dead and the second uncle who's alive should be grateful for what you are doing
he was just going to ask for water to wash when a sedan−chair stopped at the gate
jia zheng knelt down and kowtowed
he’s in a bad mood these days  mind he doesn’t beat you
you have done so many secret acts of kindness
pointing an accusing finger at her she swore
you’d better look out, she warned
she pretended that she was, but in fact stayed awake all night
after they had greeted each other, daiyu, who was also there, asked baoyu where he had been
he asked baoyu many questio~number as the two young men saw him out, then left in his carriage
with a smile this girl announced:
he found xiren leaning in the doorway of the entrance hail
when the woman had stepped outside she called:
tell me, what's the relationship between you and baoyu?
asked li wan and xifeng
in happy red court
in that case, joked xichun, when the old lady becomes guanyin you’ll be her dragon maid
as long as i’ve someone like her, i don’t have to worry about going short of anything even if my daughters-in-law or my grandsons’ wives forget it
do you expect silver coins to come rolling in of themselves?
then the whole troop, escorting baoyu on all sides, galloped off
though i still have my son lian, he always listens to his second uncle, and now that we have to live on him naturally lian and his wife will take their side
the hall itself, ablaze with candles and lamps, was so brilliant with silk hangings and embroidered curtains that the ancestral tablets, ranged in their places, were hard to make out distinctly
this speech effectively silenced the young man's scruples
a gift of local products makes
her pink satin breeches were lined with fox fur
now lin ruhai had taught his daughter the virtue of moderation and the harm caused to the digestive system by drinking tea directly after a meal
i know nothing of this affair
you strolled here by accident
but he rushed back to stop her, begging, dear cousin, spare it!
i do not suppose you will come to serious harm, sir, in this lawsuit, he said
she shook the container, took out a slip, and smiled when she saw what it was
he asked then where he could get hold of an incense-burner
the two brothers were wearing official robes and the go−betweens auspicious dress
you haven’t yet drunk the bridal cup but already you’re doing her hair
but if our old ancestress gives too much for baoyu, it wo not be good for the boy and may even spoil his luck
i do not intend to use it
balked at every turn, yen did not know how to save his face
this man had a dingy beard, high cheekbones, sallow complexion and piercing eyes
aunt xue was most grateful and gave them news of xue pan
not seeing daiyu that morning, baoyu went to look for her and found her curled up on her kang
xue pan, jia zhen, jia lian, jia rong and some other close relatives of the rong and ning households were entertained in the outer hall
you were laughing at us not long ago, chin told feng
daiyu made no answer to this
filled with misgivings, cheng began to be hungry
why, miss, what is it?
as soon as the visitors had gone lady wang asked xifeng what she proposed to do now
then they took off their official robes and sat down, while tea was served
may i ask how many sons you have, and whether your wife is in good health?
he can get someone else to make him a better one
by now the show had ended, and pao ting−hsi took his leave
don’t overdo your praise
but in my humble opinion, now that he and the young ladies are no longer children and, what's more, miss lin and miss bao are not members of the family, cousins of different sexes should live apart
ghosts from outside don’t come in unless they’re invited by some family devils
xiangyun stared at xifeng until she said with a smile, here’s another about the lantern festival
the lady dowager, apparently at her last gasp, feebly opened her eyes and quavered, my son, i never thought to see you again!
accordingly they changed her name again
i weep with longing and shed tears, not knowing where to go
in the garden, the lady dowager led her party to enjoy the osmanthus in bloom, after which they returned to the feast and fresh wine was heated
i must say i have not the courage to pass myself off as someone else
when we go back we will fix a date, they told him
without further ado he asked:
your cousin zhen’s wife isn’t an outsider, so such formalities are uncalled for
and they were on such intimate terms, it was no wonder that their schoolmates suspected the worst
they can be excused their lessons today in honour of our guest from far away
whom shall we find as master of ceremonies?
ha she is to be shown lenity and sent to the frontier to expiate his crime
i was wrong, but in future i’ll do whatever you young ladies tell me
that line about ministers of the celestial court must mean that you will be promoted to the rank of prime minister
plenty of glass vases and agate bowls have been smashed before without your flaring up
all right, go and report me to the old lady
zijuan handed the bowl back to xueyan and gently laid her young mistress down once more
where did you learn to behave in this scandalous way?
when feng yuan demanded her back
said they live in some monastery
when jia rong heard this he told the lady dowager and xifeng, zhang hua and his father have fled for fear of being punished for bringing a false charge
you do not think i would let you get into trouble, do you?
if i don’t, and my father knows, he’ll call me an idler
no matter how styles change, the reasoning remains the same
she’s frantic, that’s why she’s sent me to beg you to help
it's not serious, someone shouted
not only can he count on the support of those three other families, he has plenty of influential friends and relatives both in the capital and in the provinces
we’ve been doing nothing but reckoning accounts for others
but if you try to conquer by force, weak as the people of chekiang are, i am afraid they will not submit
when she saw baoyu fit fangguan out as a boy, she followed suit by dressing kuiguan up as a page too
then those relatives and friends streaked off like lightning, leaving jia zheng, jia she and their households livid and trembling with fear
since she was so occupied, the girls called on li wan
after that he knew he could expect trouble, and planned to move to another town
i must meditate at the fifth watch, miaoyu remarked
meanwhile baoyu had scuttled back to grand view garden
recalling what bao yong had said, she felt sure the thieves had seen miaoyu and returned last night to kidnap her
you can’t trust these people an inch, miss
in addition, in an unoccupied room behind her kang hung a seven-star lamp, and under it were straw effigies — some with iron bands round their heads, some with nails stuck in their chests, some fastened with locks
he was wearing an old felt cap, a tattered grey silk gown, the right sleeve and seat of which were in shreds, and a pair of shabby red silk slippers
he washed and rinsed it several times, after which he picked up the pot and poured out half a bowl
jia zheng did not know what rejoinder to make to this
i lost no time in summoning the bailiff and sent word to zhang’s mother too
the general's rank is so high and his sons are both so talented, an old dunce like myself can hardly set up as their tutor!
civil officials are even worse
chin's face turned the colour of earth
he had never been treated like this by jingui and baochan before; yet as the latter said it was to thank him for helping xue pan, this seemed to him quite natural
so instead of praising you, sir, they complain that you do not understand the situation
do us a favour, won’t you, and calm down
well, when you sent me these things, i knew cousin lin must have her share too,  explained b’oyu
when daiyu heard that jia zheng was coming home, she knew he would certainly check on his son’s studies and was afraid baoyu would get into trouble
let’s quietly invite miss baochai and miss daiyu over to play for a short time
when he reached the inner courtyard he found the wicked monk seated on the couch in the central room, a bright sword in his hand
and facing you i treasure every moment
she wanted to send wuer there as a maid but had no one to recommend her
as soon as he arrived, he grabbed all the business with official families
can’t we talk if we want to?
that's what was so strange
his dejection made his old illness flare up again, and instead of answering he grinned inanely
aunt xue said with relief, i was hoping you’d come back to see to our family affairs
sheyue urged the woman, steady on
and now you are sighing again
but the next day he returned mr huang's call, and when they met they started comparing notes
cried baoyu, i may as well wash here to save the trouble of going back to my room
i will set a subject then, and you can write on it tomorrow
i can’t remember too clearly, was xifeng’s answer, but i felt i couldn’t control myself, as if someone was pushing and tugging me to kill people
the red-jade shadows of caltrop apart has tossed;
they all went the nest day to the temple and offered incense, then slept there at the foot of the altar while their spirits waited for the king of hell to appear
yoo suppressed a snort of laughter, and kept old cheng to lunch
xifeng had already left on the pretext of some business, while yuanyang had retired to her room to sulk
she’s worked for me all these years, so i slipped in to see her
their graves are a mass of briars
so saying she entered the room, inspected the embroidery and praised it loudly
get up, ordered lady wang, have another careful search made
in the second place: she gets on well with the older and younger mistresses alike here, and never tries in my name to ask this mistress for clothes or that for money
he waited, listening intently, but no one came
this type of appointment is worse than none at all, rejoined chin
first soldiers and runners marched past two by two
if you pass it, madam, it can be sent over
in the absence of ha she, jia zheng was the head of the house
but as people say this sutra, like taoist canons, is only the shell of truth whereas the prajnaparamitra sutra is the kernel, this second sutra must be included as well to make the offering more meritorious
and after tea had been served three times, he was taken into the bridal chamber for the wedding ceremony, which we need not describe in detail
i knew you’d be no use
i propose that we carry the coffins back into the main hall, and choose a day for the interment later
she has work to do at home
what do you say?
the metropolitan examination was held by the ministry of rites, the test examination by an official appointed by the emperor, and the palace examination by the emperor himself
forty years ago, i spent whole days with your father
is he a relative of yours?
make haste to despatch your business
the two friends rushed furiously in to complain to jia rui of jin rong’s uncalled-for insult
two or three times xue pan, emboldened by wine, stormed at his wife and threatened her with a stick, but jingui simply dared him to beat her
at least we should agree on how often to meet, urged baochai
huge horn lanterns high on both sides of the main gate of grand view garden cast a brilliant light, while all the paths were lit with lanterns too
yuanyang cheerfully assented and cried loudly, the table is covered with legs
in that case, i beg you to be the go-between
even if he’s still living he’ll be in a coma, so it wouldn’t be any use sending for him
she announced that all the men-servants’ wives were to come to her early the next morning for instructions
i have plenty of rooms, he said, when he learned their business
this morning, our teacher set huan and lan some couplets to write
but to know what followed, you must read the next chapter
we ca not count on it, though
i want you to buy something for me today, but don’t let anyone see it
fan chin's wife wailed as she prepared the food in the kitchen
~you need not raise money outside, replied jia lian
the old lady frowned
within three years an end will be put to famine
this is your wedding day, she answered
although it could not be called a large party, they had collected quite a number of people
under the peach-blossom behind seeping fragrance pavilion
she ordered some matrons to deliver the hamper of crabs and tell xifeng that she was keeping pinger there
by the time this was done it was nearly the second watch and after sitting up for a while to chat she sent them all to bed, then retired herself
some suggested a monk, others a taoist, yet others a marionette
then pao wen−ching also ordered his son to stop weeping; but he himself fell ill
i was not in a chair, however, but riding on a donkey; and when i wanted to alight, the attendants would not let me
yingchun was vexed and depressed by her nurse’s disgrace
when jia lian finally came home after completing his business, he went straight to the new house
just tell your master that we are from the minister's house, and he will understand
failing that, i can kill myself
i’ll get you some more
both my son and daughter−in−law have died, leaving me only this lout of a lad who is not yet married although he is already eighteen
won’t you teach me a few of them
who will go with me to keep me company,
it would take too long to tell you that in full
a man often gets a thrashing too when he’s drunk
this should have been cut long ago,  said the maid with a smile
i asked them just now,  said tanchun
in his fury he ordered his own pages to beat them
if i wait till my mother calms down it’ll be too late, because qingwen’s illness won’t wait
the next day as soon as he was dressed, he sat down by the window to grind ink and practise writing in real earnest, instead of going straight to his grandmother
chunyan told him tearfully all that had just happened to her and yinger
no matter with what pains he schools his sons
why treat her so unkindly?
i wasn’t expecting the honour of this visit, so i didn’t come out to meet you,  she apologized
petition on behalf of his brother, a victim of foul play who-has been unjustly accused
fame and achievement depend upon study, not upon any supernatural forces
niu pu returned to the temple in a very bad temper, to sit there glowering
a jar of lichees preserved in honey
wiping her own eyes, she patted the maid on the shoulder
with that she shoved huan forward
when they had finished eating, they washed their hands and rinsed their mouths
she's been spoilt since she was a child, declared the bawd
one can never be too careful,  was baochai’s reply
so it's all the same whether she sees me or not
the old lady must be waiting for you to start dinner
convinced that he had met the goddess of flowers and determined not to let slip this chance, he persisted, if you are in charge of this plant, sister fairy, there must be others in charge of those countless rare flowers
then chih hengshan rolled it up again, and they went on talking
from first thing this morning till now you’ve done so much talking, and you’ve a different argument each time
and praise on this sagacious reign bestow
you must have caught cold
he escorted them out, and tu and chih left
go in quickly, chou chi−fu told her, and bid your daughter prepare a meal for the two gentlemen
an old man like you should not behave so disgracefully, when it will make things worse for you!
now that he had made this row outside, they seized the chance when jia zheng was free to report that bao yong had been drunk and disorderly
it doesn’t really matter whether you listen to me or not, but why carry on like that?
by the time she reached home she had over two hundred
how stupid of me!
don’t worry, poor old thing, said aunt xue, laughing
after that they washed their hands and lit incense, and a pint of beans was brought
since you are going to the magistrate's yamen, you had better travel with me to antung and stay with me while you prepare clothes for your visit to the yamen
she's right, agreed old chin
xiren and sheyue were nonplussed
though mrs zhou was not in charge, as the maid who had attended lady wang to the jia mansion at the time of her marriage she was a person of some consequence, and so quick-witted and ingratiating that all the mistresses liked her
it would be better for me to make the proposal
that evening, as baoyu was quieter, his grandmother and mother returned to their own quarters but sent several times during the night for reports from the sickroom
she turned to keqing
i haven’t drunk any cold wine,  he protested
wei−hsiao, said tu, nobody irritates me more than these people who can talk about nothing except their official connections!
when presently the meal ended, the lady dowager and some of the others adjourned to tanchun's bedroom for a chat while the tables were cleared and another laid for li wan and xifeng
he has now risen to the rank of under-secretary
on the sixteenth the villagers sent in contributions to shen hsiang−fu, who prepared a feast for the new teacher to which he also invited mei chiu, the new scholar of the village
yes, i meant to tell your daughter-in-law, but i was so busy i forgot,  said xifeng
we’ve told qingwen and sheyue to attend master bao
i didn’t hear talk of that but of some scandal
so mrs hua and her son did not press the point
this goaded baoyu into sitting up
xifeng in to sit down
if they just dropped in for a call, well and good
now fangguan brought in a cup of freshly brewed tea which had been cooled in cold water; for even in summer they dared not use ice, as baoyu was so delicate
it’s a present from cousin tanchun
at this, li wan could no longer restrain herself
a man called pao is here from nanking, he announced
although the daughter of a cook, she was just as good-looking as pinger, xiren, yuanyang or zijuan
i was only making a suggestion, said whiskers wang
the next moment whiskers wang came flying in
she ordered her maids to fetch lin zhixiao’s wife to drive the woman away
it’s enough if just pinger stays here
all this was preying so much on baoyu’s mind that the honour conferred on yuanchun failed to raise his spirits
he produced another plot; and this time he bribed a man living to the left of it to say that one night he had dreamed that old mrs shih in ceremonial dress had pointed out this plot to him and signified that she wanted her grave moved here
madam you and madam lou joked to li wan, the one who’s drunk monkey’s piss is playing innocent!
no matter what small alley you enter, you are bound to see at least one house where a lantern is hung to show that tea is sold; and inside the shop you will find fresh flowers and crystal−clear rain water on the boil
the third master has just arrived from peking
it was reported that the culprit was a servant of the former senior imperial tutor jia hua, which reminded his majesty of my ancestor's name, and he asked me what it was
let me tell you, then
it's too bad that in our time even those in refined ladies' chambers have been contaminated
so they abandoned all thought of buying her freedom
her dimpled smile is peach-blossom in spring, her blue-black hair a cluster of clouds
which of the girls is that?
the two brothers received him, and kept him to a meal
before he had gone half a mile, however, he heard someone calling: abbot huei min!
baoyu turned to whisper to sheyue, i didn’t know yuanyang was here too
ask fangguan to come out,  urged wuer
we must set out by boat the day before, so that we can reach his house early and spend a whole day there
what's the idea, lashing out in all directions?
when xifeng was up and about there was someone to scare them, but now they’ll be taking advantage
go on, do not worry about that, said pinger
besides, everyone here from their ladyships down is ever so fond of you
old mr cheng was the head of the brokers' guild
who ever heard of a man falsely claiming a father?
in the ning mansion
beside himself with joy, although he sometimes talked nonsense he behaved quite differently from when he was demented
he was a handsome young man
but i’ve already reported it, and they ordered me to take her there
there haven’t turned to ashes yet ,but they have dried up and lost their potency
i have some slight skill in archery, and can hit anything i aim at within a hundred paces
chih and wu said nothing
soon it was time to go to the examination in the capital
the other day i was sent a couple of bottles of scented flower juice and meant to give them to him, but thought he might waste them
they watched as feng rolled up his right sleeve
he swung himself into the saddle then and his pages escorted him to jia she's house, where he found that his uncle had nothing worse than a cold
after a hasty leave-taking she mounted her carriage with baoqin to go back, amid general consternation
the next day a number of suspects were summoned to court and yucun cross-examined them carefully
the young people laughed and exclaimed, what an idea!
after they had talked for some time, chu hsien−fu rose to leave; and ma chun−shang asked where he lived so that he might return the visit the following day
the new wife brought the wang brothers in to see how he was before they left for the provincial examination
seek the cause of untimely death in a part existence,
now the music, on top of the wine, set granny liu waving her arms and beating time with her feet for sheer delight
wang told him their names, and teng sighed
he charged forward, knocking into everything in his way
i must go to cassia pavilion to find him
he stood up in surprise to greet tinghsi, and invited him to be seated
at once out came several fairies, lotus sleeves swaying, feathery garments fluttering, lovely as spring blossom, entrancing as the autumn moon
now that she was married, she felt it incumbent on her to behave as the mistress of the house, not with the gentle shyness befitting a girl — she must show her authority to keep others under her thumb
she made an old nurse put the broth and dishes in a hamper and carry this behind them while they walked empty-handed to happy red court
when chin reached his door he was shown in by two attendants in brand−new clothes
how can we respect a mistress’ like that?
if my sisters, brothers and cousins are nice to me, i will be nice to them too, regardless of which is the child of a wife or the child of a concubine
are not you my uncle pao?
it was now feng ziying's turn
and his successor too did faith inspire;
and it’s too early by far to talk of learning
our meeting reminds me of mr cheng lien's voyage on the ocean, responded tu
of course, in that society and under the influence of the literati of the time, it was impossible for any man to be completely indifferent to officialdom
baoyu grabbed hold of the cup and started drinking, and before he could speak again zhishan came to fetch zhineng to lay the table
although there’s baoyu, he’s not cut out for the job  even if i win him to my side he’s not much use
she knows very well how it is with our young mistress but never shows the least concern for her
i have heard say, went on the old man, that our dynasty would have been as perfect as the chou dynasty during confucius' time, if emperor yung lo had not seized the throne and ruined everything
you must listen to me so that later, when you become an official, we may meet again
you can punish her any time you please
though baoyu was married last night he didn’t share the same room with his bride, so today we should make him see you some way on your journey
but first zijuan went in to have another look at their young mistress, and found that she had kicked off her bedding again
so xue ke had to let her leave the wine
some others are up on the roof
suppose i first feel the pulse to make my own diagnosis
daiyu for her part was also remorseful after her quarrel with baoyu, but could think of no pretext to go and make it up
why are not you eating anything?
i’m most grateful for you help, sister
the young maids there also denied any knowledge of his whereabouts
what about the third of next month?
tell me all these things clearly, you dog, and i may spare your life
niu pu−yi chanted poems, iron−armed chang performed his sword dance, chen ho−fu cracked jokes, the lou brothers appeared extremely cultured and chu hsien−fu extremely elegant, while yang chih−chung looked venerable and chuan wu−yung eccentric: thus the party was unique
i see now that it's no good basing your opinion of somebody on hearsay
yuanyang assented and withdrew to pass on these instructions to serving-women, who went off to relay the message
his hair was tousled, his face streaked with mud, and one of his shoes had come off
i’ll follow suit,  said aunt xue, and give twenty too
her maids ca not stop her!
at sight of her qiuwen smiled
why should he rush in if not to loot the place?
they made merry till midnight, when the brothers left with their lanterns
staring about her she saw a box-like object attached to one of the pillars in the room, with a weight of sorts swinging to and fro below it
jia rong let go of his aunt then and grabbing hold of the maid kissed her on the mouth
when shall we see you again?
you know the proverb, the empire’s officials control all in the empire
pin−niang was overjoyed, chin hsiu−yi drank his tea and left
please sit down, said mr hsiang, and i will tell you about it
jia lian knew that madam you had made this proposal because she was not on good terms with xichun, who could not take effective charge; and xifeng was too ill to cope
and now a letter came from xue ke which aunt xue had read to her
she had only just married a talented, handsome husband with a cheerful disposition, but then he had contracted this fatal illness which might any day carry him off
her heart is loftier than the sky,
is not your mistress taking medicine?
this girl is perfect for you
ma was seriously wounded, and died a couple of days later, but his body has not been found yet
daiyu, her eyes half closed, took two or three sips, then shook her head and would not drink any more
there were only miao women there
have you recovered completely?
there are some pleasant rooms over there that you should see
turning away, li wan saw that zijuan had vanished and asked xueyan where she was
it was not xiren but qingwen
and at each prefectural town or county seat you come to, show this scroll to the local officials
i won’t have you coming here again tomorrow!
there’s no need to send a feast to the other house
lady xing of the other house often takes yanhong, cuiyun and other young concubines there
i put you to so much trouble the whole year round, don’t stand on ceremony now,  urged the old lady
when he shows so little interest in all those who belong to his household by rights, what time has he to waste on you?
tomorrow i will send sedan−chairs to fetch your wives
this is better than being squeezed by those stewards outside and having to pay them
if you are fond of me, mother, take my advice and now that you are old take better care of your health
at last everyone was able to breathe again
you are drunk again, talking so wildly, they objected
jia zheng arrived in the middle of this dispute
i’m not coming here any more, sobbed qin zhong, if jin rong is allowed to stay
beaming all over his face he said to his second aunt:
baoyu fails to find a true friend
once this trouble blows over we must hurry up and arrange your wedding, and that will be one less thing on my mind
after drinking a few cups of tea niu pu went back to the temple
kuo tieh−shan and i were equally famous in our young days for our skill in the military arts
the patriarch, holding an arrow, asked, who will go and steal sweet taros?
and the next morning niu pu collected the seals, stamped the two volumes and put them away in a safe place
the pages outside say he was at a loss because you would not let him have the jade
i know him, of course, but not well
if they need help, madam should use her own discretion
on second thoughts he decided, never mind
simmering with resentment they cursed their fate, for separation in life is harder to bear than separation by death, and saddest of all were the people seeing them off
so now with a radiant glance at him she complied
if he’d never shown up, i’d have stayed single all my life
the prince of xiping will deterrnine what other measures to take according to the earlier decree
just now, said niu, when i learned from your uncles that your father was no longer with us, i felt very sad
next time your master wants baoyu to meet or entertain guests, you can tell him without reporting it to me that i have forbidden the boy to set foot outside the second gate until after the eighth month
as he and his wife watched by the bedside, weeping, he gave orders for the funeral; and when evening came the old lady breathed her last, so that the whole household was in a ferment all night
i am ashamed to display my incompetence before a connoisseur like yourself
steamed-bread convent was the popular name for water moon convent because of the good steamed bread made here
the other two seeing that he was drunk ignored him, simply putting out the light, then lying down to sleep as best they could
what do girls like you know about such things, child?
the lady dowager smiled and pointed at daiyu
i know what to do when i am sent for
your cousin knows best whom to send
theat’s all we ask
yu yu−ta was disgusted by the way they talked
go to cassia pavilion at the end of the north corridor, he read, and ask for lai hsia−shih, who is newly arrived from yangchow
being a cosseted girl from a wealthy family, the anxiety on top of her night-long exertions brought on a fever, she was unable to eat or even drink water
if he's a minister's son, how dare people cheat him?
don’t be afraid, my child, said aunt xue
the meal at an end, baoyu went back first to the garden as he had qingwen on his mind
re then retired to his room
jia lian stood up hastily too
yu yu−chung felt relieved of a crushing load, and wrote to recall his brother
i’ll keep it for you, and let you have whatever you want when you need it
jingui had meant to make a show of annoyance, but now his flushed cheeks, sparkling eyes and appealing expression had melted her anger away
as long as i live i shall try to repay your kindness!
the wine’s cold but you’d better take a sip, old ancestress, to wet your gullet before debunking their lies
how should i for my sallow features care?
because yuanchun had borne no son, her posthumous title was virtuous and noble imperial concubine, according to the rules of the imperial house
baoyu, disappointed as he was, could hardly leave at once
it's true that in a place like nanking even cooks and porters are cultured!
chen ho−fu, at your service
the two brothers were chuckling to themselves, when the boatman opened the cabin door and asked lou feng to step on deck where the bullies could see him
but soon repenting other counsel heard
the instructions read, all the feasters must drink a cup by way of congratulations, for this is the queen of the flowers
i’ll make a guess,  said daiyu
don’t believe a word of it
baoyu stopped eating, rinsed his fingers and sipped some tea while exchanging a few more remarks with the two nurses, who then took their leave and were seen off to the bridge by qingwen and some other girls
the constable protested, if they did not break in openly with torches and clubs, how can you call them brigands?
responded lung san reproachfully
even if you didn’t see me, we called you at the top of our voices a dozen times, but that only made you run the faster
how long can you go on like this—neither fish, flesh nor fowl?
how do you know?
one of the servants accompanied the chair to a house with a big gate by the riverside
unfurl the sail and fit up your oars to row back
and now that he has a fortune he has come to settle down in nanking
to miss baochai’s place
he was my father, replied tu, surprised
at any rate you will have to go
at this, daiyu broke out in a cold sweat
at last, at about eight o'clock, his sedan−chair turned up, with two men running before and behind it carrying two torches each
last year, chu−ko told hsiao and chi,  examinershen set a poetry test for students from twenty−seven counties in our prefecture
after i left, did sister xiren send anyone to see sister qingwen?
i use one hundred and twenty different ingredients which complement each other just as do a prince and his ministers, and co-operate with each other just as do a host and his guests
we shouldn’t play this game,  she declared with a blush
next came a picture on a beautiful woman hanging herself of a tower, with the verdict:
it need not worry us, agreed mrs pao
xiren sent a maid to urge them, stop that noise
as people say, the way to happiness is never smooth’ and nothing can prevent a match made in heaven
but hitherto i have had no opportunity of making your acquaintance
baochai and xiren too, it goes without saying, encouraged him to work hard
strolling in he found the bamboo portiere down
and in that case, if xiren's pay is not cut cousin huan ought to have a maid with the same pay as well, to be fair
the mistress made people help her back to sleep; but because of that commotion outside we did not get her a doctor
at sight of zhen baoyu he felt as if they were old acquaintances, while young zhen too had the impression that they had met before
do as you think fit
how can we put up with that?
alas for the ning mansion, once so grand!
the girl's delight: a good fuck
in those days the price of a salt licence was high, and when he had made forty to fifty thousand taels of silver he bought his freedom, purchased this house and set up in the salt business himself
haven’t you noticed recently how she’s been avoiding you?
now that jia zheng had inherited the title and apparently still enjoyed the emperor's favour, they hurried over to offer congratulations
but what reason has anyone to hate baoyu?
he was unable to leave before the end
as he said this he winked at his second aunt
dear cousin, let me off
then all the family, great and small, began to wail and prepare for the funeral, placing the coffin in the central hall of the third courtyard
whenever i miss some dead friend, whatever the date, i burn incense and offer some fresh water or tea, or maybe flowers or fruit, or even meat or vegetables
old chin hastily called his son to make tea, kill a chicken and cook some meat to entertain the bailiff, and asked wang mien to accompany them
we told aunt xue, and she was only too willing
after jia lian reached pinganzhou he called on the governor to settle his business, and was told to come back again before the tenth month
this is only everyday family fare,  put in lady wang
xiren overtook him to ask what was amiss
when she entered xifeng’s room with her hair dishevelled and her costume rumpled, like a frail beauty just aroused from sleep, lady wang immediately recognized her as the girl she had seen
as she was not wearing a skirt, he could see her pomegranate-red trousers with floral designs and her new embroidered red slippers
she's nothing to do every day and needs something to keep her out of mischief
when the men who were friends with the first ten actors on the list saw the notice, they were delighted
but though baoyu was recovering steadily, he had not overcome his infatuation and he insisted on going to mourn for daiyu
we cannot look for a speedy recovery
being at a loss, she could do nothing except berate xue pan
they were crying out for joy
even if she's busy, you would think she would put in an appearance to please the lady dowager and lady wang
have no fears about that, his secretaries assured him
in this packet the medicines: plum-blossom powder, purple-gold pills, tonic for the blood and restorative pills, each kind wrapped up with directions for its use
i managed to fill that whole dark blue porcelain pot, but it seemed too precious to use so i’ve kept it buried in the earth all these years, not opening it till this summer
first of all, your hearts are at peace, so you are more spiritual and have quiet perception
when the others had left as well, baochai asked xiangyun where she had found the ticket
worried because she was not likely to recover, jia zheng sent to ask leave from his yamen and be and his wife attended her day and night
they may take a little finding
besides, you will need to take quite a few servants south, and as that will leave fewer here i can cut down on expenses and get by
why, this wine has body all right, said lou chan
cousin lin is talking like a southerner, teased tanchun
don’t laugh at me, miss,  cried xiangling
who else is there to see to things?
there's something else i want to ask you, she said
where does that luting come from?
terrified, niu pu asked: what have i done to offend you, great−uncle?
arguing that shooting at random could not improve their skill and might even spoil their style, he imposed certain penalties and set stakes as an incentive to all to do their best
when he comes out, we’ll give him some more silver and that will be that
then the lady dowager saw them out no farther than the inner ceremonial gate
one was that piece, she answered, in which li kui abuses song jiang and then apologizes
now you two are getting on fine, but i’m left out in the cold
before you have got over it, here you are starting again!
regarding himself as the master now, he decided, here's my chance to avenge
strangely touched by this, she stopped to listen
she ordered more wine to be heated, saying, i’ll drink a few cups with you and then we’ll have our rice
hurry up and take that wine back to the temple, and on no account show any despair or panic
why leave your post and come here?
tomorrow we shall have to change this for her
so why not use that line from an old poem:
since the child was so delicate, her lessons were irregular and this meant that his duties were light
since you are one of the ablest officers in kiangsi, if you surrender i will have you promoted
why did not you come last time we sent to invite you?
but he demanded that i pay the interest for all these months
have you asked any other guests?
you just have a good rest
how many girls are there in your family?
to tell you the truth, gentlemen, scholars of the five northern provinces respect my name so highly that they often light incense and tapers to me on their desk, calling me ' master kuang of sacred memory
this is no time for jokes!
the attendant sneered: your honour is right, of course
just then, as luck would have it, up came a nurse with a kettle of boiling water
the girl playing wenbao ad-libbed:
by now the contributions had been counted and they totalled just over a hundred and fifty taels
chu−ko's arrival put a stop to this conversation
it must be the pill i took this morning
kuang ta had just finished gathering together his wares
what more apt than the spring of wuling’?
composing herself a little she said
a whip cracked three times, eunuchs trooped out from the inner palace bearing golden censers of ambergris, and palace maids with long−handled fans escorted the emperor to his throne
go on, he said
tell these novices to get ready at once to drive to town
when did i ever have money from you?
i am very ill, and do not know if i shall see you again
if i were you, i would go to another province to lie low for a time
i do not believe it!
which of us would dare?
baoyu started off with one line:
he says he knows mr wan too
if not for this rumpus you made, our party would have broken up long ago
and when the woman had kowtowed her thanks they left
i have twelve taels here, which have been given me
who was your patron?
we have left it behind the temple until you go back for the burial
wasn’t that a young lady i examined just now?
she asked with a smile
this is the green gauze you admired yesterday,  she said
i wouldn’t think of troubling you
do you think you play better than i do?
presently chuang shao−kuang came in, greeted tang, and sat down
after dinner, when baochai had gone to see the lady dowager, she went to bamboo lodge
she rolled up her hair, removed the false tongue dangling from her mouth, took off the iron halter round which the rope had been fastened, and divested herself of the red garment
then jiang yuhan took over
so baochai must have moved out for some other reason
you’ve written just five poems, cousin,  he said
take your hands off me!
if so, how did the name come to be handed down?
you’re wrong there, old ancestress,  laughed xifeng
he said a whole lot, too much for me to repeat, answered mrs lin
if you find an insufficiency of grain, horses or other supplies, please use this sum to make good the shortage
we shall see if anything comes of it or not
even if i had two mouths, i could not get through all the eating
so far no evidence has been produced
otherwise you might abuse me for selling it too cheaply
then a messenger summoned them back to xifeng, who had washed and changed to remove the dust of the journey
we must celebrate for a few days and invite all our relatives
by painted pavilion grow willows and flowers untold;
that's not hard to settle, said old pu
the mutilated pouch, the fan-case in two or three pieces and the snipped off tassel were on the little table; and daiyu, clutching two old handkerchiefs with writing on them, was gazing at them in tears
her powder and red chamber, her youth and beauty wasted,
the fact is, this old woman had only one son
she went along the covered corridor to the gate and discovered baoyu there, drenched as a drowned cock
the idle screens gay ducks and drakes enfold;
she played until it was late ,then called zijuan in to clear up and went to bed
or am i forbidden to see him?
shutting his mouth and closing his eyes, he munched slowly
feng really ought to give me that silver
now she remarked with a smile, if we are to play drinking games we must call yuanyang back
yours is bound to be good, so let’s hear it
the mystified taoist placed refreshments on the table and busied himself with the tea; then he produced a volume of poems from his sleeve and asked for tu's criticism
then later, if you pass the examinations, you will find better teaching jobs
she lodges in handkerchief lane by palace pool, where clients will find her signboard
the old lady's waiting for you
no, i really must be going
don’t ask me,  said xifeng
oh, no, you don’t,  laughed baochai
they control this household and run everything but pay no attention to you, their only younger sister
then there are others like li guinian, huang fanchuo, jing xinmo, zhuo wenjun, hongfo, xue tao, cui yingying and zhaoyun
so jia qin became their lover and whenever they had the time they would get together and learn how to sing and play the fiddle
why pin it on me?
but after one sip he put it down—the tea was cold
all our income and expenditure were entered in the accounts by lai da, wu xindeng and dai liang, and you can check on them by asking them, sir
xiren drew a picture of peach-blossom with the motto exotic scene at wuling’ and the line another spring returns and the peach blooms red
recently i was entrusted with the purchase of flowers, and thanks to your great influence i have been able to make the acquaintance of many gardeners and visit many celebrated gardens
but it’s not very fair for the two mistresses to give less themselves, only sixteen each, and not to pay for anybody else either
you’re my goddess, he panted, going all out
in one respect only had she been unlucky
so she said, fetch them, and we’ll see
and i came back too late in the evening to see her again, so how else can i have offended her?
i thought you wanted to pass the examinations in order to go up in the world, and that you had bought essays to study
especially when, a few days later, some old eunuchs came with gifts and silver from her, announcing that her highness wished to express her gratitude for the family’s concern, and apportioning each one’s share
but as the proverb says, 'public business comes before private affairs
mourning with bitterness my years ill-starred;
they went to a tea−shop, sat down and ordered tea
he told a young maid to light a fire and burned the scraps of the letter
the instructions were: all must congratulate the one who draws this lot and make her drink three cups, drinking one each themselves
the twenty-four young buddhists and taoists from the dharma convent and jade emperor’s temple in the garden had now been moved out, and jia zheng had been thinking of sending them to various temples elsewhere
she can wear new ones every day if it comes to that
wouldn’t that be nice?
what does it matter?
since your second uncle went to this provincial post, instead of sending home a single cent he's spent a whole lot of the family's money
he's afraid to come
zhang hua, given this cue, acted on lai wang’s advice and wrote out his plaint, taking it the next morning to the court of censors
he will tip you for your trouble
yuanyang, standing there, now whispered to the old woman, do not forget!
baoyu pointed at xiren
when your mother was alive she was ten times better than concubine zhao, so you should be superior to tanchun
she went into the bedroom to tell xifeng the same story
what’s the matter with her?
she’s an honest old soul and on good terms with yinger’s mother
he found in it both condemnation of treachery and criticism of flattery and evil, but it was clearly not written to pass censure on the times
xifeng standing near them smiled
then yuanyang came to announce that dinner was ready
i would not tell this to anyone else but you
the other day, however, when mr lu met prefect chu's grandson in your honourable house, he was struck by his genius
take my word for it, it will be best for you never to meet her all your life
jia zheng, aware that his mother might well be anxious, said with an ironic smile, so sometimes you are at a loss too, you young rascal
though you’ve done some calligraphy, that doesn’t amount to much
i can see the only one who counts for you is xifeng
do not tell him, for instance, how good prefect hsiang was to you
it's only a few months since last i saw you, and now you look so ill!
search all the cells
how are you, granny?
a couplet on the two pillars read:
it’s baoyu — he came here specially first thing this morning and talked like a silly boy
his father is an outsider — he dares not enter
but what can we do when he was born with such a strange cranky temper?
then lady wang and her sister sat up half the night talking
she told zijuan to go back for one then catch her up she would be walking on slowly
caiyun lowered her head in thought and then agreed
he could not tell whether this was said by baochan or jingui, but it convinced him that they were up to no good
they presented the paper, and he read:
why, uncle, i ply my small trade and all i ask is not to lose my capital
still, when i was young and your kinsman mr jia yucun was my tutor, i read a few essays too
hsiao chin−hsuan knelt to pass the grain to dr yu, who placed it on the table
li wan and madam you laughed
you would much better tell the truth and say that your brother is in nanking now, so that they can send a writ there and you will be cleared
he was one of the party at oriole−throat lake, with mr yang chihchung, mr chuan wu−yung, mr niu pu−yi, mr chu hsienfu, iron−armed chang and the two lou brothers
luckily mr chen the apothecary was on hand
but we need not dwell on this
she was too far away to see what i was doing and thought i was picking plums, so she let out a screech, then started squawking at the top of her voice that this fruit hadn’t yet been offered to buddha, that their ladyships being away hadn’t tasted it yet, and that after the best had been sent to the mistress the rest of us would get our share, carrying on as if i were dying for her plums!
as luck would have it, it was just the time for the preliminary test for the provincial examination
she was followed by baoyu, xiangyun, the three jia girls and li wan, and their choices were put on in turn
could not these people have protected them?
our mistress had some peeled for her to taste, but she refused as she’d just been drinking hot tea and said she’d try some later
and butcher hu cursed him again
saying this he took two volumes of poems from his sleeve and presented them to wan hsueh−chai
have you forgotten, sister, that even you sang one too?
he passed her the book
if bandits attack us, i need only draw my crossbow and they will be done for
all present were both frightened and amused
the jia family’s cure for a cold or cough, among masters and servants alike, consisted mainly of fasting supplemented by medication
luckily her ladyship gave me twenty taels of silver yesterday to make clothes for the maids, and i haven’t yet touched it
his father was furious and swore he’d grow up to be a dissolute rake
i’ve even got the title ready for you
when lung san, all his bluster gone, had thanked chin tung−ya and slunk off, the prior took his guests downstairs, greeted them again, and begged them to be seated
at the gate of mr lu's house they sent in largesse to the attendants; then the gates swung wide open and music struck up to welcome them
a stop was put to this discussion by the arrival of wenguan with xiangling, siqi and daishu
soon it was the end of the sixth month
and not wanting her to grieve too much, as baoyu was still bemused xifeng quietly sent someone with the trumped-up message, baoyu is asking for you, madam
sweating with fright, i woke up and rubbed my head, and it still seemed hot
this quip rankled so much, however, that she reddened and laughed sarcastically
i told them you were away, and they put up at an inn, but they have been back every day since
you have obviously bought it to make fun of us, yet you ask whether i like it
would not that be more flexible and greater fun?
they bustled in and out non−stop, and it was our mistress this, and our mistress that all the time
you’re to go to see your father after dinner
in time they’ll turn back into soil
the only thing that worries me is leaving my mother here by herself
he came into the world with three horns on his head and four eyes, eight feet in height, with arms reaching to the ground
shiyin with his innate intelligence at once grasped the other’s mean-
her highness wants more pines and cypresses planted in the northeast corner of the garden, as well as more flowers at the foot of the tower
second sister had married a scoundrel
mrs wang started with the other girls’ cases and, finding nothing exceptionable, went on to open siqi’s case
most of their attendants were pages of less than fifteen, all grown men-servants being debarred from the place
don’t talk about pawning things for a mere thousand taels when i know you could easily produce three to five thousand of ready cash here and now
let me, stupid as i am, explain this to you
they were prefect chu's nephews
the ladies are all in the gallery, one of the girls told her
such things can’t really happen
once you see i’m gone, you can slip out and no one will notice
let me go and notify them, said ting−hsi, smiling
the old lady and lady wang have their titled status of course, but your ten taels a month is twice as much as we get, and yet the old lady and mistress still pity you as a poor widow with no means of support
let us send out a notice for you, sir, suggested yin chao
you’re so intelligent you know the saying: if your arm is broken, hide it in your sleeve
ting leapt in his rage
all the maids admired her goodness, all the nurses praised her kindness
we certainly ca not complain about the way mr chi treated us
there, however, he ran into two of his father’s proteges, zhan guang and shan pinren, who hurried forward smiling
this is all owing to the virtue of our old ancestress, she said with a smile
thereupon xifeng ordered a halt
kaoyao is one of the most famous counties in kwangtung, he continued
how come you don’t realize how heating wine is?
if you’ve taken a fancy to someone, say so outright, and we can make her your concubine to avoid any hint of scandal
can this count as foretelling the future?
seeing the maid kowtow now, she hastily raised her to her feet, shedding tears of contrition and distress
the whole company burst out laughing
why is not rong here?
and so the three of them settled down to sleep
i have no use for the likes of you, was his retort
wang han−cheh clasped his hands in salute without bowing to niu, and took a seat
a trifling matter like taking a man’s life wouldn’t frighten him away
hurry up and bring us some of the birthday noodles!
could this refer to cousin lin?
on the way he heard of the general amnesty and received another letter from home confirming his pardon and official reinstatement
she reported that you’d just started the feast and wouldn’t be back for some time
asked baoyu in dismay
i just want to be prepared
people may call me crazy, but you’re even crazier!
where’s your elder sister-in-law’s contribution?
yes, i have not seen you all for so long, today i had to come
at this daiyu forgot her nausea and rushed over to snatch the jade, seizing a pair of scissors to cut off the tassel
after chatting a little longer, wang hui left
baoyu hastily changed his clothes, then paced up and down frantically, calling for his carriage
even if she were out, pinger and fenger would hardly be out as well
she’s young and inexperienced in these matters, said lady wang
the page did so, saying exultantly, why go yourself, sir?
the other day you even beat xiren, and now you are picking on me
you know that pair of shoes i started the other day?
hupo, knowing that she meant to worship buddha, had placed a red felt cushion on the ground
if you stayed at home you would only sleep the whole day long
my mother’s sister’s child
it’s unheard of for servants from outside to enter the young ladies’ rooms without any reason

jia lian called from the room
now the jias are the bridegroom’s family and the wangs have no one in the capital
i don’t think accounts need be turned in at all,  said baochai
baochai was just giving xiangling some instructions when aunt xue suddenly let out a cry:
but if you kill him today, it means you want me to die too
swallowing her resentment she went on and found xifeng, sure enough, chatting in li wan's apartment
if the dead man is zhou rui's godson, then from her ladyship down the whole household is involved
the runners told him
but he was thinking: our third and fourth masters are a queer couple
but please, miss, for old time’s sake, let me die here with you!
she sobbed even more bitterly, so distraught that she threw up the herbal medicine she had just taken
told to pay his respects, he complied
he was to accuse him of marrying during a period of state and family mourning, against imperial decree and unknown to his parents; of relying on his wealth and power to force zhang hua to renounce his engagement; and of taking a second wife without the consent of his first
i’ve reported this to the mistresses
well aware of what he wanted, she only made a show of resisting
when, after the meal, tu mentioned that he wanted to find a house, chih heng−shan was delighted
now that baoyu’s ill, just-leave it to-us to do our very best to find it
at first his father tried to discipline him, but he’s long since given that up
why ask for trouble?
the dice is thrown and wins  the dots are red
if you really love me, aunt, will you be my foster-mother?
so daiyu accompanied her to alpinia court
they hired horses and, accompanied by attendants, set off for kaoyao county
yoo bowed to him and tea was served
when this man saw niu yu−fu he put down his brush and came over
the imperial envoys asked after his father and instructed him, come tomorrow to the imperial treasury to receive your bounty
yuanyang ordered some maids to drag granny liu back to her table
why, cousin, he cried, surely you are sufficiently well versed in ancient and modern literature to know the title of that opera
do bring him in and let me have a look at him
i will get him to meet me in my uncles' home to impress them
nowadays baoyu talks in such an ambiguous way, blowing hot and cold by turns, i can’t tell what he means, she thought
after jiang yuhan had moved on, there was some speculation about him
madam you and li wan shared a third table with xiren and caiyun
why, sir,  chuckled the nanny, lowering her voice, i see now why the boy told me they’d invited a new doctor
this done, he fetched a big iron lamp he had brought from hangchow, filled it with oil and sat by his father's side to read essays
then tanchun came to ask me to call on xifeng with her, but i felt too lazy to go
i remember when i first went there, i no sooner presented my card than he sent two attendants out to help me from my sedan−chair
it’s one that madam lian gave me
i have long wanted to make his acquaintance, but never had the opportunity!
this has always puzzled me
no need to tether these fine steeds with ropes, galloping round the walls how fierce they seem!
if they see this account of your exploits, i am sure they will be glad to write of them
and grub for money all their lives
in a few more days we will pack up and go back
but this time it was really my own fault
the old woman reached out with her chopsticks but failed to secure an egg
the saint's image occupied the middle of the temple; on the left was a stork and on the right a stone slab inscribed with twenty characters
he roared to baoyu’s other pages chuyao, saohong and moyu, all of whom were ready for mischief
so she treated her with contempt
i never expected you to grow so proud that flow you have no use for me while you are so fond of outsiders like baochai and xifeng
the more modest you are, the more respected you’ll be
would you like to meet him?
i can easily fetch them for her
the reason for their fall, not far to seek,
if you copy sutras now, i’m afraid you’ll wear yourself out
have you all finished?
and since he came from a good family, pao would not train him for the stage but made him study for two years before taking him into the business
convinced by this reasoning, xifeng replied, in that case, i will go tomorrow and try
doctor wang felt the pulse for some time, then that of the other wrist, after which he and jia lian withdrew to take seats in the outer room
he’s raving again,  they said
if i find you being too soft, i shall make no allowances for you, even though your family has been in service here for three or four generations
do not you really understand?
after some talk about home affairs, they went to bed
the fact is, this business is more or less solved; we’ve even found out as well who took the things missing from the mistress’ place the other day
don’t let baoyu run wild
such was her plan
won’t you stay here for a few days, aunt?
but my mother recently contracted a chill and has been out of sorts for two days
as my uncle and cousin are away, we mustn’t leave her here too long as this is a minor funeral
if there's poison in the dish, xifeng explained, the silver will show it
i’ll put it away at once
the heaviest responsibility devolved upon xifeng, who, unlike the others, had not a moment’s respite; but she was always so eager to shine, so anxious to give no one a handle against her, that she strove to carry out her many tasks as if they were nothing
if you both agree to be more careful in future, so that nobody loses face, i’ll ask master bao to take the blame
i was afraid she would scold me for over-salting it, and did not know what to do; but then she moved to the hack of the room, and while she was not looking i changed the bowls round
in that case let me settle the rhymes, said yingchun
the prefect had invited them to a meal
husband and wife fell out
leaving the others to chat, she strolled into the bamboo grove before the steps and concentrated on thinking, deaf and blind to everything going on around her
concubine chao must keep her place
by the way, i have something to ask you
there were still some famous actors then
let me find out for you
go on with your fun, and don’t stop eating or drinking,  she said when she had sat down on the rug
distressed to hear her talk like this, jia zheng and the others knelt down again and pleaded, do not take it so hard, madam!
your presence here contaminates this place and contaminates my door
until then i’ll fast, chant sutras and look after my mother while waiting for him to come and marry me, even if i have to wait a hundred years
mrs lin advised xiren and qingwen to brew him some puer tea
as for using his name, we’ve done that since he was a child, as well you know, on the old lady’s orders
i have seen the poem myself
look, cousin lin’s already left — she couldn’t last out any longer
don’t drag me in
it seems to me time to arrange a match for the young master
i did not ask for a single cent
i understand, he cried, clutching hold of them both
several maids dressed in red and green rose from the terrace and hurried to greet them with smiles
but in my seven or eight months here i have had nothing but a little meat and wine—not a copper have i seen
why did miss xue get the same as me and not miss lin?
too frightened to pick up his scissors, the boy scrambled to his feet to run outdoors
tell her i wanted to send her word that her husband is staying in sweet dew temple in wuhu county
it was you who told him that
suspicion poisoned her mind
so miss shi is frantic
as the proverb says, injustice will cry out
touched by her besotted master
there are reasons against it, replied mr ma gravely
now magistrate tang happened to be the son of a concubine, and when he read the statement he thought, laws are one thing, but the human factor has to be taken into account too
we shall have to hire some for the servants, but how can the ladies take hired mourning carriages?
his father-in-law tricked him, however, by pocketing half the sum and buying him some poor fields and a ramshackle cottage
whatever happens, do not let my aunt come over here!
what shall we do?
asked one of them
why do not you lend them a room for a couple of days?
senior licentiate yen invited them to take the seats of honour and, offering them wine, said, i should have invited you to my poor home, but i felt it was unworthy of you; and, since you have to go to the yamen presently, i wanted to avoid unnecessary delay
i seem to glimpse some vision;
so little by little these turned into gambling parties
the next loser was uncle xing, who when asked for a song said, i ca not sing
dear cousin, how fascinating you make it sound!
but servants of the throne like ourselves should be careful how we discuss affairs of state
all the villagers came and bowed to the ground to thank him
i worry too much about my children,  she sighed
now jia zhen and jia rong urged their elders to mount their chairs or horses
what else is there?
recently it has been rumoured that he has entered buddhist orders too
now that's settled, put in baoyu, let's go to paddy-sweet cottage
when i said i lost it outside, you wouldn’t have it, he reminded her
but some vestiges still behind the screen we discover
what else could fami
once outside, lai wang presented a packaged gratuity to the peasant family, whose womenfolk came to thank them
i didn’t want to invite some people, not others
when he had been served a meal, the old nurses, li gui and others strolled with him through the temple grounds till he was tired, when they took him back inside for another rest
are you escorted by the god of clouds,
they petitioned the emperor on his behal{ and the sovereign in his great goodness granted him an audience
it may be important
gaze up to catch the message from the phoenix, and sigh your answer to the azure air
not yet divined the fate in store for me,
she hurried across and pulled the nurse aside
i want to go back but have none of you with me
but as yu leant out from his cabin window to watch, he saw another man on the bank opposite throw himself into the river!
then he borrowed a few taels from tu shen−ching, packed his luggage, and crossed the river to travel to tienchang
baoyu clapped his hands
yuchuan tastes some lotus-leaf broth
aunt xue’s anger over the scene with jingui upset her liver, bringing on a pain in her left side
it had papered latticed windows on all four sides
what brings you here?
baoyu had to comply then
big as he is, he’s unique in never having had any proper schooling
she also allotted them the sanrie monthly allowances as were issued by the accountants' office to members of the rong mansion
it would be still more senseless to offend any of these girls
stay here for a couple of days, he said
when no one else was about but zijuan, he took her hand
when i was young we had a pavilion like this too at home, she said
my name is pao, and i am a native of nanking
thus we cannot arrest him
as you went in you saw three rooms with an eastern exposure
let's go back to your place, shall we?
he is for ever taking his wife to taverns
but with your cousin pan in this fix and your cousin ke away to sort things out, there was only baochai at home — and what could she do?
in agony, he bowed
pao wen−ching and his son wept as if their hearts would break
until it was revived by being watered every day with sweet dew by the attendant shen ying
if we did, people would complain
when his father died he shut himself up and dared not see a soul; so he was always being cheated, but had no one to complain to
but there’s another thing: people are bound to be worried by our absence
now, though life on a farm is hard, we have bought quite a few mu of land and sunk a well
surely not crude, one of his protégés remonstrated
we’ve been like brother and sister since we were small and played naughty tricks together
so this is where you’d run off to
the other made no answer, looking torn between grief and joy
xue pan stamped his foot frantically
when all were assembled and they had talked for a while, jia zheng's messenger arrived and presented his letter, announcing that the master would soon be home
a native of kwangtung, who was sentenced to exile at the border of shensi and was travelling there with his wife, had died here
if the master beats you to make you confess, your only way out is to refuse to admit it
into grand view garden
are you a friend, sir, of prefect li?
there was a mr niu pu−yi too, but unfortunately i only knew him by reputation: we never met
but now his wife had stepped forward to say: i am the only one who understands you
today she had been catching crickets there when she saw behind a rock a gaily embroidered sachet
besides, i thought, it’s sharing our masters’ good fortune that’s brought us this undreamed-of honour, so i don’t mind even if it bankrupts us
i’ve met this cousin before, he declared at the end of his scrutiny
lu has important business and asks master chu to go back
he entered, holding his breath, and saw the son of heaven in civilian costume on his splendid throne
then there is your cousin lin's
that’s the best of the lot
she kowtowed sullenly a few times, without offering tea or shoes,  then went straight back to her room
jia zheng saw his brother, sons and nephews next, and when the younger ones had paid their respects he informed them that the next morning he would sacrifice in the ancestral temple
i joined the expedition against green maple city, and, because i spent too much on reconstructing the city, have only just succeeded in making good the deficit
where would she have seen one?
not the kind you would get from perfumed pastilles, scent-balls or sachets
taking only eight runners in red and black caps, and with bailiff chai in attendance, he went straight down to the village
above its door was the inscription warm scented arbour,  and perfumed air struck warm on their cheeks as attendants lifted the red felt portiere
only as she stepped into the courtyard was she quietly apprised of this by some serving-women; but it was too late to retreat now that her arrival had been announced and lady wang had come out to meet her
though he's supposed to wail by the coffin, when the ladies come he spends all his time peeping at them round the curtain before it
chu−ko cannot recognize jelly−fish either
if you want to talk about character and foundation, tell me who has achieved the supreme primeval state?
i hope i get something good,  she thought while drawing a lot
you’d better write out the half you’ve done, tanchun
here he invited them to sit to enjoy the quiet beauty of the bamboos and boulders, the birds and the fish−pond; and presently prefect chu, who had changed into country dress, came out leaning on a stick to accompany them
so this romance was an empty dream, a chance encounter between an ill-fated young couple
now there were many girls, temperamentally different, in the garden; and as xifeng considered it unnecessary to open up another house for xiuyan, she decided the best thing would be to put her up with yingchun; for then if later lady xing heard that her niece was dissatisfied, no blame would attach to xifeng
each used a different approach
i know all about it
in the gold tray by it, on which zhao feiyan once danced, was the quince thrown in fun by an lushan at lady yang,number which had wounded her breast
i dropped a hint to the old lady, and i suspect she must have told xifeng
xifeng’s plans were already laid
my health is not up to it, replied tu
after reading them ca not you understand?
what do you think, sir?
all right, you go over first, but don’t let a word leak out
exclaimed the lady dowager
by now some maids had brought him a rinse-bowl and some strong tea to rinse his mouth
but zhang the taoist immediately objected, that's a charitable thought, master bao; but even if these things are of little value, some of them are well made
those who like to look at the moon from a height can come here; those who prefer to see its reflection in water can go there
he had to run away
just now, though, i had a dream
passes on any news to her
, 'waxed sandals come from far away,  and 'chants endless poems' describe visiting the chrysanthemum all right?
she treats my cousin like her own sister; in fact she’s even fonder of her than i am
when the waiter asked what dishes they wanted, ching ordered twelve cents' worth of assorted meat, one plate of pork crackling and one of bean sprouts
scores of torches were lit, and scores of devils leapt forward with iron prongs and spears
just think of your health
do not trouble, had already made himself scarce
it's my turn next, and if i ca not think of a line i will drink with you
get her another pair
for instance, there are profligates in the world who delight only in physical beauty, singing, dancing, endless merriment and constant rain-and-cloud games
you are old, said the girl
once home, the two brothers had to see to some business and entertain guests for several days
zijuan and her other maids pleaded hard with her
this reduced aunt xue once more to tears
it was weighed by the market balance, which gives thirteen and a half cents less to the tael than the official balance
may i trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me?
it’s a pity to give a lecher like him the insignia of the fifth or sixth rank
when i have recopied my poems, i will bring them to you with my notes on old texts and other miscellaneous writings for your criticism
then drink this cup of wine
daiyu could not suppress a laugh
now that she's coming to the capital you can feel much easier in your mind, madam
dozens of different suggestions were made, all of them stereotyped cliches; for jia zheng’s secretaries were well aware that he meant to test his son’s ability
he described the dressing-down they had been given
let us revert to jingui, who had sent baochan with refreshments to sound out xue ke
at sight of him, they exchanged knowing glances
what is your honourable name?
stop teasing, sister,  he begged
in fact, it’s bad for a patient to have to change her clothes four or five times a day and sit up to see the doctor
i’ve my own means of reckoning, though
kuang chaojen bowed and knelt down, but his brother raised him up and made him sit in the hall while he told him of the hard times they had had
lady wang suggested, go and entertain him first, sir
the old lady had these directions sent to jia lian with instructions to see to -this quickly
that's why you can keep my son-in-law in jail
it’s still early, said the duke, coming over to press him to stay
so far her home beyond the distant mountains
you must not take it so to heart
you are the one who started this
ouguan went off cheerfully with the other two
while they were talking, two priests came out from magnolia monastery to invite niu pu's companion to a meal, so he said goodbye and left
the others saw that after baoyu's revival his mind had cleared, and by taking medicine every day he steadily recovered his health
we must use the name baoyu a couple of hundred times a day; so it’s strange that you should choose this to pick fault
in the afternoon, you’ll expound texts and read essays
missed; but since master lian left there have been fine goings-on in the outer quarters!
the servants had been afraid that jia lian on his return would bring them to book, not grasping the situation; but to their surprise he knew more about it than they did
then we all burst out laughing and the old lady had to laugh too
here’s a granny asking for you
promising to do so, xifeng left
how old are you?
on no account look into the front — remember that!
yet already you are full of worldly desires
but leaping again, with all its might, it came within a foot of kuo
standing petrified baoyu asked, what is this place?
but recently she’s stopped coming here so often, and i have to go to school
give us a few more taels of silver, and tomorrow we shall act as hosts and invite over a hundred of your relatives to a feast
daiyu commented with a smile, you’ve no lack of ideas but the language lacks elegance, because you’re restricted by having read so few poems
but he's extremely timid
let’s play some drinking games,  baoyu proposed
having taken her seat granny liu picked up the chopsticks, but found them too awkward to manage
now as jia lian was on his way out a page had approached and reported, the elder master wants you, sir
the woman who admitted them reported, thieves were fighting here, and our young lady passed out for terror
the next morning he got up early, took the silver to the market and bought about a bushel of beans and several pigs which he kept in a sty
quite right, agreed li wan
but when you just ignore me and i ca not tell why, i am at my wits' end and do not know what to do
i’ve kept xiluan and sijie here,  she said
raising his eyes to her face he
these two volumes contain all the poems i have written, he said
striking his fist on the table, wang jen declared, the great thing about us scholars is our adherence to principles
the old lady, recollecting the zhangs’ proposal, reminded lady wang, you should go and let your husband know what we decided
we’ll look in again by and by
tanchun’s totally different from huan, whom nobody could like
where are you going?
' the servant brought in five bowls of noodles, and their host offered them vinegar, then heaped their bowls with cauliflower and meat
his wife’s sudden change for the better may mean that his luck will change too
she’s never to set foot inside the inner gate again
this clever imp had really kept some good lines up her sleeve
we are all good friends, not mere strangers who meet on the road, quoted hsiao
where did this come from?
in the tea−shop he saw a man in a tall hat, sapphire−blue gown and black shoes with white soles, drinking tea alone
xiren and sheyue reminded them, that year when the jade was lost, lin zhixiao consulted a fortune-teller; and after madam bao married into our house we told her that the character he came up with was the shang meaning reward
wang grovelled on the ground, kowtowing as fast as a pestle pounding onions; but that only made the two scholars more angry than ever
chou chin's travelling expenses and clothes were provided by chin
now our father is dead and we have too many mouths to feed — my brother and i ca not manage
you’re quite right, mother,  agreed xue pan
are you trying to hasten my death with your wailing?
let me have it
pinger agreed to try and hurried off, coming back before long with ha huan
he happens to be here, said chuang
this is no time for tea, declared chi wei−hsiao
but when he started to argue, yen's sons took the bolt of the door and a rolling−pin and beat him within an inch of his life
all i’m wondering, madam, is this: which of the two, miss baochai and miss lin, do you think baoyu prefers?
where their ways parted baochai said to daiyu:
you must call on him yourself
i am going to join in
we belong to different households
the lady dowager was feasted by hia she on the eleventh, by jia zhen on the twelfth, staying with them on each occasion for half a day, while time forbids us to enumerate all the feasts to which lady wang and xifeng were invited
now the sight of ouguan, to whom her sister had such an aversion, added fuel to the fire of the anger
when people are fated to die and the king of hell summons them, he sends small devils to fetch their spirits away
her heart beat wildly
and so having drunk enough, he went to bed
he at once sent men out of the city to tie up zhou rui and take him to the police to be cross-examined
tang called out his three battalions, as well as his two auxiliary forces
yingchun mentioned that at the time of her father's departure she had wanted to see him of{ but her husband had forbidden her
once home, unable to check her grief any longer, the old lady dismissed lady wang and sent baoyu to see off his uncle and cousin
too angry to speak, she fixed him with furious eyes until his cheeks were burning
granny liu didn’t know whether to sit or stand and longed for some hiding-place
meanwhile runners had swarmed in to guard all the doors, so that no one
i did not mean to kill you
with that profit you can buy more silk and get more from the pawnshop
baoyu made no reply, and lady wang was too worried to get a word out
anyone who sends word to the inner apartments will be killed on the spot
i am old and foolish, answered yu
what were the subjects?
they would be wasted on beggars, who would have no use for them
you won’t be able to give a thought to eating once you start reading it
when she had this trouble before, replied the bawd, she would not swallow so much as a drop of water
i will come back tomorrow to see how you are, she assured him
then baoyu exclaimed, i’m done for!
it ca not be helped: i must go
if you wanted these things why didn’t you tell me before?
how can you touch their fruit?
when he came back she had gone
why do such a thing?
it's up to you whether you marry again or not
the tutor sat in the highest seat, with tang erh opposite him, mr yao in the place of a guest, and yoo as host
put in li wan with a smile
a long poem with tricky rhymes had to be padded out a bit
yu wrote to his younger brother: what is this trouble?
but as she’s engaged it’s no use bringing it up
one of the gamesters made a note of this and after a few more throws remarked, i have lost quite a bit but wo not try to win it back now
they bundled the woman off
better put the blame on us here
i will do something more for you later
doctor wang and doctor zhang, who come so often, aren’t paid for each separate visit
knitting her sulky brows, her eyes flashing with anger beneath half-drooping lids, she pointed a finger at baoyu in accusal
the other, meant for baochai, in addition to writing-brushes, ink-tablets, inkstones, stationery, perfume-sachets, scented beads, fans, fan-sheaths, powder, rouge and pomade, had in it all sorts of toys from huqiu in soochow
go and check up to find out what’s really happened
that was just wild talk when i was too young to know any better
thereupon the old lady made lan sit beside her
order a good meal for her
just then a serving-woman came in to report that bao er’s wife had hanged herself
have you ever heard anything so funny?
what do you want a new one for?
did you really give him the cow for nothing?
they want us to move out, but he wo not give up the house; and so they take it out of me
xiren and sheyue, listening outside, compressed their lips to check their laughter
fit for a king,
'you are a smart fellow yet now you are broke, said the man
just listen to our advice once in a while
though simply an empty lament, they voice my distress
your worldly obligations have been fulfilled, they declared
no wonder i caught nothing, she said with a smile, then told suyun to adjust the hook and bait it with another worm on which a reed had been fixed
as an old hand here, surely you know this rule?
indeed, the fact that i brought a letter from shensi for your father sets us apart from the ordinary run of new acquaintances
so the wailing in the room grew louder and louder till the womenservants keeping watch outside hurried off in alarm to report this to the master
i ca not even suffer instead of her
baochai made servants open the cases and cabinets, but all were empty
that was smart of her,  said the lady dowager
recognizing jia lan's voice, baoyu stood up and called cheerfully, come in!
this is for your journey, fourth brother, he explained
you, madam, why everything's still topsy-turvy though today is the third day
they were laying into xiaohong in turn when an old nanny arrived with a message from xifeng
still clutching his cane, jia zhen made an effort to kneel to greet and thank his kinswomen
let him off and send him packing
it was xifeng with her persuasive tongue who succeeded in consoling them a little and urged them to go back
baoyu hastily put his hand over her mouth
she sent for ha zhen’s wife and daughter-in-law
all right then, but i can’t return this favour
so i ca not take the case to court
a man carried a fire-cracker as large as a house out of town to let it off, and thousands of people followed to watch
mother he saw that her daughter had darted up to baoyu, who had taken her hand
she never gets up before noon or lifts a finger in the house
and when niu yu−fu spoke up for wang they spat at him
if things go on like this we will have no peace either
we’ve not even been allowed to write poems, retorted tanchun
the girls and baoyu crowded round to read it and took it to mean that the jade could not be found quickly, but it would turn up some time when they were not looking
after a while he said, why should i worry about other people?
judging by what i have heard of him, he must have been a fine man; and had i known him i would certainly have asked for his instruction
first think about chronicle
yucun went to court to make his report, and by the time he returned to his office this incident had slipped his mind completely
then, taking up an old brush and dipping it well in the ink, he stared at the paper for some time, and wrote a line all in one breath
you seem to think the world of xiren, but who is she?
if baoyu’s uncle wants to offer congratulations, daiyu’s uncle’s family can celebrate her birthday too
why get so excited?
i liked it, retorted daiyu
zijuan clambered on to the kang beside her, the cup in her hand
it would be futile to reason with her now, seeing that she was so stubborn
he had better return to the garden and go out again the next day
in the end they were so devoted that when diguan died she nearly cried her heart out, and to this day she’s never forgotten her
fenger hastily stepped forward to put in, miss [in sent a maid with a note several times to invite her over, so finally she went
do i have to stay here?
but i hear you’ve another mistress who’s a widow, and several young ladies too
i have not been there
cousin bao's too reckless!
who else is she going to put in?
this soft-mist silk comes in four colours only: light blue, russet, pine-green and pink
his cheeks burning, he left the room
as soon as the party was seated the lady dowager proposed, let's begin with a few cups of wine
as regards both character and learning, the yu brothers had rarely been equalled
baochai knew from the poetry he had recited that morning that he
the girl's worry: she has no money to buy pomade
as baoyu followed her in, daiyu called from the inner room, zijuan, bring master bao in here
luting was truly an art the men of old cultivated to achieve tranquility and integrity
they took to having breakfast there and returning to their own quarters about noon
that reminds me, i’ve not fetched your pewter bed-warmer
one of these girls named lin, the fourth child of her family, was a surpassing beauty and expert too in military arts
presently a maid raised the portiere and two others carried out the table
i lie here getting worse and worse, and your uncle keeps trying to turn us out because he wants to repair these rooms
jia zheng summoned the twenty-one men-servants then working in the mansion to question them about the family's income and expenditure in the past
he seemed very upset when i explained all that had happened
give me back my husband!
how could she possibly know?
she really is a treasure
promise me this and i shall die in peace
re takes that talk about 'leaving the world of men' seriously, she reflectedno good will come of it in the long run
is your master well?
baoyu made no objection as baochai stepped forward to take the jade from his hand
the manager here has asked me to select a few essays, and i have to hurry to get them ready for the printers
the maids who saw her hastily scurried away
mrs zhang, weeping, testified, my husband, zhang da, lived in the southern suburbs and died eighteen years ago
ever since you ordered it, madam, xiren has been giving me one every evening
all the relatives had arrived and were discussing whom to appoint from the clan as his heir

maybe things were getting so out of hand he was afraid there might be some big scandal and therefore accused him of negligence to get him off more lightly
the abbot was most disconcerted
then, tired out, he walked stiffly back through clear stream gate to his lodgings, closed the door and went to bed
in that case,  said the young man
when the results were published, he had passed; and he bought more examination paper for the next test

you sleep in his room, sheyue
thinking this fellow was making fun of him, fan chin pretended not to hear, and walked forward with lowered head
it shows he's on the mend
the two girls went off then and sat down to sulk while xiren helped baoyu to bed
now maids came in to pour wine and bring in dishes, while outside the performance had started
have you ever seen me take any advantage of your family?
it’s our mistress who put us in charge here; so how dare they call us thieves?
this must have been done by a spark from a hand-stove,  she commented
in that case you can have mine, offered baoyu

the lady dowager, being in a good humour, took lady wang, aunt xue, baoyu and the girls to spend half a day in lai da’s garden

lending money is always a risky business
in the same way, xifeng has you
he’s in the right too, so why not make an indictment?
baochai shot daiyu a warning glance, making her regret her indiscretion; for in her eagerness to tease baoyu she had forgotten until it was too late how sensitive caiyun was

to cut short such wild talk xiren said she was tired and gave up answering him
knowing how delicate and hypersensitive she was, they all made allowances for her, overlooking any lack of hospitality and courtesy
such talk’s enough to set one’s teeth on edge
now i have only been away a couple of months, yet look at the chaos here!
it must be yang chih−chung!
your petition is rejected
i am delighted to meet you

that time we sent him wine, he said he could not drink; but just now i saw him going to see the mistress, red in the face and tipsy
if he has food, he can eat; if not, he’ll just have to go hungry

i have a guest
and as rong is not involved, should not he be released as well?
no need, rejoined xifeng
between ourselves, i do not mind telling you that although i have a few thousand taels of ready money, i do not want to spend it at the moment

all but lady xing and lady wang had risen from their seats and were standing by them, with their hands at their sides, to show respect
he left his eldest grandson jia rui in charge
asked her business, mrs lin pointed at the woman
you are right, of course, sir, replied li with a smile
my own servants have clocks and watches, because everything large or small must be done on time
how could she work herself into such a passion?
now that you’ve given me this lesson, auntie, do please do your best to settle this with the court
may i trouble you then to step into that tea−shop with me?
what a terrible tongue madam lian has!
then you wo not have to dance attendance on me
you have madam bao and sister xiren, both as pre~y as goddesses, yet you insist on fooling around with others
with your poor health you ought to look after yourself
the mistresses certainly have good judgement, she thought
please, please speak up for me, madam!
i decided to see if he was with miss [in, but i ran into some of her people who told me he wasn’t there either

we used to be colleagues in the same yamen
she spies on me as if i were a thief
after a few cups, feeling randy, he ordered the maids to clear away the wine and dishes, then closed the door to undress
she and cousin daiyu have the same birthday, that’s why she remembers it

it's too bad she was born into such a rich family, said one of the girls
now that you have been recommended, shaoching, you must do some good work for the government, to justify this generation of scholars
i don’t need her services here
tipsy snow-sprites over shattered rainbows have sped;
after all, to be honest, which of us can compare with her?
please give me that book then to take back with me, and i’ll read a few poems tonight
but on pay-day or when sweets are shared out, she’s always the first to come running
then mingyan brought round his horse, and they left by the back gate
do not worry, he replied
she’ll be married next year
the two men laughed and stood up

this letter, far from angering xifeng, amused her
the jade in the box hopes to fetch a good price,
this was a stroke of luck!
i am afraid the young fellow knows too much and is going to bad places

as pan handed over two hundred coppers as largesse, the door which had been closed at the bridegroom's arrival was opened and old mr cheng came out; and when he and his prospective son−in−law recognized each other as fellow passengers on the same boat some years before, they felt this marriage must have been predestined
the emperor sighed, then ordered the prime minister to decree: permission is hereby granted chuang shao−kuang to return home
you all think me silly,  she told him, shedding tears
whenever you get wind of any perks of handouts to one of the stewards’ wives, you dash off like dogs with wagging tails to announce it
pin−niang spread her scarlet handkerchief on chen's knee

though xiaohong did not want to drop the matter, neither did she want to arouse the suspicions of others by questioning the young man

as wu shu saw him out, one of the college servants came rushing up
i don’t have to name him
after this yuanyang seldom went to the garden after dark; and reflecting that if even the garden was the scene of such strange carryings-on, other places must be still worse, she went nowhere else either if she could avoid it
incense is burned on the ground
thou canst not one by one the crowd persuade,
what a pity chi wei−hsiao is not here!
he retorted with a grin

so now his memory has come back again
and that would be too bad
ma chun−shang went in

why does the jinx have to be found here?
what did your clan say, cousin?
he listened for some time
whatever she says goes, and no one dares stop her

li wan and the others read them
but your family has never thrown its weight about like that in the past
on that date we can all meet here
reasoning like this, he felt as jubilant as if seeing daiyu herself

what shall i do?
daiyu rose at once to go
she was sipping her wine to keep him company when jia lian’s old wet-nurse nanny zhao came in
aunt li nodded and jia lan went off with the letter to find baoyu

daiyu lay peacefully with closed eyes, snugly wrapped in an apricot-red silk quilt, while xiangyun’s black hair had tumbled all over the pillow, her quilt barely reached her shoulders, and she had flung one white arm adorned with two gold bracelets outside the covers

what a barrier there is between wealth and poverty
today after lunch she did some reading but soon became bored with the book; then she did a little needlework with zijuan and xueyan, but found this even more tedious
it's late now; you would better go back
li wan interposed at this point, i’ll go and see about getting some wine heated for you
now the days are so long, i was afraid you might alt be bored while i was out and go to bed after your meal, which might make you fall ill, i’m glad you found a way to amuse yourselves
but not daring to say so outright, she just tried to comfort her

what you would just said was not right, ni er chuckled
i’ve been trying hard to console her, but it’s no use
every evening he continued to read poems in the temple
is it snowing outside?
yen put on a scholar's cap, a blue gown and red silk sash, while concubine chao dressed herself in crimson and put a gold chaplet on her head

the company roared with laughter
she chased after him regardless, expostulating, last time you lost the jade it nearly cost me my life!

the runner laid hold of him
she giggled, i was kind enough to keep this between ourselves, yet you start manhandling me
i want you to live in harmony as a happy family, he told them
apart from my clothes and bedding i have nothing but a casket with a few old books in it, said wang hui
but it would not be right for us to stay here and wait while he sends a man all that way to fetch us

when jia lian saw how things were, he was very pleased with second sister’s virtuous conduct
i’ve had insomnia a long time now,  daiyu sighed
all noble ladies come from the realm of love and retribution
smiling, xifeng returned her greeting and hand in hand they entered the house, where xifeng took the seat of honour while second sister ordered her maid to bring a cushion, then knelt to pay her respects
second sister ordered wine and food to be prepared
she had heard a great deal from her mother about the magnificence of her grandmother’s home; and during the last few days she had been impressed by the food, costumes and behaviour of the relatively low-ranking attendants escorting her

his aunt promptly sent for the best wine in the house
yen's cheeks as he pointed to a chest and said, yesterday the pawnshop sent three hundred taels of interest over

but you may fall ill if you can’t write good poems

your third sister’s rather smart,  remarked daiyu
what do you mean?
lady wang opened the packets but could not recall what they were, and there was no ginseng among them
you would better give your money to the pimp at feng family lane in yicheng!
but to her surprise, upsetting her even more, he simply sighed, how sublime!
as they went out she said to mrs wang, i have a suggestion, if you agree to it, and that is to restrict the search to our own family
someone told me he was in chiangnan, so i have been there three times
she turned to baoyu
he put these on the counter and they started drinking
but the doctor would not tell me
when xiren heard knocking at the gate, she got up at once and sent to ask what was so pressing
because he and daiyu both lived in the lady dowager’s quarters he was closer to her than to the other girls, and being closer had grown more intimate; but precisely because of this he sometimes offended her by being too demanding and thoughtless
i don’t want them
so eat early and go and rest

there was no fixed standard of scholarship, however
she went to the bridal chamber where wuer was setting out candles
but you must not let him know i put you up to this
not that her mother pays any attention, and her father does nothing either, so poor yingchun's worse off now than one of our third-grade maids
she then thought the whole business over carefully once more, and hit on a cunning plan to kill several birds with one stone, working out the safest measures to achieve this
of course, if your tastes are simple you can have less
i don’t know, ma’am
he travelled all day, stopping only to refresh himself when he was hungry or thirsty, staying in inns at night, and he had been three days on the way when a caravan of pack-horses came towards him escorted by a dozen or so men on horseback
xiren asked where they were taking the hamper and what was in it
qingwen was wasting away, having touched no food for four or five days; but now with dishevelled hair she was dragged from the kang and two women carried her off
if you want to study quietly, sheyue said, who’d dream of disturbing you?
the next instant she started at a loud dong like the sound of a bronze bell or copper chimes repeated eight or nine times
it’s a mystery to me the way things turn out
have you written the letter yet?
aunt xue was already upset on this score
you must explain more clearly
if he had, heaven knows how wildly he’d carry on!
she insisted i come to see if you would made it up
instead of answering, she stepped forward and threw the powder in fangguan’s face
he sighed appreciatively, this is certainly unexpected
with that he tucked the stone into his sleeve and hurried off with the taoist
i shall take part too
when the old man went to the yamen, yoo sent a servant to find tang san

bonzes chanting sutras burned incense, sacrificed to the hungry ghosts and intoned the water penitential while thirteen young nuns in red slippers and embroidered robes recited incantations before the coffin to lead the soul on its way
why did not you put more on before bringing my tea?
why ask me that?
as there was insufficient room on the kang, xiaoyan and sier set two chairs beside it
i’ll get the blame if you’re seen leaving, said jia qiang
then, having taken his leave of the lady dowager, he went over to the other mansion
they were all wearing brand−new headdresses and jackets
on that day all the neighbours brought congratulatory gifts, even kuei contributing his share, so anxious was he now to keep in with them
dairu had crossed out child and substituted at fifteen
under the impression that daiyu was unconscious, and as zijuan was away, xueyan took daishu’s hand and asked her in a low voice, was it true what you told me the other day about some mr wang proposing a match for our master bao?
and she sent messengers posthaste to take the news
seating herself on the steps leading to the small courtyard, she made the girl kneel down
i can truly never repay her tremendous kindness
what were you doing?
that nephew of hers was an odd fellow too
i come from south of the yangzi, but my parents are dead and i’m all on my own, with no brothers; so i have to put up in my grandmother’s house

but before the ropes could be pulled another crack was heard, and the ankle−screws broke once more
lady wang had taken baoyu on her lap
his anecdotes on painting when he described the frescoes zhang sengyou painted in a monastery

indicating jia lian, the young man said, i have come to have a word with second uncle

crafty xifeng kills her rival
they look so refined one would expect them to be understanding, but they’re stupid fools with no insight at all into other people’s hearts
and your commanding presence—so unlike mr chih's mature dignity—struck awe into my heart
baoqin, standing up too, continued:
jumping to one side, he whirled round to confront a man with a club; and as this fellow lunged at him, hsiao shot up a foot to send him sprawling
one’s too greasy, the other too sweet,  complained the old lady
yes, replied mr wei
li wan assented and did so, after first calling for water to wash her hands
all he could do was to wait

as they skirted the back of a rockery, baochai inquired:
ting−hsi dared say no more, but asked kuei to go with him to call on the go−betweens
the other day a man came from my district and told me that my father was ill at home; and i am miserable because i do not know whether he is alive or dead
is this the place for you to bawl abuse?
you minx, you don’t deserve such luck, madam you teased
go on, you little bitch,  chuckled her mother
so one of the small girls went to ask her sister to speak to old mrs fei
why spank me for something my mother said?
i have already made one
to return to daiyu
to live quietly and contentedly in a green plot in the city as you do, uncle, is as good as being an immortal!
when you see the old lady, please give her my respects and tell her i’m a bit poorly, but it’s nothing serious she’s not to worry
have bao er and that fellow he san tied up
that would do just as welt
will take their natural course', he said
you came here to have a good time
it must be zijuan, she thought with relief
ni er's spirits rose again
that should take us over the whole grounds
if she doesn’t, no harm will be done as no one else will know
two imperial eunuchs have come, asking to see your lordships, he announced
he and the girls stayed to dine with the old lady, after which they dispersed, aunt xue staying on to sleep in the old lady’s annex
from that hour baoyu treated xiren with special consideration and she served him even more faithfully than before
and where is your honourable yamen?
if this food is poison, ours is pure arsenic
i am sorry to have put you and my cousin to such trouble
they can’t do a thing if i withhold the tally
how silly can you get?
even more embarrassed than earlier on with daiyu, he turned away to talk to the others
since this made it out of the question to wait any longer, yucun went through a passage to the side gate and left
are you my uncle chuang cho−chiang?
our examinations are a great affair of state, and since we were busy on state business, even if we had to neglect our own relatives we need feel no compunction
that’s apart from what else they filch
in which mrs wang quarrels with her husband, and ni ting−chu finds his brother big foot went home to report that mrs wang was willing, and shen tien−fu announced this to kuei when he arrived the next morning for news

after reading the title he looked up thoughtfully to ask baoyu, have you studied mencius already?
what a coincidence, meeting you here
consoled by these reflections, she forgot the fatigues of the day and started reading again, till zijuan who was worn out urged her to sleep
he is the third son of the former minister hu, and his name is hu chen
after i was twenty i learned how to be a secretary, and i have worked in a number of yamens

she shook herself and changed into a lovely girl with a most bewitching face
is anything there that shouldn’t be?
lou feng agreed with him
it was supported by those with official positions, who contributed according to the size of their stipends, and an elderly man of good reputation in the clan was elected to take charge of the boys’ instruction
by now xichun was feeling more wretched than ever
why has not he come to welcome mr chou?
lady xing insisted that she stay for the evening meal
just give him jia yucun's name, and tell him what you want of him
admittedly, her two messages were not long, but she spoke to the point
don’t let anyone give her the wrong medicine, though
how did we come to take on someone so stupid?
the lady dowager turned to tell xifeng, go and fetch xiangyun, baochai, baoqin and daiyu, and ask tanchun to come with them

it's nearly time for the examination and your grandfather has it very much on his mind
how old are you?
meanwhile lady wang and the others had finished their melons, and after some further talk the party broke up, the girls returning to the garden
with the capital so far from your honourable district!
you have reason to worry, madam
it was so amusing that i stayed to watch
i am overjoyed at this encounter here!
it must be lord zhen’s fault

when your mother died i was far away in peking, and could not come back to mourn for her in person
and one night she said: all i pray for now is that buddha will take me away in your place and let you get well
we’ve just got her to stop crying
if nothing had happened, well and good; as it is, high and low alike we are all in trouble so who can get you off?
do not be in such a hurry!
the latter assented but waited till the old lady had washed her hands, rinsed her mouth and left the table to chat with lady wang
if you can’t make her drink,  chuckled the old lady, i’ll go out presently and toast her myself
his rooms were filled with the pungent scent of herbs and qingwen was lying all alone on the kang, her face flushed with fever, her forehead hot to his touch
after a short rest, however, he asked abruptly, is not there someone missing?
still, you’re in too much of a hurry to give her a job
from joy and grief alike your heart was free;
you’re only joking, cousin,  said xiangyun, but some people are really jealous
xiren remarked, as your parents aren’t on the spot, they must have spoken to your sister-in law
my brother should never have agreed to that match
we know what’s in your heart
there should not be any difficulty
xifeng told hongyu, take those things and see master yun out
do you work here?
miaoyu would not drink out of any cups but her own; however, before long her maid brought over her things and xichun herself made the tea
if there’s anything of use to you, you can have it; and if you’ll make out a list of what’s still missing, i’ll send people to buy it
when i stopped him he was not his usual self, the rough way he pushed and shoved me without any feeling at all; and later he had less patience with madam bao and not the least feeling for the other girls either, as if he would awoken to the truth
when you two fall out, why put the blame on me?
the salt merchant will have nothing so good to offer me!
that was why he gave her the name li wan and the courtesy name gongcai
i do not know how you feel about it
i did not go, said wang teh with a frown
and here is the song to summon her spirit:
thanks to the imperial favour and the virtue of our ancestors, your noble highness embodies the finest essences of nature and the accumulated merit of our forbears — such fortune has attended my wife and myself
it's nothing like in the old days
jia rong, knowing his game, rejoined, if you’ve taken such a fancy to her, uncle, i’ll act as your go-between to make her your secondary wife
she had to send xue ke to smooth matters over with the county court
why, even a number of tigers, wolves, snakes and insects have now entered nirvana
nowadays we have these disgraceful scenes — not like a respectable family, she said
we can only hope that from now on he will stick to the right path and never be influenced again by those evil spirits!
what a poor opinion you have of other people!
by the afternoon, however, more relatives and friends arrived, entailing even more work, and she could not see to everything at once
we have no scholar there by that name
then he reported the matter to lady wang, and obtained permission to leave the corpse for five days in pear fragrance court before its removal to iron threshold temple
it’s nothing but a cold, said the doctor
why should miss lin be angry?
we’re all women, only a bit different in status, so i can’t think why anyone should be so cruel
the lady dowager and the rest sat at tables on either side, while madam you, li wan and xifeng passed round dishes and poured the wine
i am worried too by his illness
the old lady isn’t here to keep an eye on him today~~
all you know is how to enjoy yourself
when she passed on her instructions, baochai, baoqin, daiyu, tanchun and xiangyun all went with her to the garden where they were introduced and paid their respects
if it's not, we will let whoever it is get a soaking
but of them all xue pan was the most frantic, being afraid that in the crush his mother might be knocked over, baochai stared at, or xiangling exposed to indignities -- for he knew what libertines jia zhen and the rest were
li wan, baoyu and the rest, on receiving these presents, tipped the messengers and told them that they would thank baochai when next they saw her
xifeng had no choice but to do as she was told
watchful pinger quickly followed her and took her arm
baoyu reckoned on his fingers
daliao answered with a smile, why, madam, with your broad knowledge of past and present, have not you heard the story of how wang xifeng of the han dynasty found an official post?
say what you have to say, but keep your hands to yourself
that fortune−telling is a low profession goes without saying; but even teaching and secretarial work are not proper careers

if we asked caiyun in confidence and she owned up, yuchuan could stop worrying and everybody would forget about it
and doubting the use of this, aunt xue prevailed on xifeng to send jia lian with several thousand taels to buy off the magistrate, while xue ke at the same time squared the others involved
that’s a good child too
let me recite you a verse, sir
after one beat on the gong the music started
jia zheng described the raid to him and asked him to make inquiries

as lady wang raised no objection, the serving-woman brought in granny liu and greetings were exchanged
we have two types of miaos — the wild and the tame, said the prefect
as they were speaking, servants brought in tea; and after the tea mr hu stood up and invited them into the library
there was nothing the magistrate could do but send the feast to the servant's quarters and ask his stewards to eat with the actor
do not be in such a hurry, objected li wan
but not too much salt has been lost, and your honour has already punished the helmsman, so that he will be more careful in future
i’d better raise a rumpus in miss lin’s place instead
jia yucun had no choice but to say goodbye to the priest and leave the temple
puzzled to find them all with red eyes, granny liu presently asked, what's wrong?
we’re a happy family of kith and kin i must say, all like game-cocks fighting to finish each other off
when nothing can be called a test
clouds from the islands make a haze over the ocean,
it did not matter your asking me to take in the tea — you could not do anything else
what do you want incense for?
it’s made two hundred and twenty ingots in all

well, it's not often they spend their money on me
leading a hard life, uninfluenced by the imperial examinations, they retained their sterling qualities
she told the two young maids to accompany him
how is it my mother knows all the faults of the other girls but not those of you, sheyue and qiuwen?
she asked what they were
she sneezed so violently, five or six times in succession, that her nose and eyes started to run
we have some families of tribesmen here  just say i’m from one of those
yinger stepped forward to report, when i saw master bao going out i told sister xiren to go with him

in that way he was just able to make ends meet

i am not one to blab -- if i were, they would be involved in plenty of murder cases!
then baochai did not insist, and they tried for a while to guess the answers, but with no success
the attendants were afraid to go near her

i am sure master bao will come back
i’m just giving her part of some that was given to me,  she explained
lady wang was speechless, in tears
this talk reached the ears of ni er's wife and daughter, who waited in vain that night for him to come home
who would have known it’s her turn next to die?
four maids who were waiting knelt down upon both knees
how do you come to be here, uncle?
think over what you said
afraid his pig-headedness would lead to trouble, the others hastily put in, you understand everything else so well, why ask about the term natural’?
his mother saw from the dazed look on his face that he had something on his mind
they could not escape hsiao's catapult, however
everyone speaks of miss baochai’s good manners and generosity,  she gushed, and sure enough here’s an example today
we must not hold them up; so i will say goodbye
so she and zhou rui's wife set out with granny lin for the lady dowager's quarters
it upsets you to see how fond i am of your cousin, but i love you even more if you only knew it
the heartless meet with certain retribution
my dear cousin, you are being touchy instead if you talk like that, said xiangyun
selected essays have a short vogue only, said the shopkeeper
can you really be so vulgar as not even to tell the difference?

the wine in his left hand, he took aim with the sword in his right above the old man's crown
jia lian grabbed his arm protesting, there are ladies inside; how can you charge in so wildly?
and mr mei said,  amy own name seems to be an auspicious one, so i will give it to him and hope that he will turn out like me
why does their love come to nothing?
but no more of this
i’ll take care of him
what do you want of me?
dark tradesigns flutter above the wineshops, and red charcoal glows in the tea−house stoves, while men and women stream by, on pleasure bent, to throng the countless taverns and music halls
inevitably, this over-indulgence had made her like the brigand dao zhi of old: she had as high an opinion of herself as if she were a goddess, and treated others like dirt
now that things had come to such a pass, xueyan could not but grieve for daiyu, though she dared not show her feelings to the old lady and xifeng
fan was taken ill in front of my temple just after he passed the examination, but i was out that day and could not do anything for him

i really can’t bring myself to do such a thing
your first and second young ladies’ families are on close terms with ours
pray allow me to reflect carefully before submitting a memorial

the butcher went on cursing at full blast, till fan chin's head spun
this was a huge lake, almost as large as the west lake in hangchow
he bowed his way to his chair, then left
she caught hold of the girl’s sleeve to drag her off
yun, the son of fifth sister-in-law who lives in west lane, has come several times begging me to find him a job, and i promised him i would if he would wait
as the old woman rose to leave
i hope you will consider doing good as its own reward, and not take offence at my lack of courtesy
you’d feel the same if you heard someone in my place complaining about me
transmigration has always been considered a mystery, declared magistrate hsiang
not only for my sake either
zijuan laughingly fetched the tea leaves and told one of the younger maids to make tea
that’s why, in front of the master, i said it was xiangling
the old lady, lady xing and lady wang immediately asked what had happened
what business have you here?
i am lu hsin−hou of hukuang
he used to be my disciple, and now that he has become a great official he has sent these men to invite me to become the abbot of pao kuo monastery in the capital
i heard just now, sir, said pao, that charges are being brought against magistrate hsiang of antung county
who are you, you lawless brigand?
jia zheng entrusted all three to the care of
to know what followed, turn to the next chapter
some mr wang was the go-between—he’s related to the east mansion; so without making further inquiries they accepted out of hand
i fail to understand your attitude, sir
i am fortunate to have met you who can certainly edify me
the chicken and pork simmering in one pan set his mouth watering; and he saw a pan of good rice, too, and a bottle of wine
who am i to be cross?
from spring till summer?
tell the mistress that, he cut in halfway
the master sends you his respects, sir, he said to kuang
jia zheng found the whole privy council as well as the princes assembled in the palace
as he was speaking, he fastened up his hair and asked the apothecary for a basin of water to wash his face, while one of the neighbours found his shoe and helped him put it on
they’re doing it in their own good time
his mother could surely have seen her daughter by herself
if you fix this up, i’ll make it worth your while  how’s that?
to know the reason for this summons, read the next chapter
chinese feudalism, the development of which had long been retarded, was in a state of decline
so it was just one of your tricks
and in he walked, in a large hat of plaited bamboo leaves and a coir cape
i gave you a lot of trouble yesterday,  declared baoyu
do you know mr tu too, nephew?
the old lady ordered sheyue to send to fetch him
when they entered the courtyard they heard her talking with a man
thank goodness it was miss baochai and not miss lin -- she  would have made a fearful scene, weeping and sobbing
i am so glad you have come!
she dressed rather conspicuously too
where have you been all this time?
then xifeng, having washed her face, went back to wait on the lady dowager
i do not ask anything else — just let him show me the marriage certificate signed by my father, and i will say no more!
really i should drink a few cups with you, but i have some very urgent business today to report to my father
by now jia lian was calling pinger from the door of the hall, and before she could go to meet him he stepped through her doorway
thinking daiyu had been scolding him again, xueyan had to go back to bamboo lodge where she gave zijuan the ginseng, as their mistress was still asleep
she quietly told baochai, 'the talking-to you gave him did the trick after all, madam
it’s all that jia yun’s fault!
he dropped her hand then and told her, she said to me, 'if i would known i was going to get a bad name, i would have committed myself
jia lian agreed and withdrew to order a carriage for hupo and the maids
some outstanding examples are the juniper tree before confucius’ temple and the yarrow before his tomb, as well as the cypress before zhuge liang’s temple and the pine before yue fei’s tomb
i only beg your highnesses to be lenient to my uncle who knew nothing about this
she presented some brushes and stationery to baochai, yingchun, baoyu and others
none but admires her talents and her skill;
who could have imagined such a stroke of luck?
and what i like about you is that you are the most lustful man ever to have lived in this world since time immemorial
i dared not, sir
tang san called one day when yoo had nothing to do
if i’d known, i should never have struck her  not even if some devil were forcing my hand
when the results were published, chou chin had passed with distinction, and all the merchants were delighted
and mrs you, to be easy in her mind, had to bring her two unmarried daughters with her
and when the lips are gone the teeth will feel the cold
let's have the dice
but we have brought that stupid object back with us
magistrate fang of our county has treated you very well
he seized this chance to add: as the proverb says
baoyu were to come back how happy we all should be!
this set xiangyun worrying
aunt huang immediately flew into a passion
he was dazzled by the glittering gold and emerald and the elegance of all the furnishings, but could see no sign of baoyu
no, it's usually kept shut, they answered
but to bring out its splendour once it is displayed we must write poems about it; so six is writing about the chrysanthemum
the author's condemnation of his negative characters cannot be considered as personal attacks
she called me silly, said i was talking nonsense, and i dared not argue with her
not until feng ziying came out did he let them go
i needn’t name any names
qiaojie turned to look at him, then started crying again
as for his sister’s wedding, pan says your decision was a good one, and rushing it through will save a good deal of money
he started sobbing too
master bao, not being used to this heat, might be over-powered by the stench
how do you know he will suffer in the next world?
at sight of these nine spirits, he raised his magic staff and threatened to beat them
the older you grow the more outspoken you get
they came in now to greet the scholars, and chih heng−shan gave the boys the vermilion flutes and pheasant feathers for their dance
yen told the nurse to bring in his son, and threw a coarse linen cloth over the child's shoulders as a sign of mourning, the coffin had been ready for some time
i was just old enough then to remember things
gold is like iron to them
often lost in thought, he did not know what to do
daiyu could only pretend not to have heard
as it was nearing sunset, she had to find yuanyang and tell her which of the old lady's things she wanted
all eyes were fixed on mr
are you in low spirits, madam?
is your other name yu−huei, by any chance?, he asked
there’s no need to discuss it, expostulated baoyu
otherwise, in less than a year you will have spent all your family's money and made those above and below resent you too
then with a smile to aunt xue the old lady said, let's go
the more he thought about it, the worse his hand hurt, and he asked the apothecary to give him some ointment for it
and there’s something even more amazing
if he is a successful candidate, it will help to atone for our faults
when yu yu−ta reached wuwei, the district magistrate, truly mindful of old friendship, entertained him for several days
li wan agreed, yes, since ancient times many men have given up rank and wealth to achieve buddhahood and become immortals
shouted niu, beside himself with anger
all right, we wo not have them pulled out
i hope you’ll guess them
he then paced up and down outside alone
he prepared a farewell feast, and produced over a dozen taels of silver, then hired a sedan−chair and saw wang off to huichow
and now that i’m tipsy, unless i’m very careful, i may smash this porcelain cup
i love meddling in other people’s affairs,  said the lady dowager
no matter how thick a sheet of ice, a piwan can shatter it with one roar
lady wang pointed out the place
collect my books and bring round my horse
did you write this?
why should you, who are usually so good to me, be so hard on me today just because of pinger?
the others were wondering what she meant when xiren picked up the slip for all to see
since wu comprised the modern provinces of kiangsu and chekiang, it was fitting that a native of chekiang should act as master of sacrifice
accordingly baochai ordered a serving-woman, go and ask my brother to get us several crates of big crabs like those we had the other day
sheer went straight to find xiangling
they could not agree on their diagnosis
when she and her mother got back, jia huan and jia cong had just called to see baoyu
how would that be?
she ordered the stewards to conduct the eunuchs to where refreshments were waiting
i am not making this up you heard her for yourself in front of alpinia park
both stories seemed likely and xiren was convinced
asked chi tien−yi, very pleased
no wonder it tastes so good, cooked with a dozen chickens
in that case, do invite them over,  urged the dowager princess
we shall thank you again when that man of mine comes out
xiuyan, after bowing and praying on her instructions, got up to help hold the planchette
by the afternoon when there was no sign of them, she, li wan and baochai sent servants out to make inquiries, but they did not come back, having no news
the men ignored her for a while, but finally one of them said, wait over there by that corner
it would simply pour oil on the flames
when shall i be able to go?
the top compartment was full of brushes and sticks of ink, fans, incense slabs, multi-coloured pouches, sashes and the like
baoyu paid his respects to aunt xue and greeted baoqin but looked in vain for baochai and xiuyan
it’s only the tenth month, and this is the first fall of snow this winter,  rejoined the old lady
after the steward's return the news spread like wildfire that concubine zhao had been tortured to death by the king of hell because she had plotted murder
how come then that when i was away for a few days and you were laid up, practically at death’s door, you mended that cape for him with no thought of your health?
when you go in, auntie, do filch a few apricots for me
xifeng told fenger: bring that set of ten cups carved out of bamboo root on the bookshelf in the inner room
out with the truth!
if i’m not in earnest may i drop dead!
if you would spoken before, it could have been fixed up some time ago
at once she recoiled a few steps
i shall probably be here for some years, so i have taken another wife
so do stop drinking cold wine
if she weren’t quite incapable of any exertion, i know she’d have made an effort to be here today, observed xifeng
what’s been keeping you all this time?
have you come from miss xing’s place?
he was marveling, too, that the voice carried so clearly right into the house
i was on my way to ask cousin daiyu when luckily i met you
the other beast flew into a rage, and thrust out one paw to knock off the tiger's head, felling it to the ground
they’re lucky to be here at all, able to watch and eat free of charge, but i won’t let them choose any items
approved li wan too
then chin tung−ya, followed by lu hua−shih, entered the hall
leave that to me, said feng
ting−hsi asked a diviner to find a suitable site for the grave and to choose a day for the burial; but there was no one to write an inscription for the pall
my innocence is proof against abuse
riding on, xue pan observed that the houses now were few and far between
as long as baoyu lives, i shall always be his whipping-boy
we will get somebody to keep you company, to pour you tea during the night
the next year rebels rampaged east of the mountains,
and she was so dazzled by everything in the room that her head began to swim
we were trying to amuse the old lady, why should i be cross?
then, wailing loudly, she tried to climb on the wooden roof of the bed, and began to sing snatches of opera
as she entered this temporary palace, she saw torches in the courtyard flaring to the sky, powdered incense strewing the ground, flaming trees, jasper flowers, gilded windows and jade balustrades, to say nothing of screens as fine as the shrimp’s antennae, carpets of otter-skin, musk burning in tripods, and fans made from pheasant plumage
he left his uncle's house in a temper and was trudging home with lowered head, fuming over such shabby treatment, when he bumped into a drunkard
the old lady chortled, as the proverb says: even a clever wife can’t make congee without rice
mind you blow gently though
do you appreciate them better now?
then he passed the palace examination and was appointed a magistrate, after which he married one of the zhen family’s maids — his present wife is his second
go back and tell your master that
when the proofs are out and when the book is published i will invite you again, he said
one book on ceremony, one on etymology, and one on country etiquette
so what could i do?
every day they either fight or squabble, and there’ve even been several cases of gambling and theft
these may not be divulged in advance to you with your human eyes and mortal frame
strictly speaking, it’s not my job to announce visitors
it will be livelier having it together
i wanted my fortune told
such was the depth to which the people of wuho had sunk
mind you don’t hurt your hand, madam,  urged pinger
but who will bury mc when dead i lie?
exclaimed granny liu in surprise
to prevent gossip she’s ordered you to ignore me, but here you come seeking me out
he had a lean, sallow face and sparse moustache and, because he was a short−sighted fellow and absorbed in his reading, he did not see kuang chao−jen come in; but when the latter came over and greeted him, he stood up and returned the greeting
those who know us say: boys will be boys
wouldn’t that be the same?
he burst out weeping
but when second master carried on like that outside you ought to have told me about it earlier
i’ve thrown the wrong one!
whatever happens, don’t just slip away
why put up with such bad treatment from her husband?
luckily she was challenged by no one on her way to happy red court
where are you going?
he then cautioned xue pan, mind you don’t tell the family
this is the best!
formerly a small alley had separated the two houses, but since this was private property and not a public thoroughfare the grounds of both could now be thrown into one
you must go home at once to see to qiaojie
aunt xue declared, i’m too old to mix in your crowd, and i feel very boxed up here too, i’d rather lie down in comfort in the council hall
more cheerful now, the old lady told yuanyang to get out a hundred taels and order the servants to prepare two days' feasts, starting from the next day
especially as the family of your betrothed isn’t as well off as before
jingui makes a scene and baochai
when you heard i was here, why didn’t you come out?
they’d never heard of it and said instead i was cheating, so we started squabbling and i’ve spolit my new skirt
rather sheepishly, she hastily sat up, straightened her clothes and went back with the others to red fragrance farm
even so,  proposed pinger, we must call those two trouble-makers caiyun and yuchuan over, and get them to agree to this arrangement
leave it to me
but if she goes home to rest i’ll have nobody here, as xiren’s away just now
then baoyu, instead of going out, ordered the doctor to be sent for at once
i wo not deceive you
take this to show your uncle bao, then give it back to your mother
but pinger slipped from his grasp and ran out of the room, leaving him doubled up in frustration
but you mustn’t wear yourself out
let’s get on with burying the flowers
from now on i shall have to address you as master,  not as sister’ any more
all men must die
but though he knew the real reason for her distress he refrained from speaking of it, for fear of making her feel worse
so you are the famous chekiang editor, said feng
it is not fair i would not have begrudged xiren ten times as much either--she deserves it
i can’t eat anything or drink much either, so i’ll leave my place to them and that will suit everybody
jia zhen was not in good health himself at this time and, being weighed down with grief, he limped in with a cane
the body is a bodhi tree, the mind a mirror clear;
there was nobody about, nothing but a few trees, and the smoke from some distant cottages where supper was being cooked rose up, a vivid blue, straight to the clouds
why should i trouble my head over such matters?
don’t go to sleep just yet, you two,  she said
even if he does not pay us back, we merchants always fritter away a few taels one way or another, and this is in a good cause
but there's not a moment to lose: you will have to get busy at once, sir
although our aim is to economize and make a profit, we mustn’t be too stingy either
she’s better, answered xifeng, who had an aversion to both him and concubine zhao
your remark the other day about good fortune and bad has been on my mind ever since, he said
kuang was too worried that night to sleep
let them bring me three thousand taels and i’ll see to this for them
because your daughter was always making trouble, she asked xiangling to keep her company and they slept in the same room
you must have a simple meal with us; and mr wu is writing a poem for you
but master bao wanted to send something today to miss shi in the house of the young marquis
the gate was closed but not yet locked
i’ve searched even the young lady’s person
kuang chao−jen was annoyed
the garrison commander of the capital reported: xue pan, a native of jinling, while travelling through taiping county put up in li family hostel
this would mean fewer men without wives, and would help to strengthen general morality
how can one take everything so seriously?
finally she voiced her own fear of punishment, all but going down on her knees, she was so frantic
the other one is xiren
one day after drinking a few cups alone jingui, lying on the kang, decided to work off her spleen on baochan
by law you should be punished, but in view of your brotherly concern i shall pardon you
do not you know that one ancient sage taught that we 'should not lose the heart of a child?
in a trance with a goddess he leaves the world of men
now that it's settled, they will be sending you rich presents, madam; and once your grand-daughter's married to a prince, the elder master will get a high post for sure
a temple to tai po
in panic aunt xue and the others searched everywhere for good doctors, but not one was able to diagnose his illness until a certain bi zhan, a poor physician who lived in a ruined temple outside town, ascribed it to both internal and external factors: sudden transports of joy and grief depriving him of his senses and appetite and pent-up indignation resulting in congestion
why go to such trouble?
a filial son is seen off by his friends to search for his father in szechuan dr yu received his guests, and after an exchange of courtesies they sat down
but now it looks, doesn’t it, as if we were celebrating our own?
some people say he’s returned
does he have to go to the palace to have a good meal?
but as soon as the meal was over he called for tea to rinse his mouth, suspecting that his grandmother might be worried by his absence, and worried himself about daiyu
i’m sure you’ll inherit our noble ranks in future
chih and tu stood one on the right and one on the left of the incense table
better take siqi to her with the evidence, and after seeing it they’ll at most give her a beating and assign a different maid here
what’s come over you, miss?
sit down while i brew some tea for you, and tell me all you have been doing
she said, 'your aunt's delicate yet look at all she has on her hands
i kept telling you, ma, but you never believed me,  said chunyan
today, hearing that the old lady might be wanting fruit from the garden, we opened it in readiness
tranquil you sleep in your secluded vault;
presently niu pu came in wearing a new tile−shaped cap, new blue cloth gown, new shoes and new socks
you’ve come just in time
since i came here as a girl, your ladyships have been so good to me!
why, when she’s carried out wearing this, people won’t be able to take their eyes off her
all the cups on the tables were changed then for fresh ones from the basin, and when more wine had been poured they resumed their seats
so mr wei and mr sui are here
but when she picked up the chopsticks she still found them unwieldy
there ko lai−kuan in a lined gauze, jade−coloured gown, with a fan of wild goose feathers in his slender tapering fingers, was leaning over the balcony enjoying the breeze
as they were talking lady wang was announced
he says it's all right to keep up the connection now that our second master has inherited the title
after a simple meal we can have a good talk, said kao
i must have taken the wrong road before
daiyu, standing in the shade of the blossom, went on staring into the distance towards happy red court
they hired a small boat and set out that same afternoon without attendants, and had soon covered several dozen miles
why didn’t you go to the front?
if it comes out after they have left, we will have missed our chance
after a hasty tour of this monastery, he went back to sit in the same tea−house again—its name, the southern screen, was written in letters of gold — and here he drank a bowl of tea
i’m so tired, my bones are aching, protested xifeng
my old woman burns a stick of incense every day under the eaves, to pray that you gentlemen will become ministers too
at the mention of daiyu, though he still raves his mind seems clearer
when jia zheng commented on jia lan’s absence, a nurse went inside to ask li wan the reason
then ni er's wife and daughter told him their story
now, seeing that xiren’s wrapper was of black and white silk gauze, lined with pink silk, and in it she had only two worn silk-padded jackets and one fur jacket, xifeng told pinger to bring her own jade-coloured velvet wrapper with a silk lining, as well as a cape for the snow
i’m not afraid of you!
zijuan, who had just brought in tea, was puzzled to find the two of them like this
don’t stand on ceremony, sir, said yucun, rising
the little wretch just smiled and did not stir
thirteen years have passed in a twinkling since we left you at the foot of blue ridge peak, he said with a sigh
she asked baochai, did cousin baoyu take his jade with him?
yes, it’s the same
i am a rustic fellow who scribbles at random, replied niu pu
dear cousin, you’ve got me wrong, he said
this is strictly forbidden: it would have been a fiasco!
tomorrow’s still a holiday, and we ought to get up early
pasted on each boy's desk is the warning: do not imitate tu shao−ching of tienchang!
drink up now like a good girl
we must have some dress materials ready for them
as baoyu happened to come in just then, she asked him whether he had had his lunch
mrs lin asked pinger if she agreed, and the answer was:
he’s not afraid of you, mother, and won’t listen to other people’s advice either
for fear of vexing her he made no mention of going to see her brother
all agreed that it was time to disperse, so when xiren and baoyu tried to keep them li wan and baochai demurred:
some lamented her fate, some blamed mao yanshou the painter, and others reproached the han emperor for making him paint portraits of palace beauties instead of good ministers
the master of ceremonies invited the bride to alight from the chair, and baoyu saw a maid with a red sash help her out — her face was veiled
from the moon cave roll silver waves
the more serious charge is of abducting the wife of an honest citizen, who was forced to kill herself rather than submit
i have not been out for a long time, and have therefore failed to profit from your instruction, said tu
each one is a household word
but by now wang was beginning to feel quite sick at heart, so he declined to join them
by no daiyu was wide-awake
but we won’t teach you for nothing
but luckily here you are
what good friend is this?
just then, however, at the bottom of the hamper, she discovered a bowl of ham-and-fresh-bamboo-shoot soup
as she spoke she began to grow angry again
they are all good friends of mine
i hear from your mother that your wife is too unwell to go
now xue pan was a living example of the saying to cover the land of shu after getting the region of long
as for the reward, you can raise it by selling my jewels
his grandfather fell ill of rage, and since he was an old man of seventy with a lowered resistance and had no cordials to help him, in less than ten days he died
baoyu had to accompany her to lady wang’s place, only to find that his father had left already
if they were here, we could arrange baoqin’s wedding and then yours
and at this point jia lan and jia huan slipped away
one of them even picked up the gold chaplet that the new wife had let fall, and concealed it in her clothes
mind you don’t tell anybody!
he must have gone to find the hibiscus spirit, or in search of some other goddess!
seizing hold of aunt xue she demanded, just how did you murder my daughter anyway?
but because the imperial consort never sent for them, they gradually became lax in their devotions; and as they grew older they began to take an interest in men
one boat was for the bride and bridegroom, the other for the senior licentiate
he distinguished himself in the fighting against the huns, but was never made a noble
jia lian promptly called for his horse and rode off, accompanied by longer, leaving xinger behind to attend to other things
then zijuan told some younger maids to take the kite to the women on duty at the gate, who should give it to anyone who came asking for it
let’s go before baoyu sees him,  urged another
we shall have to send to the capital for more
jia she and the other men waited outside in the west street entrance, the lady dowager and the women outside the main gate, the ends of the street and the alleys leading to it all having been screened off
the messenger need not say a word, once you saw the rings you would know that they were for the young ladies
here is his letter, sir, and here are five hundred taels of silver for the wedding gifts
since your name is niu, said niu yu−fu, our family must have been the same five hundred years ago
after raising his chopsticks to invite his guests to fall to, he took merely a few bamboo shoots and cherries himself
he thought, this seems a bit lacking in respect
xifeng promptly assented and took her leave of aunt xue
how quickly the place has run wild!
drive all those humbugs out, i say
although the woman did not like the idea, as xifeng had done her the honour of proposing it in person she had to agree out of hand
tomorrow we can travel together
if i ever run amuck again, swore xue pan, may i be killed and disembowelled!

she said, 'she's come all that way with a load of things; let her spend the night here and go back tomorrow
what an odd thing to say!
though xifeng forced hersejf to crack a joke or two, she was less witty and amusing than before; but the old lady egged her on, in the hope of diverting baochai
so that’s the reason
a few strings of cash may not be much, but it was a rare honour
you’d have done better to show me in the first place
but pin−niang was born unlucky—her old trouble has started again
upon entering the hall, he wanted to pay his respects before the shrine of his former tutor; but the two brothers declined again and again

as yingchun lives on purple caltrop isle, let her be mistress of caltrop isle, suggested baochai
they strolled round the garden of concentrated fragrance and were served first with tea then wine; but it was simply an informal gathering of the womenfolk of both houses for a family feast, with nothing of special interest to record
baoyu, not yet fully recovered, was the only one not to go
it was nothing worth mentioning
all is ready for you to look over, sir, he announced
i should hope not, indeed!
all you need do is tell mr chin to give you the five hundred taels to deposit in a pawnshop, just paying me thirty taels first for minor expenses
then the two men went away
children wo not give me a moment's peace!
if not for this hill, observed jia zheng, one would see the whole garden as soon as one entered, and how tame that would be
but remarry as soon as he’s dead
yes, we’d forgotten them, chuckled the lady dowager
if you had not asked me today, i could not very well have told you
this was too much for lovely, and they started bickering from their respective places
but that only made mrs xia and her son set up a still greater clamour
as for our master bao, sir, that’s a strange story
xiren frantically clapped her hand over his mouth
and i’ll bring it up again in a couple of days
why not come with me to enjoy the strange sights here instead of puzzling your head over these silly riddles?
he has no sense of what’s fitting either
so suppose we sit up together to enjoy these sweetmeats and wine that i’ve brought with me?
they veiled my virtue, by their envy urged
during the first interval, from his seat at the head of the hall he watched this candidate in the linen gown come up to hand in his paper
he's an official in the provincial governor's yamen at soochow, with a salary of a thousand taels of silver a year
at the close of this song shiyin stepped forward
some squeezed inside while the others packed
in my own case, if i had any luck i should die now with all of you around me; still better if your tears for me were to become a great stream and float my corpse away to some quiet spot deserted even by crows or any other birds, to vanish with the wind, never again to be born as a human being
arrange two matches for them
he saw jasper lutes, rare bronze tripods, ancient paintings, new volumes of verse nothing was lacking
bring her some snuff,  baoyu told sheyue
how much more so in our case?
on his return he said to the old man: we have treated you very shabbily, uncle, giving you such a poor meal
then baoyu reined to a halt and turned to ask:
the most famous physicians and the most fabulous drugs were of no use at all
we not only do not need a middleman, there's no need for a written agreement
let’s see how he proceeds now to the fourth mistress
just send a boy tomorrow to ask doctor wang for some medicine, and that will set me right
it is certainly very strange, replied feng
that would have cost more, he said
as long as this is kept from her, we’re all right
still nothing proved of any use
now you’ve forgotten and say we’ve kept it
well, you are not a scholar anyway
li wen named the melody two scholars go to peach-blossom stream, and li wan who was next to her quoted:
just listen to him!
this had nothing to do with me
as for the maids, some doubled up in hysterics, others sneaked outside to squat down in a fit of giggles, yet others controlled themselves sufficiently to fetch clean clothes for their young mistresses
why carry on like this?
she has no sense of dignity and is too gullible
then, unable to bring himself to it, he could only rage for a while
i made qiuwen go for her meal, and just now pinger called sheyue out to have a word with her
well, i sha not question you now
when i came round, i remember seeing a shaft of golden light in the hall which shone on to my bed
give it to me, or i’ll break your arm
as they entered they heard crying inside the house, but soon this stopped and a meal was served
why do not you teach that spiteful brat of yours to behave himself?
sixth master also invariably referred to his cousins as first master and second master
he grasped at once what was wanted and hurried into town to get the chief secretary to write a letter in jia lian’s name, and set off with it that same night for changan county
but you must find it dull sitting here
xianglian stepped forward to have a look at him and, knowing the oaf to be unused to beatings, gave him only a few light punches in the face which instantly turned all the colours of a fruit stall
wang, he said, our young master is very ill, and the young mistress asked me to invite you over
if you were to go on like this till you had no achievements to your credit and your reputation was damaged, you could accuse me of disloyalty for not putting the facts before you
the sound in the courtyard made them wake with a start and prick up their ears, but nothing more could they hear
emboldened by this, qiutong went to second sister’s window to scream abuse at her, making her feel even more wretched
dismounting, they led their horses behind the screens, then stood to attention, their faces turned towards the west
this is your brother’s share
not knowing what had happened, fan chin's mother had hidden herself in the house for fear
i believe your name is wei, sir, he said
'he felt he had to thank me; but if i would acknowledged helping him, he would have had no face left

this silver is your fee as scribe
it’s quite simple really
when fenger explained xifeng's inability to entertain the guests, lady xing suspected her of shamming and shirking, but did not like to say this in the presence of so many relatives
i remember now, xiren said she was going to the pool at noon to wash some clothes
there's a very good diviner here from the south, a man called mao banxian
she’s going to question madam lian as well
li wan said, that sounds easy
not finding much of interest here, ma chun−shang got up and walked nearly a mile further
tsang chi kowtowed as well
what the devil's your hurry?
they all laughed heartily
with no answer but a smile he left with qin zhong
if you refuse it, i shall think you’re offended
this is what we mean by not letting the words interfere with the sense
baoyu had to rack his brains and then declaimed:
so that's who it is
her four chief maids get one tael of silver a month, the others only a few hundred cash apiece
in a frenzy, jia lian asked who it was that had fetched that fellow hu and had the man beaten within an inch of his life
they throw their money away on other people
the next day chu wrapped up two taels of silver and took these with some ham and other delicacies to literary ocean bookshop to say goodbye, taking home two volumes of the newly published examination papers
she hastily put down her chopsticks and stooped to retrieve it
we still have to return him to his original place and record his experiences in the world, so that he wo not have descended there for nothing
after these reflections she turned to xiren with a smile
yes, sir, replied chih
is the old lady well?
his wife was causing a fine commotion, moving furniture
i returned home at the end of winter the year before last and was sent to inspect some works, after which i served as grain commissioner of jiangxi until i was impeached and came back to the capital to my old post in the ministry of works
does not huan have his fair share of clothes, shoes and socks, not to mention a whole roomful of maids and servants?
i’ve no new jokes, but i’ll just have to brazen it out
it's not my place to speak ill of our mistress, but after one of her daughters was made an imperial consort she became too overbearing!
mist from the hills links the forests’ greenery;
the fact is, the manager here has engaged me for several months to select essays, and i have a few taels of silver as salary; but i have to keep part of this for my own expenses
he is now in gaol pending a decision on his case from the provincial governor
of course he is
yes, an old family friend
it gives a lucid account of musical theory and clear instructions for playing
except xue pan, who shook his head
magistrate hsiang wanted to raise him up and to bow in return
his salary would be twelve taels of silver a year, and it was arranged that he should eat with the monk, whom he would pay two cents a day
li wan told them gaily, before we’ve got our club going, someone’s trying to wriggle out
and when it came to jia she’s turn, the manager caught sight of baoyu
it’s like fragrant osmanthus, observed daiyu
may i venture to ask your honourable district?
we were looking just now in that small pavilion at the foot of the hill, and luckily the night-watchers were awake
as soon as they were alone, the old women started talking as they ambled along
we must have this out after i’ve won back my money
it would be another matter if our family couldn’t afford ginseng; but your father and mother-in-law can easily give you two catties of ginseng a day, not to mention two drains
when we have finished our meal and the wind has shifted, i will give you ten taels
well then, go to their homes and fetch them,  urged the maid
don’t be angry, your lordship!
though she was so weak that she felt the bed beneath her painfully hard, she stuck it out
otherwise it will look as if you’re still angry with xifeng
what an elder sister-in-law you are!
don’t tease him when he’s feeling low, she scolded
the bodhi tree is no tree, the mirror no mirror clear;
baoyu, huan and lan, who had left the room first, stood respectfully outside the door until jia zheng had gone before returning to ask the guest to sit down
her husband walked up to her bed
he's at the gate and has left his chair
i’ve come to see mr zhou who came with lady wang when she was married, she told them with a smile
chi wei−hsiao went inside, closed the door, wrote for some time, sealed up his paper carefully and inscribed a taoist magic formula on it
tsang's second name is liao−chai, said tu
baoyu’s face lit up
dispassionately appraising xiuyan’s character and behaviour, she found her unlike both lady xing and her parents, being extremely gentle and lovable
too bad, though, that it's rather late in the day so close to the examination!
there are such men in the world, true; but since we have raised this problem we ca not admit the possibility, for then there ceases to be any problem
you are wrong there, mr chih, protested kao
baoyu promptly passed on this request to xifeng, who ordered a serving-woman to take some venison to the garden
day after day she urged ha huan to go and ask for her, but he was too shy to speak and not too attracted by caixia in any case
this upset lady wang even more
it was now dawn
kuang chao−jen was about to choose an auspicious day for his return to yuehching when ching lan−chiang called to see him and invited him out to a tavern
if you were a man, you could go out and right wrongs,  teased daiyu
there’s nothing wrong with plagiarism provided it’s well done, countered the others
if you want to know who came out, read the next chapter
as she was bustling frantically about, a messenger suddenly arrived to announce: you’re to leave after serving the morning meal
tell me, third brother, he said, what made you so set on this salaried scholar's rank?
xiren hasn’t time to look after so many girls
so i brought your nephew here to ask for your help
to shield baoyu from his father’s displeasure lady wang said, it was the old lady’s idea
i couldn’t leave her before, especially not with my daughter-in-law so senseless
of course i do, but you took me by surprise
very well, they said
sending a hand-stove over from my quarters as if my hosts didn’t possess such a thing!
in the ning mansion
yucun summoned the plaintiff for questioning
striking the palms of both hands together she sneered:
one is already betrothed; the other would be just right for your honourable son
did you hear that?
opposing sides obey the self-same rule
the story-tellers rose to apologize
mr pao is twenty−three, and has no parents, no brothers, no children
baoyu clapped a hand over her mouth
i find poetry very easy, but with this i’m getting nowhere, he reflected as he sat there, his mind in a whirl
but there's no one at home to see to things unless we rope in qiang and yun
there's no need for tables either; each of us can have a teapoy with a couple of dishes we fancy, as well as a ten-compartment box of titbits and a winepot apiece
well, now i’ve forgotten how to
that's what i think, answered baochai
then they took their leave of xichun and went on to yingchun’s place
as the others thought of and called out the names of a dozen games, she put them down on separate slips of paper, which were roiled into spills and put in a vase

niu pu saw them out and had barely time to wish the old monk a safe journey before the horses galloped off with pounding hooves
not a workman but a waiter, li er replied
three or four days after this, his elder brother jumped into the river and was drowned; but how can he blame me for that?
of baoyu and xifeng
that little bitch isn’t cut out for such great fortune, nor are we for such good luck
not until prompted by xiren did he say yes
i thought he had already completed his studies and would soon pass the metropolitan examinations, she concluded
i heard say some scandal’s come to light and she wants to ask baoyu about it
not a single paper had been read to the end!
if you call that a poem, scoffed daiyu, i can write you a hundred
the twelve new songs called a dream of red mansions’, ordered disenchantment
if your girls are lucky enough to hit it off with these two young gentlemen, their fortunes are made
the best store of grain and dried fruits is to be found in the temple at the foot of this hill
you should not have come, protested the old lady
i’ve never seen anyone so clumsy!
i think it’s an excellent choice
then they all surged after mrs fang's shrine into the temple
after that, without further delay, he went to the examination at the capital, and in this examination he won the third place
just now she sent me to happy red court to deliver something
a whole lot of robbers have come, all in boots and official caps they'er opening cases, overturning crates, ransacking the whole place'
it started that day when i quarrelled with you and called her in to wait on me
quite right, quite right, he cried
but i think if you sponsor it, madam, it should come off
if our mistress were to give away the whole house, i’d get no face from it
besides, to be logical, the second part should refer to what precedes it
that’s why the last generations never engaged a teacher from outside but just picked some elderly, fairly scholarly kinsman to run the family school
if it weren’t for that, she’d like some too
the runner withdrew to sit in the gate−house
his household isn’t too well regulated
ask the gentlemen in charge
goblets fly here and there as men carouse
the brothers gazed at each other in silent dismay, then ordered the pig's head to be taken to the kitchen for the servants to eat
disturbed by these noises, she told zijuan to let down her bed-curtains
she gives others the best and you the cast-offs, yet you feel you have big face
'leave the withered lotus to hear the patter of rain
two serving-women had the portiere raised and two others ushered him in, while baoyu came out to greet him
lucky she who enjoys rank and riches in old age;
i believe my grandmother and aunt had just come back from bowing to the ancestral portraits, and the old lady's new red woollen cape was lying there
please sit down while i study this carefully, he said
but to know who he was, you must read the following chapter
'this is a bad sign!
after checking quickly through the list and asking lai sheng number wife a couple of questions, she went home in her carriage
what with one trouble after another here, we have forgotten about her marriage
granny liu assented readily and followed xiren out to the young maids’ room where she was told to sit down
i alone, it seems, know your worth
i won’t mind his being offended if i say he’s still a baby
we can discuss it together
and now she’s got us into trouble too
this seems very strange
the rules of prosody are secondary, the main thing is to have original ideas
but i do not know how to say it, uncle
if anyone sneaks off without asking leave and isn’t on hand when called, holding up our business, you’re to beat him for me and drive him out forthwith!
for you she would do it for love, but not for me
the pennons shook like serpents in the wind
why make an exception in this case?
but we are too poor to entertain you to a proper feast: we can only offer you a cup of watery wine
this had been going on for some time when one day, as luck would have it, jia dairu went home early on business, giving the boys a seven-character line to be matched with another and promising them a new lesson in the classics the next day

her voice faltered here from distress and she burst out sobbing
it will take mr pao some time to notify everyone; so we must allow a couple of weeks for that
they did not need any help
but poets will never tire of singing it,
though i don’t understand music, it does sound too sad, baoyu agreed
lady xing being now reduced to tearful silence, lady wang swore at jia huan, concubine zhao was a bitch, and she left behind her a misbegotten scoundrel!
very well, i’ll give you until tomorrow
though miss tanchun’s an unmarried young lady, you’ve all misjudged her
i did not blame you
in addition to describing scholars who are eager to become officials, wu ching−tzu depicts many pseudo−scholars who are cheats and charlatans
when kuang chao−jen heard ching speak of all these scholars, he asked: i suppose you also know mr ma chunshang who compiles essays for literary expanse bookshop?
before yuanyang could explain someone inside called out, the old lady’s woken!
then the troops concealed in the gully rose up together, their shouts reaching the skies
if there’s anything you want, tell zijuan to let me know
then, smiling, she said in a low voice, these two tunics and this skirt, four headscarfs and packet of embroidery silks are from me, granny
after a little reflection she went on:
he was beginning to be intensely irritated when the salt commissioners arrived, and after them the local salt gabelle officials, the prefect of yangchow and the magistrate of chiangtu county
the old lady thought back and chuckled
for fear it might not have stood up to the heavy rain this summer, i rode over on my own to have a look and, sure enough, found it slightly damaged

one afternoon his grandfather, old mr niu, was sitting in the shop with no customers to serve when old pu who owned the rice shop next door dropped in for a chat

in surprise he remarked, she’s so aloof and unconventional that she looks down on everybody
pity silly lads and plaintive maids hard put to
sagacious prince, risest thou not from sleep?
that evening he opened the old monk's room and slipped in
too bemused still to know who was speaking, he seized her hands
if you should find yourself short of funds on the' way, sir, since you will be passing lai shangrong's place you can enlist his help
i know all the paths in the wild miao settlements, he said
watch out for the fireworks outside, or you may get burnt by some of the sparks raining down
now that his turn had come to pay a forfeit, he also took paper and brush and wrote a four-lined verse which he handed to jia zheng
very soon the stranger returned
what are you still kneeling there for, you treacherous dog?
you are making your way up, are not you?
the circle, however, was only half complete, the other half being conspicuously vacant
she’s not very well
cried the lady dowager

wouldid not you hear him talk of the zhen family?
most of his previous posts had been in the capital, and he thought all official tasks the same, for even when appointed as examiner outside he had had no dealings with the local administration
it was then already the first watch, so they all went back to their own rooms to rest
what were you doing in there just now?
and since chih heng−shan and wu shu were close neighbours, he sent them notes inviting them over to meet his cousin
although already tipsy uncle xing did so, and the others went on carousing until they were all rather drunk
baochai, trying to console her, felt such a stab of anguish that she could not help sobbing too, while xiren was so prostrated with grief that qiuwen had to support her
when he had taken off his official robes and sat down in the same room as before, he asked pao wen−ching and his son to come in
when that old woman took his bowl to pour some for you, he said at once, i’ve dirtied that bowl; you must wash it first
you are afraid your cousin lin may hear and be cross with me for singing baochai's praises -- right?
from what she overheard she realized that the match proposed had not been agreed to
are not you old mr zhen, sir?
because master lian thought him an honest fellow he had him and his wife transferred here
his diagnosis was that her menstruation was irregular and some tonic would set her right
he can say i’ve been kept by the prince and will soon be back anyway
how did she seem?
do take it back for her
and if he had time in the middle of the day, he went out to play chess with the neighbours
this thrashing on an empty stomach and kneeling in the wind to read essays completed the wretched youth’s misery after his freezing night
back in her own quarters, the old lady made lady wang sit down to supervise the rooms’ arrangement
besides, think of all the trouble we had before things turned out well
xiangyun guessed that he was referring to her find
to try their luck
ting−hsi shed tears as he took the money, and a few days later moved into a room wang yu−chiu had cleared for him behind his shop
ignoring his sulkiness, baochai told sheyue and the other maids to keep an eye on him while she went to bed
and the curtains were let down too, so how can it have been a young gentleman?
it’s not all that important,  he said
it must be just like heaven!
stream and lonely hills glow with sunset at this hour
let's hurry up and cook this venison
while they sipped the tea she had ordered, jia cong came in to greet baoyu
as a matter of fact, mr tu created a dangerous precedent, said chen
but as it is hard to describe all their secret thoughts, we shall have to content ourselves with recording their actions
her ladyship has been raking up ancient history, and i had to answer her questions one by one
if one of the maids there had found it and your girl cousins saw it, that would have been terrible!
now that the whole household knew that xiuyan was to marry aunt xue’s nephew, lady xing wanted to move her out of the garden
he asked with a grin
they’ve been debating it for half a year: one day it was to be the zhangs, next the lis, then the wangs
we’ll make it the seventh
lady wang had been scolding him, but at baochai's entrance she stopped
why take a joke so seriously?
then your father would not be so angry, and all my trouble would not have been in vain
she should be coming soon to say goodbye
i had no choice
once he has the means of doing so, he naturally becomes an opportunist
if you find the school cold, mind you put more on, because we shan’t be there to look after you
you got the same as miss xue, while miss lin and the three other young ladies were given fans and beads, nothing else
being a disrespectful lot, behind her back we all call her the sick beauty
what scent has the caltrop, pray?
aunt xue then explained to xiangyun and daiyu what a pawn ticket was
after xifeng and baoyu reached home and had paid their greetings, baoyu told the lady dowager of qin zhong’s eagerness to attend their clan school, and the incentive it would be for him to have a friend and companion in his studies
if we were at my home i’d take a boat out
of course, i’m not all that fussy about my clothes, but what kindness has that woman ever done us?
the peasant revolts and risings against the manchus of the early years of the ching dynasty had been suppressed
i don’t know what busybody went and reported this as if it was something of consequence, just to prove her loyalty
i was wearing it till you grew angry
let each family pay its share, and you will get the thing going
he was rather taken aback to find them performing operas like master ding finds his father, huang boyang deploys ghosts in a battle, monkey plays havoc in heaven and the patriarch jiang kills generals and deifies them
jia zheng read the next riddle:
not venturing to follow her, he stood there woodenly in a daze and sighed, what have i done wrong to make them all cut me like this?
so i took it from her double-quick and gave her a piece of my mind, not knowing you’d hear
you can give more if you want
i’ll drink with you some other time
are these your lodgings?
bring the silver in at once
the next day fan chin had to call on relatives and friends
unable to refuse, jia lian had to take his leave of jia zheng and set off
if we take his word for it and there’s worse trouble of this kind in future, how are we to control these servants?
well, i have a fox-fur, but i don’t care for the way the fringe hangs and was meaning to have it altered,  said xifeng
once your marriage is fixed, that’ number be double happiness for you!
if we were writing a composition to speak for confucius, we should take exactly the line we are taking now the scholars' ranks were filled with such brazen hypocrites
no, i shall just have to slave away myself
can you spare me a few odd pieces?
what a pity i came too late to take part in that magnificent ceremony!
soon several dozen guests had gathered, but the last to arrive were three men in square caps accompanied by a taoist priest, whom nobody knew
panic-stricken lady wang could not tell whether it was genuine or not
if this is how the board's handled it, master xue has got off lightly!
it has to be kept burning day and night
but i can’t do any more
yet you talk like this, making us feel quite embarrassed
what remained of the money was spent on household needs
then you’ll have two homes, uncle
please put in a good word for us, mr pao
keep him on, i say, madam, and give him a good beating to teach him a lesson
observed the physician after feeling his pulse
why do you ask?
she grabbed all our family property and brought it over with her at the time of her marriage
within and without the city stand monasteries and temples with green tiles and crimson roofs
that's right, approved the rest
as we happened to start with poems on begonia, why not call it begonia club?
wang wanted to look at these
he used to live in a tutelary temple where he took a few pupils, and every year he prepared for the examinations
raising its head it saw in the moonlight a man perched on the tree; then it hurled itself furiously at kuo
he went back dejectedly to his own quarters to brood in gloomy silence
he cast them a sidelong glance
why not just discuss it with cousin ke?
i just wanted to be clear on that before leaving, sir
you are too modest, sir
though this pavilion is open on all sides, one does not feel the least bit chilly here
even if you’re bursting with anger, put up with it for a few days
but you mustn’t leave this place
so that’s who it is
he was on the point of going in when he heard yuanyang say with a sigh:
meanwhile li wan wrote:
jia qiang being too absorbed in lingguan to notice, it was left to the other girls to see him out
so it's you, shao−ching!
the next morning he washed with soap, changed into new clothes and scented himself lavishly; then, with chi weihsiao's paper in his sleeve, went by sedan−chair to divine pleasure temple
he called repeatedly but could not find him and, reaching the gate, saw li gui barring the way, refusing the monk admission
suddenly a wind sprang up and the red paper was blown to the ground, revealing the words underneath on the placard
as he was speaking, a servant came in
baochai asked them merrily
that evening on niu pu's return, the old man demanded an explanation; but niu pu was unable to clear himself and simply mumbled some literary jargon with a great deal of other nonsense
they’re all more likely than me to have such things
the next morning they parted, lu setting off for nanking to await chuang's return
tell her i’m back and her ladyship is here too
his mother, not believing him, sent the page to question the gateman
he had come to beg permission to take her home
the chief steward did not beat about the bush

taking their leave of xichun, they left smartweed breeze cot and followed a winding path which took them near bamboo lodge
the ushers led dr yu back by the west to his place as master of sacrifice, then returned to their own positions
on his way home the wind was against him and he felt rather unwell; and by evening he had a headache and high fever so that he had to go to bed
seems to me things can’t go on the way they are now
unless, of course, he has some miraculous means of shortening the distance
through seemingly casual incidents, the novel gives a most penetrating exposure of the government at that time
this said, he left
it took them a whole day to settle matters to their satisfaction
how am i to write it?
i have not seen you for a long time, li number four, said pan

she saw baoyu out of the gate, watched him get into the chair and lowered its curtains
why have i had no notice of it?
if so, xifeng would count as lenient, not as exacting
you must of course know
that saying is perfectly true
xichun, however, countered, how could a grown man like him get lost?
we haven’t been in for some time and don’t know what she’s up to
i’ve always wanted to play that
just then nanny song came back to report on her errand
hurry up and invite them
but while saying this she was thinking, drat it all!
qingwen told xiren then what had just happened, whereupon xiren dashed off to bamboo lodge
but it's such a hot day, with so many young ladies here too, that i do not like to presume without your permission
only the fourth mr chen was left at welcome pavilion
no, that would be a sin, a wicked sin
in future i really must make a study of music
miss xiangyun won’t let me go
i do not know what you are talking about
what's done is done, sobbed pinger
i’ve only studied for a couple of years and learned a few characters
i know what's the trouble with her
how can you expect to find them looking through clothes again today?
i didn’t know she had such a champion
but xue pan leapt to his feet
when you have time, do come and see me
he answered — affirming that he would be true to her
i won’t have it hushed up, declared baoyu
some went to ask, returning with the answer, yes, we have
baoyu asked after yun's mother and inquired his business
if i economize too much, outsiders may jeer and their ladyships will feel the pinch, while the rest of the household complain of my stinginess
last night i was thinking of asking my sister for the use of the garden for one day, to invite you to a simple meal so as to enjoy the snow
there’s nothing wrong with this place, but reed snow cottage would be even better,  remarked li wan
after a careful investigation he discovered that one of his subordinates had told the moslems of mr chang's part in the business
a clear stream welling up where the trees were thickest wound its way through clefts in the rocks
is there anybody staying in bamboo lodge?
he received the wine kneeling, drained it at one gulp, then felt better and kowtowed again in thanks
kuang chao−jen then returned to his lodgings
i will come back when i have seen him
after third sister’s suicide, it goes without saying, old mrs you, second sister and jia lian were overcome with grief, as were jia zhen, his wife and jia rong as soon as they learned of it
the other day on her birthday i checked our inventory of curios and found this listed there, but i don’t know where it’s got to now
merciful buddha, save me!
after leaving tu, wu shu had gone no further than lucky crossing bridge when he met a man in a square cap, old cotton gown, silk girdle and straw sandals
this decision taken, she changed boats at yicheng and travelled straight to nanking
nothing much, replied zixing
that oaf of a master of yours falls for every girl he sees, she swore
xueyan agreeing to this, zijuan went off
when you were twenty our masters were kind enough to help you purchase an official post, although plenty of real gentlefolk go hungry
while speaking she laid the table
they joined families because they have the same surname and their grandfather was an official in the same place as our old master
these look better-kept than other places
exultantly, kuang chao−jen thanked the examiner, and when he had seen him off he went back to hangchow to discuss with pan how to return to yuehching county to put up a wooden placard and erect a flagpole in his ancestral temple to honour the family
i’m in here, pinger called
i no longer dare keep you
as they were chatting, a serving-woman brought in the drugs
after this, the two friends were constantly together
then the dice-pot went to li wan who made her toss
heaven would not entrust such an onerous task to anyone but a benevolent sage
xifeng had already sent round a flowered lavender curtain, satin quilts and embroidered mattresses
when the servants returned and found their master gone, the boatman told them that he had gone ashore in pursuit of two monks and a taoist priest
after the second watch,  the maid informed them
kinsmen and friends came to offer congratulations, but disturbed as he was by his domestic problems jia zheng was in no mood to-entertain them
that would only cause a worse scandal
and a fortune−teller is sensitive to these almost imperceptible signs
why should not one of them at least stay here?
that would be a worthy deed
the lady dowager, lady xing, lady wang, madam you and her daughter-in-law nee xu grandparents as well as grand-children of the jia family had to go to court every morning when sacrifice was offered, not returning until two in the afternoon
i wonder what's become of its owners
he wondered what rare plant this could be that it was so specially treasured, observing that the faintest breeze set it swaying incessantly, and that though it was so small and had no blossoms its delicate grace was utterly enchanting
in her indignation she turned and left abruptly
pink petals fall in hundred flowers islet
the lady dowager’s gift was a purse containing a small golden effigy of the god of learning symbolizing literary talent and harmony
who can we complain to about this injustice?
jia zhen asked his wife, have we fetched the imperial bounty yet for the spring sacrifice?
you don’t know the half of it, my dear granny
this maid hurried to relieve them of their load
wait till my zijuan dies, it won’t be too late for me to use that phrase then
i think you’re right,  agreed xifeng
when is it to be?
losing patience, shiyin clasped his daughter more tightly and was turning to reenter the house when the monk pointed at him and let out a roar of laughter
he was in a quandary when a man in black rushed in
if heaven takes pity on me, i may recover
when she learned of his accident she hurried over to find him in front of the mirror, his left cheek daubed with ointment
you are wide of the mark again
i don’t know what that girl is like
caiyun, told by lady wang to see who she was, recognized her as one of the serving-women who had accompanied yingchun to the sun family
coming out, he went at once to find jia zheng, expressed his sympathy over his impeachment, then congratulated him on his return and asked about his journey
wang ren (忘仁 -- forgetting humanity)
after some days on the road they were approaching the capital when word came of the promotion of his uncle wang ziteng to the post of commander-in-chief of nine provinces with orders to inspect the borders
now her maid xueyan brought in her little hand-stove
this chance is too good to miss
for this mirror had western-style hinges enabling it to open or shut, and she had accidentally pressed the spring which made it swing back, revealing a doorway
lady wang explained, the last couple of years, what with floods and drought, our farms haven’t been able to produce their quota, especially of the rice of the finer kind
this is why jia huan and the others were not afraid of him, only yielding to him to some extent for fear of the lady dowager
he took the lad with him whenever he went out to tea−shops and taverns or on business trips; and he let him earn commissions so that he could buy new clothes, caps, shoes and socks
just then the old lady arrived with lady wang, li wan and xifeng
just yesterday you were saying you needed a couple of hundred taels
i’ve thought of a very good plan, said the attendant
what's to be done then?
just now in the old lady’s place, baoyu came out to pay his respects, remarked aunt xue
how cruel these people are!
how dare he refuse to help me?
but now that we are one family i am sure you will not laugh at me
men and women story-tellers who frequented the house came to offer congratulations
ask her what she just said about you
but what caused my mother's illness?
later on such a crowd will be going there on business, we’ll hardly get a look in
if they learned that the second master married you while still in mourning, they’d have him beaten to death!
the others chuckled, a dream does not count!
xifeng turned to lai da’s wife
that is what delayed me
although xiren knew what had happened, she dared not mention it and tried to distract him with some more cheerful subject
the flowers would still be spoiled
baoyu first watched daiyu fishing, then went over to make a few remarks to baochai, after which he joined xiren and the rest and sipped some wine with them while xiren prepared a shellful of meat for him
master bao was most emphatic,  insisted qingwen
i am afraid you will laugh at me
these last few days you’ve just begun to recover your appetite and have a little more energy; but you’re not completely well yet
besides, these aren’t worth much
now you dare make fun of me!
this gauze is pretty when new, she remarked to lady wang, but it soon loses its vivid emerald colour
asked pao with a laugh
miss baochai has gone, she informed him
we humbly invoke all divinities to show their divine compassion and display their spiritual majesty afar in these forty-nine days of grand sacrifice, that the departed may be delivered from sins and absolved from retribution there was more in the same vein
the boatmen rowed back
jia zheng’s wife, lady wang, bore him a son called jia zhu who passed the district examination at fourteen, married before be was twenty and had a son, but then fell ill and died
just get on with your work, little ancestor,  urged xiren
whenever you come back from outside, if so much as a handkerchief or pouch is missing they have to look into it, not to mention that jade!
xiren nearby heard him calling out in his sleep and shook him to wake him up
the fairy maid retorted
the wrong medicine was prescribed and one dose killed him
tell her i’m sleeping
lady wang knew that this was a bad business and warned lady xing against it; but the latter, taken in by her brother and wang ren, suspected lady wang's motives
no wonder she’s a vamp
xue pan, who had long been dubbed the stupid lordling, naturally found xing a man after his own heart
just leave it to me
lady wang also told xifeng, go ahead and eat with the old lady and aunt xue
when tea has been served, i will invite you to have a rest in the library
come back here tomorrow morning
lovely too on the water were the lotus flowers, duckweed and water-fowl made out of shells and feathers
he had often wanted to meet him, but his father kept him under such strict control that hitherto he had never had a chance
some trees and flowers are to be planted in the garden, and i was looking for someone to put in charge
naturally we keep quiet about it
she’s only nine,  remarked xifeng
your proposal is undoubtedly correct, general, replied the prefect
if i ate it myself, of course i would pay
i do appreciate her thoughtfulness
in dismay baoyu hurried to her side to soothe her, but she kept her eyes shut and paid no attention to him
how can she be so heartless?
the dance at an end, the herald announced: let all kneel below the steps as the prayer is read
this silenced baoyu for some minutes
high and low alike were splendidly dressed
before she could finish baoyu cried excitedly, you see?
how can you talk like that!
good, said jia zheng
never having studied them hard, he had since forgotten them and if tested on them now would be floored
both angry and amused lady wang exclaimed, what a fool this old woman is!
in the midst of this commotion jia lian came back and his cousin described what had happened
daiyu was already weeping
he proceeded then to the hall and was watching the pages shift screens, clean tables and polish the gold and silver sacrificial vessels, when a boy brought him a card and list
the jade had vanished, and they dared not report it
but there's nobody here tonight, and there's nothing i can do now you have come along
my maids are indolent from long indulgence;
i have heard that whoever hits the stars in heaven will be carried away by the king of hell, given a hundred strokes with an iron rod, and shut up in the eighteenth hell, never to become a human being again
if all i cared about was my own reputation while other people made trouble drinking or gambling, how could i face my aunt?
she would first fume at them then appeal to their better nature; and in this way she managed to send off batch after batch of guests after entertaining them all anyhow
the old lady smiled
whoever’s quickest can go on from there
since this garden took a year to build, painting it will naturally require two, what with grinding the ink, spreading out the paper, dipping the brushes in the colours and then
it’s only my nephew
you know which of the older girls have most sense
he moored the boat by the bank, and walked up to yang's door to knock
we boat people are a respectable lot, said the girl
at the same time that scholars were being bribed or deliberately kept ignorant, the rulers carried out a policy of cruel suppression
you jump to obey her instructions faster than if they were an imperial edict
one of the brothers−in−law was called wang teh and the other wang jen
then he blew out his lamp and went to sleep
now when i land in trouble he leaves me in the lurch
when your grandfather was alive, seeing how rich and influential our family was, he went to great trouble to get connected with us
why should i put my head in a tiger’s mouth?
only four or five days later, after kuang chao−jen had seen the examiner off, did he come back in his scholar's cap and gown to pay his respects to his parents
two maids protect baoyu's jade lest
after that they cleared the table, some young maids brought in a basin, and as soon as he had rinsed his mouth and washed it was time for xiren and the others to have their meal
you are always at home, my friend, said chuang to chih
after i have made my report to the authorities, i will wait for you in the capital
then you tried to excuse yourself at my expense, calling me petty-minded and quick to take offence
i have a smattering of knowledge concerning the hexagrams, astrology, fortune−telling, medicine, surgery, yoga and chemistry, besides knowing how to consult the oracles, said chen ho−fu
may i ask what business takes you to chengtu?
while dabbing at her own eyes she turned and took a silk handkerchief from her pillow, tossed him this in silence and covered her face again
that day aunt xue asked the others over to a new-year feast
little did he expect to beget such degenerates, a houseful of rutting dogs and bitches in heat, day in and day out scratching in the ashes and carrying on with younger brothers-in-law
if you are set on starting a poetry club, said daiyu, we must all be poets
every day they sent for doctors
my name is shen, answered big foot
when lovely yu and miss hsiao had given their names, he questioned ma chun−shang and chu hsien−fu
the people outside the window, hearing this, went off to attend to their tasks
i want you to introduce some ideas of your own
one morning, he had just washed and dressed and was thinking to ask his grandmother’s permission to pay another visit to his friend, when mingyan peeped round the spirit screen by the inner gate
xifeng spat in her face
as you were such good friends and he lived all alone here, with no parents or brothers, you ought to make a thorough search for him
he said that you were teaching in mr ku's family
didn’t we become friends as soon as you arrived here?
he san went out with him
after having seen to all this, he went to pay his respects to his grandmother and mother and to have his meal
the brothers stepped forward
niu yu−fu was most annoyed
jia lian asked second sister, but she could not think who it could be
i don’t care if i never get married
i ca not abide him, and that's that, she declared
what happened after that i don’t know
you must write an inscription for me some time too
this is a bushel of my brother's rice allowance, said yu yu−chung
what do you take me for?
is there no way to prevent it?
why should you tell such tales?
she must have gone up to heaven, i suppose, and because i am too vulgar to have any communication with the divine i have not once dreamed of her
he then accompanied his mother out and across to the other courtyard
at the beginning of the term his father asked the new village scholar, mei chiu, to choose a name for him
are you all right now?
no wonder it’s growing so chilly
my, what are these hard things?
he hurried straight over to him and saluted
the knowing maid quickly tucked it in her sleeve and went into jia lian’s room, where she showed him the hair with a smile
naturally they had no patience with such talk
this was because he could approach officials directly
let me fetch the scales so that you can weigh it
if her ladyship asks you why and how so much was spent, people may think we’ve been squeezing you!
but what was that about your gold phoenix tiara?
that's the way to do it!
she’s wasting her love on you
that’s how a girl should behave if she wants me to love her
just now you asked who would stay with miss xichun, she said
when the old lady had thanked him the doctor went out with jia lian to write his prescription, then left
one tapping the door’number to make the scene stand out
she found him lying fully dressed on the kang, raptly watching baochai as she combed her hair
who am i to be greeted as an equal!
in that case,  said xiren, let’s each have one final cup
she began to treat aunt xue as her own mother and baochai and baoqin as her sisters, feeling closer to them than to all the other girls, to the lady dowager’s great satisfaction
we have not seen each other for half a year, uncle, said shao−ching
there’s another reason too
the blades had the cold gleam of two autumn streams
jia qin, a young supervisor,
but they don’t have such a strange fragrance, do they?
the news of baoyu’s impending wedding to baochai, a prospect which daiyu had dreaded for years, had so enraged her that she had lost her senses
meanwhile serving-women had prepared the bier and spread bedding over it
do not be such a fool, jeered xifeng
after the second watch, when the guests living at a distance had left, they prepared to farewell the dead and the women behind the mourning curtain began to wail
and how can i repeat this to madam lian?
that same instant they heard a great clattering on the roo{ and watchmen came running to their compound to catch the thieves
overjoyed by this news, jia zhen had the timber fetched without delay
they know you are a kindhearted, liberal master, who wo not ill−treat them like some other people
do you mean those walnut wafers you left by the tiller?
our performance can’t possibly measure up to the standard to which these ladies are accustomed
baoyu bowed again in his delight and exclaimed, so it’s your birthday too, sister!
this was, in fact, the tradition in chenyuan prefecture
if the parents are snug, of course their sons will prosper
they walked along both corridors, and looked at the two libraries and at the building where the meat offerings were inspected
he must be hiding somewhere
hurrying over, bailiff chai called, little chin!
once you know him, you will be able to meet mr hsu
'i never spoke to you,  said dr yu
i shouldn’t be surprised if she surpasses even baochai and all the rest of us here
you are much more perspicacious than i am
baoyu wiped his tears and smiled
and since the others had left he asked with a smile, who was that girl in red this afternoon?
this was none other than chao ta, the brigand chief, who looked as fierce as ever with his dishevelled hair and wild eyes
besides, he was quite right
have you ever heard of such a thing before?
jia lian reflected and said, i remember that year when cousin bao fell ill, we got a man who was not a professional to cure him
you did right to admit this
pao wen−ching came in, in a black gown and small cap, and knelt to pay his respects
thinking her dead, lady xing started sobbing too
suspecting from this that sheyue knew what had happened, wuer numbermiled sheepishly and made no reply
at this point yuanyang arrived, sent by the old lady to say that she had heard of baoyu's relapse and xiren must comfort him and talk him round
but i’ve no paper or brush
and after all they’re your aunts, for all they’re young
when you go back, tell your husband from me: this match with the zhang family is out of the question
why should they do that?
though there won’t be feasts and operas, we’ll all have to go with her to spend the day amusing their ladyships, and that won’t leave us any spare time
in the forty−fifth chapter, when the yu brothers examine the soil and talk of geomancy, their gestures are so well described that we can almost see these fools trying to mystify and impress their hearers
don’t worry, she told him
just buy another half catty then, said bu
maybe she has other things on her mind and won’t send us away until she’s dealt with them
after you helped me, lieutenant, i taught for a couple of years and saved up enough money to come home
don’t fuss,  she retorted
fifty with me, i will tell you
besides, it’s not as if we ourselves had read the western chamber and the peony pavilion, which are licentious works
the best thing would be for me to take a holiday too, and go back with you
what if these two stories are fictitious?
she was sound asleep and covered with peony petals, which had floated over from all sides to scatter, red and fragrant, over her face and clothes
what medicine had the doctors prescribed?
i was convinced they’d make an ideal couple
the lady dowager said, this shows xifeng has good manners
lady xing looked round and saw some girls about
on the right side of the desk he had piled two sets of old books and one slim volume of essays
but who will bury me when dead i lie?
so how could you slip up so as to deserve punishment?
girls enjoy rustic fare at
baoyu sips tea in
if this is all, i tired of hearing it when my young lady was alive
i also had some of his ointment, and was very grateful for it too
get rid of him, quick, and fetch some doctor we know
they went to change their clothes before going to the reception hall
but they said since old mrs fang is being enshrined, they must join in her procession!
baoyu, wearing mourning, also went every day to the ning mansion, not returning to the garden till the evening after the guests had left
this has nothing to do with us
you must come and have breakfast with me tomorrow, and we will call on her together
his wife's arrival roused jia zheng to still greater fury and he belaboured his son yet more mercilessly
how stupid of me!
i don’t want that,  chuckled the latter
as the shrill music rang out, a little lad who had come to stand beside him clapped his hands and sang one of the songs of li pai
and drinking brings out all the worst in him
traces of frost stain the clustering flowers;
the courier congratulated him, and the messenger presented a despatch, which had already been opened
if we get the loot, there's no point in staying here we would better go to sea to have a good time, eh?
to the primal void
but it was here in our house, objected lady wang
once we have the jade, it’ll be easy to question the thief
no, i’ve had enough,  said madam you with a smile
some of the visitors had met them before
sixth master sat there awkwardly, drinking
he had no supper yesterday evening and passed a sleepless night, xiren explained
in the glare of a hundred torches the prime minister arrived, wu men, the main gate, was opened, and the officials entered through side gates
cousin daiyu is different
what i really want is a mouthful of hot spirits
he asked ssu tou
caiyun frantically assured him that she was not on friendly terms with baoyu, nor had she told anyone
lady wang was naturally so upset by this account that xifeng had to comfort her
none the less he objected, suppose, though, the old lady won’t let you go?
i have not called on you to pay my respects, but your ladyship looks in better health than ever
the two girls sat down
he is a native of chuchow
please do not trouble, said mr tung
pin−niang knew this woman, of course
yoo wants you to teach his son, and would like you to take up your duties soon
of course i do!
one dish was brought in after another
show him in, ordered jia zheng
please overlook my negligence, elder sister
at once qingwen and others ordered the gate to be locked, and coming back qingwen said:
a beautiful invalid has her fortune told in a bawdy house
then, pointing at a lute on the wall, he asked, is this yours?
the boy's name will be changed to pao ting−hsi
besides, he told me repeatedly he would not let me give you this unless you offered him some reward
baochai, having sized up the situation, told them, let go of him
on the third i prepared a small dinner for you, said shen
not i, said the abbot
you go and rest now
it’s not that i think them dirty, said daiyu
why take the official examination then leave?
xue pan took the pot, baoyu held the cup, and they poured two large cupfuls which feng ziying stood up and drained in a single breath
he wrenched himself free and made off
you know how much i dislike those vulgar conventions
you should not have done this, said mr lu
i am sorry i passed the district examination, since it means i have to address the local magistrate as my patron!
now you turn up with more yourself
surely you can taste the difference?
i really can’t stand your household any longer!
do not you mind hurting her feelings?
they feasted all day
madam lian says you and the young ladies must not laugh at her greediness, madam, she reported
i wouldn’t mind you finding another wife for your brother in-law,  she sobbed
the lady dowager smiled sarcastically
he was laid up for three days with a cold, and when i went to see him he told me what had happened
she offered them tea in the outer room and after sitting quietly for a while they left, having asked her to let baoyu know that they had called
baoyu waited, mystified, until jia qiang arrived with a bird-cage containing a bird and a miniature stage
still green the smoke from tea brewed in a rare tripod;
i can take him a message for you
don’t believe what those children say, miss,  they begged siqi
so i’ve brought it back
we just looked on this as an outing, but they have sent offerings under the impression that we are making a serious sacrifice of it
you don’t understand, said zixing
she came when summoned in great fear and trembling
fluting cast a subtle enchantment over men’s senses,
after drinking several cups of wine, tears rolled down mr
only, having been unwell recently and in view of all the troubles in the household, he had not yet referred the matter higher up
was about to explain that she wanted no special consideration from baoyu but he had recently shown too little' to his maids, when someone outside the courtyard gate shouted, that monk is back again
has baoyu been up to anything improper?
the next morning chi wei−hsiao called with tsung chi, who had served in the prince's palace
sixth master called for more wine to drink, while they listened to her singing
this is even greater nonsense!
you two have grown tired of making fun of me every day, so now you’re picking on her
kai called his son out to mind the shop, then walked off with the old man through the south gate
not lingering by breezy spring's peach and plum blossom
that’s enough,  she cried
she added, may i make so bold, now that i am here, to suggest something, madam
when they had begged chin to do all he could, he left
the brothers had no sooner sat down than they ordered whiskers yiu to buy them two new square caps, as well as baskets, bronze receptacles, awnings, door−curtains, stoves, candlesticks, candle−scissors, and bags for their papers — two of each
where do you want to go?
they drank tea and talked about the salt trade, after which a feast was spread with two tables each laid for two
let us go there together now
but this time our mistresses are too pernickety!
they had barely sat down, however, when the gate−keeper came in
and as he doesn’t mind how he behaves himself, you can’t blame his cousins and nephews for not being afraid of him
here in the boat
how can you compare yourself with me?
it was the old lady and mistress who told us to call him baoyu, so as to make him live longer and keep him out of danger,  they said
fortunate that her mother
to learn what followed, turn to the next chapter
it's bacon, said chu−ko after a couple of mouthfuls
presently, wringing her hands, she shrieked with pain, her eyes nearly starting from her head, blood trickling from her mouth, her hair dishevelled
the pillar of the earth i stayed beside;
after some conversation they dined and went to bed
surprised that he had been so indiscreet as to acknowledge his preference for her openly
now, honourable readers, though certain things are predestined and cannot be helped, it is wrong for sons of concubines or ministers of vanquished states as well as for men of principle and chaste women to keep using this phrase as a handy excuse
in the middle, 'three and six' make nine
otherwise other people will follow your example and make fun of her too
they searched all day in vain
if he were there and saw these books, his praise would make all the printers rush to have them
last time i had a bad fright till we heard it was just a rumour
by winter next year, when her cousins will have gone, it will be still quieter
pinger sent me to report this to you, madam
since your young mistress is in luck, of course you as her maid will be lucky too, which is more than your sister xiren can count on
this is no place for you to bicker and wrangle
take that as your subject, he said
i am faint with hunger
rubbish, said his father
when baoyu had assented he went on, i have told your brother ruan and your nephew lan to do some revision too
down south there they have so many ancient firs, they just extract the essence of the fungus on the roots and mix it with some kind of medicine to make this handsome snowy white pachyma cocos powder
it was only a slight chill
what sort of creature will he grow up to be?
and, finally, kang hsi set up the bureau for the compilation of the ming dynasty history, which was joined even by scholars who had hitherto refused to work for the manchus, for they feared lest otherwise ming dynasty history might be distorted
a big varnished table with a felt cover will be needed too
that’s the way to do it
but good looks and a sweet dispostition are hard to find
people not knowing the truth may think her cross-grained, when in fact it’s all due to this illness which has upset her liver and weakened her heart
they’ve written year after year inviting us to visit the capital
i don’t like incense perfumes
my family was poor, and we lived for ten years in a house rented from the nunnery; so i often went in to see her when i was free, and she’s the one who taught me all the characters i know
time enough to worry then
to plant them by the fence before my court;
bring the gentlemen's luggage aboard here, and send their boat back
as soon as they arrived, baochai sat down and announced teasingly, you must kneel down
jia qiang asked with a smile
jia she and jia zheng led the way, followed by two old nurses with horn-lanterns
at once jia rong’s wife qin keqing said with a smile: we have a room ready here for uncle baoyu
if you both sleep on that clothes-warmer, i’ll be all alone out here
but no more of this
if a match between the gold and the jade was predestined, how could baoyu lose the jade?
she soon noticed, however, that madam you was not her usual amiable self, simply sitting there lost in thought
his rule is strengthened by great bells of bronze,
the lady dowager, hearing this, called over her shoulder to xifeng, your third cousin's place is pleasant
in all the garden, not just these apartments, which servant have you ever seen reprimand her children in the master’s rooms?
we can see this is no ordinary beauty
he’s lost over ten taels already, but he never pays up
just wait with an easy mind, cousin, he urged him
it’s been reported to me that liu er’s wife and her younger sister ran gambling parties together, but mrs liu was really the one behind it
when this garden was built there was a detailed architect’s drawing, and though it was done by craftsmen the lay-out and directions are accurate
where have you come from?
