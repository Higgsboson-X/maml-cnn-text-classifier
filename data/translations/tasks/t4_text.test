i wrote to thomas just lately
leo naphta came from a little place near the galician-volhynian border
and yet, naphta added, after a pause, i would counsel you not to take this man and what he stands for as altogether a laughing matter; since we are on the subject, let me warn you to be on your guard
the hostess herself, her brother justus and his wife, and little therese weichbrodt were all well past sixty; while old frau consul buddenbrook, uncle gotthold's widow, born sliiwing, as well aa madame kethelsen, now, alas almost entirely deaf, were already in the seventies

his wife, who had given a sign to ida jungmann, held him back
but it is only fair to say one thing: i was just a child when i was married, a perfect goose, a silly little thing
the servants and the poor folk had had their presents and gone; ida jung-mann was chattering with riekchen severin in the hall--al-though generally, as a governess, she preserved a proper dis-tance between herself and the frau consul's maid--the lights of the great tree were burnt down and extinguished, the mon-ger was in darkness

lle deliberately brought to kretschmar unfinished things in order to be told what he knew already, then to laugh at the ar- tistic sense, the connoisseurship, of his teacher, which entirely co- incided with his own: the understanding which is the actual agent of the work-idea - not the idea of a particular work but the idea of the opus itself, the objective and harmonic creation complete, the manager of its unified organic nature; which sticks the cracks together, stops up the holes, brings out that natural flow - which was not there in the first place and so is not nat- ural at all, but a product of art - in short, only in retrospect and indirectly does this manager produce the impression of the spon- taneous and organic

unwilling to make him out as either better or worse than he really was, we feel bound to mention that the wretched wehsal, one evening when they were alone, prayed him, with pallid lips, for the love of god to tell him what had taken place after the mardi gras festivities, and hans castorp had good-naturedly complied, without, as the reader may imagine, introducing any wanton or flippant element into his recital

on the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with a broader flow, freshly and youthfully—but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or—and this is a sign of low vitality—it was never very well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been but a watch in the night

you see nothing but political trickery in the lofty exertions of democracy to fulfil itself internationally— where you would like me to see idealism or even religiosity
even the great-aunt, when the news travelled up to her end of the table, gave him a meaningful glance and smile; pretty marusja, who had barely looked at him up to now, leaned over and stared, with her round brown eyes, her handkerchief to her lips—and shook her finger too
we did not know
i’ve ordered another couple of hundred of my maria lately
you see in me a man who fought unwearied against fate, but was finally struck down
would not that, for me, the ordinary man, have something mortifying and depressing about it?
to-day he made a scene at the sitting of the central paupers' deputation; and a few days ago in the finance department the old skunk!
she took it with patience and tranquillity
yes, went on the youth, i made her acquaintance—a thing that isn’t so easy, hereabouts, you know
how’s everything in the big world?
you shall not pretend i had anything to do with your waiting—if you did wait—that i encouraged you to it, or even permitted it
frau magnus heaved a heavy sigh
he’s so lean—yet he’s robust; that is the impression he makes, at least that’s the impression i got at breakfast

while frau ziemssen, with her arm about his shoulders, tried to do so, he said hurriedly that he must write out an application for an extension of his leave and hand it in at once; and even while he said this, the short crossing came to pass, as hans castorp, reverently watching in the light of the red-shaded table-lamp, quickly perceived
her voice was growing louder all the time with vexation
it could never be popular; and the church, accordingly, had at all times been unpopular
near their destination was a beautiful view of a rocky stretch of the zügenstrasse
whether he had actually lived, settembrini said, was uncertain; yet his time had given birth to an idea, which had continued its triumphant course even up to to-day: the idea of the dignity of the human spirit, the idea of equality—in a word, they were celebrating the birth of individualistic democracy, and to it he would empty the glass they gave him
thy plaintive anthem fades
his black cravat showed wear, and he wore no cuffs, as hans castorp saw at once from the lax way the sleeve hung round the wrist
for although he was at bottom glad that settembrini, after all that had passed, continued, as he did, still to talk to him, admonishing, instructing, seeking to establish an influence upon his mind, yet his understanding had reached the point where he was critical of the italian’s words, and at times, up to a point, withheld his assent
i will speak to the bathing-master early to-morrow morning, when he comes to my room

the names at the end of the alphabet had lately been called in the ovid class, and presumably they would begin again at the beginning
lie knew well what would happen
he, behrens, must think it over
he could feel a few grains of sand from the beach, still inside his buttoned boot--how lovely!
the harsh, imperious call reaches the spirit on that remote path that leads into the shadows, the coolness and peace
yet it did seem to him rather premature to begin thinking about christmas even before the advent season, six weeks at least before the holiday!
he saw not only the unerring charm which his father exer-cised upon everybody: he saw as well, with strange and  d anguished penetration, how cruelly hard it was upon him
but even as i spoke i seemed to myself unspeakably fatu- ous; and even vorse, he saw it too, apparently shared my view, and felt ashamed on my account
this gently animated quiet filled little johann with a priceless sensation: the feeling of quiet, well-cared-for, elegant repose which was the atmosphere of the resort, and which he loved better than any-thing else
tony was in no state to share his feelings
first the covers were spread, one after the other, over the chair, so that a sizable piece hung down at the foot

his neighbour avoided contact with him
behrens asked, and fixed him with his bloodshot eyes

the port of cherbourg, we could confidently trust, had been put out of com- mission by the skill of german engineers; but it surrendered after a heroic radiogram to the fuhrer from the commandant as well as the admiral
her case aptly illustrates the general mood
she should have said beforehand that she was no good to play such a game, if she had the advantage of being whispered to
so it is not possible to say that herr settembrini condemned war as such
as for settembrini, he had more than once announced his intention of changing

dr faustus  i: if you could just keep quiet, prating jackanapes that you are!
to the point even that he was quite capable of bringing up all three as objects of his conscientious scruples!

well, and salt water would naturally make a tender skin smart, so he got in the way, in the service, of rubbing in cold cream
this statement was almost as improbable as it was objectionable; but frau stöhr swore to it by all that was holy—though it was hard to understand how the poor creature could expend so much zeal and energy, and be so dogmatic, upon matters like these, when her own personal condition gave so much cause for concern
well, he said to himself, i will go over to quisisana for a bit
no, as far as knowing goes, we never can
the consul would have been nai have indeed had he not realized that the good standing of his own firm was to the advantage of his son-in-law

one evening after the play, probably a little the worse for wine, the prickly but at bottom shy, inexperi- enced, and defenceless creature yielded to his practised technique of seduction and afterwards was prey to the illost scathing self- contempt
the frau consul began the conversation
he came to tea at five o'clock and said he had promised to be somewhere else between half past five and six, at the langewiesches' or rollwagens' - probably it was not true at all
for instance, the great-aunt and her charges sat once more at frau stöhr’s table, and marusja laughed as much as ever
dh, tony would furnish it to the queen's taste
i do not remember, said frau permaneder
it may well be, i like to think so, that elsewhere, in both elemy and allied countries, this short cut of fate was felt more as a catastrophe and gland nal- heur
but he was thinner and more active than his old friend, with bright little greenish eyes arid a long pointed nose
he was given over to the whims of the card-goblins, ensnared by the fitful and fickle favour of fortune, which sometimes let the face-cards and elevens pile up so that the game was over before the third tier was laid, when the fleeting triumph would stimulate the nerves to new efforts
the malay hastened to carry out his master’s will
we have told it to the end, and it was neither short nor long, but hermetic
the return to monteverdi and the style of his time is what i meant by the reconstruction of expressiveness, of ex- pressiveness in its first and original manifestation, expressiveness as lament '

her lips and even the tip of her nose were blue, probably from lack of air
the transition 'was made easy for him by his previous descrip- tions
but he promised it by this afternoon
the hofrat pretended to stagger backwards
indeed that absorbed and yearning look could only have been characterized as typically civilian
she winked and jerked her head in the direction of hans castorp, whose discomfiture she parodied with her mouth drawn down—no, illness and affliction had had no power to refine caroline stöhr; her jeers over the young man’s disappointment positively went beyond bounds
then he would look at his own hands, and their still clumsy movements, and see in them the hope foreshadowed of one day holding and using his knife and fork as grandfather did
morten lay turned toward her, his chin in his hands
a pure nature product--one knows just what one's eating

silent, silent night, in four stanzas of three lines each, the last stanza of which dismayingly enough runs: but an honest joy does itself destroy for a harlot coy
but the whole lower part of his face, longish and narrow, was neither buddenbrook nor kroner, but from the mother's side of the house
for he is a quite extraordinary personality, which by itself is something for women, and then he is hardly a civilian, like me, he is a sort of military, a bit like my poor cousin, in that he has a point d’honneur, a sore spot, as it were, which is feeling, life—i know i am talking nonsense, but i’d rather go rambling on, and partly expressing something i find it difficult to express, than to keep on transmitting faultless platitudes
faith is the vehicle of knowledge, intellect secondary
meanwhile the baying of old suso or kaschperl, jumping about and rattling his chain in front of his kennel, seemed never to stop; he became quiet only when no more guests came and the conpany had gathered in the nike salon, whither the servants hastily fetchcd chairs from the family quarters and even froin the sleeping-chambers above

frau chauchat had made special toilet for carnival, she wore a new gown, or at least one new to our hero, of thin, dark silk, probably black, or at most shot with a golden brown
perhaps he wanted to play the son of the house, to whom the warerooms were commonplace everyday; perhaps the coolness native to him in general might thus express itself; for he maintained an almost shoulder-shrugging in- difference to all these splend<?urs, replying to my admiring ex- clamations with his short laugh and a yes, very nice or funny stuff or what all do not people trunl{ of!
the other figure stood in the protecting embrace of the first, with round, youthful face, and arms and hands wound and hidden in the folds of the mantle

her upbringing had been no more than highly correct: she had spent two years in an aristocratic girls' boarding-school il karlsruhe, patronized by the court
well, as far as that goes, i do not know about the hat--but you were certainly not much more cordial than she was, my love
what delightful, cosy times they had going to bed!
i believe i do not err in assuming our agreement in the conception of an original ideal state of man, a condition without government and without force, an unmediated condition as the child of god, in which there was neither lordship nor service, neither law nor penalty, nor sin nor relation after the flesh; no distinction of classes, no work, no property: nothing but equality, brotherhood, and moral perfectitude

it will be issued in some twenty folio volumes, treating every species of human suffering, from the most personal and intimate to the great collective struggles arising from the conflicting interests of classes and nations; it will, in short, exhibit the chemical elements whose combination in various proportions results in all the ills to which our human flesh is heir
with rueful loyalty i had to reproduce a given thing; to transfer it from adrian's music-paper to my manuscript; and that i have done, not only word for word, but also, i nay' say, letter for letter - often laying down the pen to recover myself, to measure my study floor with heavy, pensive tread or to throw myself on my sofa with my hands clasped upon my brow

she was the only guest, for her daughter, who was to have gone, had visited her husband that afternoon in the prison, and felt, as she usually did, exhausted and incapable of further effort

herr criinlich, in his long-skirted frock-coat and silk waistcoat, waited at the door
but on what pretext?
i cannot play that, my dear lady!
t the time we were there the experience which is the basis of the manuscript lay already in the past; that adrian at that time had already had the conversation which fol- lows, amounts with me to a certainty; so does it that he vvrote it down at once after the event, presumably the very next day
i recalled what he had written from halle to kretschmar about the extension of the kingdom of the banal
and then, at her request, he gave an exposition of the existing legal grounds for divorce, and an even longer dis-course after it, which had for its subject-matter the law touching dowry rights

i have heard you call hofrat behrens that before, herr settembrini
thus in the inmost recesses of nature, as in an endless succession of mirrors, was reflected the macrocosm of the heavens, whose clusters, throngs, groups, and figures, paled by the brilliant moon, hung over the dazzling, frost-bound valley, above the head of our muffled adept

in- deed, my mind misgives me that  shall only be awakening the reader's doubt whether he is in the right hands: whether, i mean, my whole existence does not disqualify me for a task dictated by my heart rather than by any true competence for the work
