the archdeacon, seeing that all his violent efforts served only to weaken the one fragile support left to him, had decided not to move any more
i’ll take care not to
i understand,  he answered
her hair was covered in gold dust, curled in front, and at the back hanging down in long braids with pearls at the end
with their big eyes, big bellies and both arms raised shoulder high, they looked as though they were alive under their fresh paint and sharing in the people’s delight
the moment the archdeacon noticed this unknown man his attention seemed to be divided between the dancer and him, and his expression grew darker and darker
but a hundredfold more would have been needed to take the town
it was as though he felt that she was something delicate, exquisite, and precious, made for other hands than his
this affection developed to an exceptional degree
he studied languages, latin, greek, hebrew, a threefold sanctuary at that time frequented by very few
an infernal priest who is pursuing me!
a peasant poaching noblemen’s game!
the text has been abrogated,  said the advocate extraordinary to the king
she began singing to an old tune:
a fine beauty indeed!
then phoebus roared with laughter and wagged his head with a triumphant look
at least,  he thought,  i may find there a brand from the bonfire to warm me up, and find a crumb for supper from the three great coats of arms worked in royal sugar they are bound to have set up there on the buffet offered to the public by the town
and her voice lingered plaintively, as if calling to someone
as she said this, with her other arm stretched out of the window she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe
brother,  answered the student, striving to achieve a decent, piteous, and modest demeanour, turning his cap round in his hands with an air of innocence,  i was coming to ask you …’
it was the hour when the first early-morning windows in the great city open cheerfully upon the roofs
you came here to see the curiosities of paris
charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous frown of a poet searching for a rhyme
and they are going to take her away again!
so he would pour out his heart to them at length
once the mercenaries were destroyed, the nomads would give him no more trouble
in each a triple row of bronze chains, fixed to the navels of the pataeci gods, stretched in parallel from one end to another; the crowd was crammed against the houses and, in the middle, walked the elders’ servants, brandishing lashes
at that he slowly lowered his arm, and looked at the pavement in deepest despondency
it’s true that those little feet were so tiny, so pretty, so pink!
it meant: printing will kill architecture
they promised us a feast of fools, with the election of a pope
mahiette sighed and wiped a tear from her eye
the drinking bowls, rimmed with convex mirrors, multiplied the magnified reflection of things around; the soldiers pressing around looked at their own reflections with amazement and pulled faces to amuse themselves
this time coppenole bowed with guillaume rym
you will be alone with him
they assured him that they would go back to the others to fulfil them
mâtho restrained a cry
first there appeared people of the local race, then slaves from the countryside
first he spoke about the siege; but he had only come to relieve his pain by talking about salammbo; spendius urged him to be sensible
at the bastille saint-antoine, at the palais de justice in paris, at the louvre, these underground constructions were prisons
her mother answered in a feeble voice, and hugging her tightly in her arms smothered her with kisses
at first mâtho had kept himself out of the fight so that he could better exercise command over all the barbarians at the same time
she languished all day long, and revived in the evening
down in the parvis some good women, carrying their milk-jugs, pointed out to each other in astonishment the strangely dilapidated state of the main door of notre-dame, and two congealed streams of lead between the cracks in the sandstone
fat, bearded, eyelids lowered, she seemed to be smiling, with her hands crossed over the edge of her great belly – worn smooth by the kisses of the crowd
they were afraid of knocking something over with their long robes
the usher called sharply
the impressions made on him by objects underwent considerable refraction before reaching his mind
the recluse stood upright with a desperate cry
he threw javelins with frightening speed, letting out at intervals a long shrill whistle; the great beasts, docile as dogs, looked towards him during the slaughter
at the bottom of byrsa spread a long black mass: it was tanit’s temple, an ensemble of monuments and gardens, courtyards and entrance courts, surrounded by a small drystone wall
henriet went back to the provost once more, wholly at a loss
their commander dismounted and came over to her
she had realized that there was a wall all round her, that beneath her was a flagstone covered with water and a bundle of straw
they were at once accepted
then he lifted up to heaven his two empty hands, closed his eyes, and opening his arms like a man throwing himself into the sea from the top of a cliff, he hurled himself upon the pikes
then he had hunted elephants in the forests of the garamantes
down on your knees!
when you say that name, unhappy creature, it is as though you were crushing every fibre in my heart between your teeth!
jehan did not let him finish
he kissed his two thumbs as a token of friendship, blaming his anger on the drunken feast; then he spoke at length against carthage, but did not say what brought him among the barbarians
which is exactly what he had feared
the solemn lines of the architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects around the girl, the devout and severe thoughts given off, so to speak, by every pore of the stonework, acted on her without her knowing
the building is not typical
today it’s my turn, i’m going to eat gypsy!—oh!
many, by some strange aberration, repeated the same word or continually made the same gesture
however, the student joannes was not asleep
it was not an attack by picards or burgundians, not a procession of relics, not a student revolt in the laas vineyard, not our aforesaid most dread sovereign lord the king’ making his entry, not even the fine spectacle of men and women being hanged for robbery at the palais de justice in paris
my head is ringing like a belfry
beside the pallet was a window, its glass caved in like a spider’s web battered by rain, and through the broken lattice could be seen a patch of sky and the moon in the distance, resting on an eiderdown of woolly clouds
he kept his head bent so low on his chest that there was nothing to be seen of his face, covered in shadow, but for the tip of his nose, on which a ray of light fell and which must have been a long one
yet her song breathed joy above all, and she seemed to sing, like a bird, out of serene and carefree happiness
according to spendius, they must wait
they’re watching a hundred faggots burn; a fine entertainment!
soldiers leapt up to free them and disappeared
but the man in black finally straightened up, gripped the oars again, and continued upstream
he would have brought for her from the country of the negroes things which did not exist in carthage, and the apartments of their house would be strewn with gold dust
the archdeacon, however, had not even stood up for this person
the punic square split up; three columns were swallowed up, swirling beneath the gateway
said gringoire, it’s because his father and mother were whimsical people who gave him a taciturn disposition
she doesn’t belong to the king!
the bell, in unbridled frenzy, offered to each side of the tower in turn its bronze throat, emitting its tempestuous breath which could be heard four leagues away
but from the side streets an enormous crowd poured out
a nothing, your science of the heavens!
here and there a stone phallus rose up, and big stags wandered about peacefully, kicking fallen pine cones with their cloven hoofs
so far no one lives there, or i should become king of the country
it is the only change a courtier’s face can register
the people listened devoutly
a roaster, a pottinger, a sauce-maker, a chief cook, an armoury-keeper, two sumptermen at number livres a month each!
the colleges, which were in fact the intermediate link between the cloister and the world, stood midway in the series of monuments between the mansions and the abbeys, with a severity full of elegance, less frivolous sculptures than the palaces, less earnest architecture than the convents
the sun had gone down behind the lofty tour de nesle
during the last war extortions had increased, so that of the libyan towns, nearly all had given themselves up to regulus
otherwise along the bank of the seine ran either a bare strand, as it was beyond the bernardins, or a clutter of houses with their feet in the water, as between the two bridges
one day finally, or one night (for midday and midnight were the same colour in this tomb) she heard above her a louder noise than that usually made by the warder when he brought her her jug and her bread
from time to time a flush of shame, a flash of anger, inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; a disdainful word seemed to tremble on her lips; she made her little grimace of contempt, with which the reader is familiar; but she kept silent
she was not, however, fully reassured
and let not one of them get away except to the gallows of montfaucon
the parvis was resplendent and projected its radiance into the sky
meanwhile the galley tossing among the rocks came alongside the mole, and the crowd followed it along the stone slabs, crying:
salammbo, who was watching them go away, lowered her head, and taanach, thinking she could guess the cause of her grief, said softly to her:
no one now laid down his arms, and the fury of all concentrated on gisco in a frenzy of hate
mâtho was stifling in the heated atmosphere beating down on him from the cedar partitions
its red-fanged jaws gaped open horribly; its enormous nostrils flared, daylight brought it to life, giving it a terrible, impatient look, as though it would have liked to leap outside, fuse with the star, the god and together with it cover the vastness of space
gradually others appeared, wandering in groups of ten, twelve, twenty-five men; several of them drove goats or some lame cow
well, now,  phoebus went on, you got away very smartly the other evening
there was no spectacle in the world, not chambord, nor the alhambra, more magical, more ethereal, more marvellous than this cluster of spires, turrets, chimneys, weathervanes, spiral staircases, open-work lanterns, looking as though they had been stamped out with a punch, pavilions, spindle-shaped turrets or, as they were then called, tournelles, all of different shapes, height, and altitude
it’s a pity,  growled the torturer as he looked at such graceful and delicate limbs
as for him, he would not have had the slightest idea where he was had he not noticed in passing, at a bend in the street, the octagonal bulk of the pillory in the halles, its open-work top boldly silhouetted against a window where a light still showed in the rue verdelet
the candles, whose number had not been increased, gave so little light that one could not see the walls of the hall
]; homo homini monstrum [man is a monster for man]; astra, castra, nomen, numen [stars, camp, name, divinity]; μέγα βιβλίον, μέγα κακóν [great book, great evil]; sapere aude [dare to know]; flat ubi vult [it bloweth where it listeth], etc
but when the gap had closed to three hundred paces the elephants, instead of advancing, turned round; then the clibanarii wheeled about and followed them; and the mercenaries’ surprise increased as they saw all the archers and slingers running to join them
it is a comforting thought, be it said in passing, that the death penalty which, three hundred years ago still cluttered up with its iron wheels, its stone gibbets, its whole apparatus of punishment permanently fixed into the pavement, the grève, the halles, the place dauphine, the croix-du-trahoir, the marché-aux-pourceaux, the hideous montfaucon, the barrière des sergents, the place-aux-chats, the porte saint-denis, champeaux, the porte baudets, the porte saint-jacques, not to mention the countless ladders’ of the provosts, the bishop, the chapter, the abbots, the priors with rights of jurisdiction; not to speak of judicial execution by drowning in the river seine; it is comforting to think that today, having lost one by one all the pieces of her armour, her profusion of torments, her imaginative and fanciful punishments, her torture for which she had a new leather bed made every five years at the grand châtelet, that old sovereign ruler of feudal society, almost expelled from our laws and our towns, hunted from code to code, driven from place to place, has nothing left in all our vast city of paris but one dishonoured corner of the grève, one wretched guillotine, furtive, anxious, ashamed, seemingly always afraid of being caught red-handed, to judge by the haste with which it disappears once it has done its job
he snatched the gypsy girl from the astounded quasimodo’s grasp, put her across his saddle, and just as the redoubtable hunchback, recovering from his surprise, rushed at him to take back his prey, fifteen or sixteen archers appeared, following close behind their captain, their great swords at the ready
look, dear brother claude, i would not come to you with any dishonourable intentions
someone had no doubt impelled her?
the truands turned about in alarm
mathias hungadi shook his head
apart from the pikes on their chest harness, the spikes on their tusks, bronze plates covering their sides, and daggers fastened on their knee pads – at the end of their trunks they had a leather ring holding the handle of a large cutlass; starting off all together from the end of the plain, they advanced from each side, in parallel lines
sonant melliflua hymnorum organa, suavissima angelorum melodia, cantica canticorum mira!
since the morning in the pillory, it had seemed to the people living near notre-dame that they could detect a considerable cooling-off in quasimodo’s ardour for ringing the bells
on the right side of his throat spurted a stream of blood; at once delirium began
first of all we feel a buzzing in our ears, our eyes are dazzled
narr’havas was already coming towards him
his protruding angles fitted, if we may be allowed the comparison, the concave angles of the building, and he seemed to be not just its denizen but its natural contents
suddenly he saw on the horizon, behind tunis, what looked like wisps of fog, trailing along the ground; then there was a great curtain of grey dust extending vertically, and in the eddies of this numerous throng appeared the heads of dromedaries, lances, shields
on a pillory the spectacle was sublime
maître simon sanguin, elector of picardy, with his wife on the pillion
but on top of the walls rose long cranes used for fitting ships’ masts; and from them came down enormous claws ending in two semi-circles toothed inside
when he came down on to the platform between the towers, his ideas were all mixed up in his head
he let out a violent cry, like a wretch being burned by the red-hot iron
laden dromedaries moved down the ramps
in the form of printing, thought is more imperishable than ever; it is volatile, elusive, indestructible
i will make her die, spendius!
motionless, with head bowed, she looked at the soldiers
he had just caught sight of the student
he was sorry not to have deserted to the romans with the two thousand gauls of the temple of eryx
and then there was this fine report in latin which the under-monitor of torchi brought piteously to dom claude with the distressing marginal note: rixa, prima causa vinum optimum potatum [brawl, main cause: excellent wine drunk]
there each individual work, however fanciful and isolated it may seem, has its place and its projection
that in any case is one tradition of the gaols and galleys which has not been abandoned, and which handcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle, humane people (hard labour and the guillotine in parentheses)
they wanted to run upon the barbarians at once; the suffete made them rest for two hours
give me back my child!
i am the author of the mystery performed today, with great success and attended by a great throng of people in the great hall of the palais, no less
gringoire had managed to find out that when she was still very small she had travelled through spain and catalonia and as far as sicily; he thought she had been taken, in the zingari caravan of which she was part, to the kingdom of algiers, a country situated in achaea, the said achaea bordering on one side lesser albania and greece, and on the other the sicilian sea, which is the way to constantinople
between the rue vieille and the rue neuve du temple lay the temple, a sinister cluster of towers, tall, upright, and isolated amid a huge crenellated enclosing wall
then, i’m desperately sorry, but i must fulfil the duties of my office
it was a semicircle of rags, tatters, tinsel, pitchforks, hatchets, legs unsteady with wine, great bare arms, sordid, lacklustre, besotted faces
she thought of all the beauty in life, youth, the sight of the sky, aspects of nature, love, phoebus, of all that was fleeing away from her and all that was coming closer, the priest denouncing her, the executioner who was coming, the gibbet standing there
at this shameless declaration the archdeacon’s features took on an entirely pedagogic and paternal expression
none of the furniture of an ordinary apartment was to be found in this room, no benches, no trestles, no forms, no common box stools, no fine stools supported on pillars and counter-pillars at number sols each
old men carried the wounded, and pious people continued the token funerals of their relatives and friends, who had died far away during the war
for the rest he was a good fellow
when he pulled the child out of the bag he found that it was indeed badly deformed
but not a sparkle of gold
good, another light of love!
now i’m going away
if i’d known, i’d have given you virgin marys, you nosy idlers!
the unclean-eaters, acting as referees, said they were being cheated
meanwhile windows had opened again
they could not deliberate about war: and when they were beaten the grand council crucified them
he did not answer
have him choked in the dungheap
erat enim ut si mundus, ipse excutiendo semet, rejecta vetustate, candidam ecclesiarum vestem indueret (glaber radulphus)
quand à paris dame justice,
i was once very rich, and i spent all i had
while she was asleep!
the night just past was precisely a saturday
some took rope ends which they lit for torches
they stayed shut up in the third enclosure, as inexpugnable as a fortress
do you want her to pay you on the nose?
with its great ebony staircase going straight up, the prow of a defeated galley fixed in the corners of each step, with its scarlet doors quartered with a black cross, its bronze grills as protection against scorpions below, and its trellisses of gilded rods blocking apertures above, it seemed to the soldiers, in its savage opulence, to be as solemn and impenetrable as hamilcar’s own features
the storeys of these prisons, as they plunged deeper into the earth, became darker and more cramped
is it the gypsy he’s looking at like that?
that’s the best we’ve got
she had, moreover, quite ceased seeing, or hearing, anything of quasimodo
the crowd opened, and let through a pure, dazzling figure
to make a wide enough opening they had only to dislodge one course of stone underneath the window
that poor little dancer with her goat!
and then, did it count for nothing to have supreme authority over the sergeants of the douzaine, the keeper and watch of the châtelet, the two auditors of the châtelet, auditores castelleti, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen districts, the gaoler of the châtelet, the four hereditary sergeants, the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, the hundred and twenty sergeants of the wand, or catchpoles, the captain of the watch with his watch, under-watch, counter-watch and rear-watch?
that makes quite a fair portion of my town!
the duke of egypt, without uttering a word, brought up a clay pitcher
at last they arrived on the upper platform
but the carthaginians were reluctant to obey him, finding it so enjoyable to stick their swords into the barbarians’ bodies
they grew restive, hunching their shoulders as though being scourged – you do not even know if he is alive or dead!
the gypsy looked at the hilt, the blade, examined with adorable curiosity the cipher on the guard, and kissed the sword, telling it: you are the sword of a brave man
that gypsy, as you know, who comes to the parvis every day to dance, despite the official’s prohibition
the eleven steps up to the portal were packed with them
what is suitable for a legate,  the stranger said rather dryly, is not suitable for a princess
he drove back the gauls and all the barbarians found themselves virtually besieged
in the light of a moonbeam escaping between the clouds spendius saw a gaping wound in the middle of the arm
gringoire blocked up his ears
the old woman treated him like a lord, and put the gold piece away in a drawer
down with the six theologians in their white surplices!
at the corner of an oleander copse her horse reared up at a man’s corpse lying on the ground
finding the ladders inadequate they used tollenones – devices consisting of one long beam set transversally on another, and bearing at its end a square basket in which thirty infantrymen and their weapons could find room
you must agree that i’m no fool
it would be better to take his revenge later through some trick; so he signed to his soldiers and slowly withdrew
it was like some poor, sinful soul being questioned by satan beneath the crimson wicket-gate of hell
go on, go on,  said the cardinal, it’s all the same to me
the only light that quasimodo could see was at the window of a distant building, whose vague and sombre profile stood out well above the roof-tops, over towards the porte saint-antoine
salammbo went up to the terrace of her palace, supported by a slave-girl carrying burning coals in an iron tray
cried the captain, half kneeling
that was all it needed
isn’t that worth something?
adultery is curiosity about the sensual pleasure of another … oh!
however hamilcar bitterly regretted being unable to communicate with the king of the numidians, whom he knew to be behind the barbarians and ready to fall on them
behind him, higher than a catafalque, rose a huge chest, fitted with hanging rings like crowns
fleur-de-lys put her hands over her eyes so that she would not see
at utica, spendius’ army had just gone, and the inhabitants were beginning to burn the machines
her eyes were dry and burning
pile it up and keep it!
all he did, and it was another way of interrogating the archdeacon, was to follow the direction of his line of sight, and in that way the eye of the unfortunate deaf man fell on the place de grève
from the street of khamon to the herb-market the whole perimeter path now belonged to the barbarians, and the samnites finished off the dying with their pikes; or, with one foot on the wall, they looked down below at the smoking ruins, and the battle starting again in the distance
they couldn’t go after them
twelve hours later all that remained of the mercenaries was a heap of wounded, dead and dying
it is humanity’s mode of expression totally renewed, human thought discarding one form and putting on another, it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that symbolic serpent which, ever since adam, has represented intelligence
clopin came up to him
diamond discs were sprinkled over its long blue robe, and chains, buried under flagstones, fastened it by the heels to the ground
then the tables were covered with meat dishes: antelopes with their horns, peacocks with their feathers, whole sheep cooked in sweet wine, haunches of she-camels and buffaloes, hedgehogs in garum, fried grasshoppers and preserved dormice
in fact the soldiers recalled a loud cry; spendius, who had fled at the head of the columns, had not heard it
for a box of grease for greasing the king’s boots—number deniers
the captain picked up a corner of the tapestry: who, fair cousin, is this stout soldier blowing a trumpet with all his might?
yes, it’s my pruning hook
they crept along the nopal hedges bordering the paths
jehan coldly replied: here are the pebbles i pave my fob with
he armed their drivers with a mallet and chisel, so that they could smash their skulls if they stampeded in combat
there, i’ve put myself behind the wall
at last a man tottering, pale, and hideous with terror, pushed a child; then a small black mass could be seen in the hands of the colossus; it was swallowed up in the dark opening
the carthaginians had not tried to pursue the barbarians
mâtho ordered all the women to be driven away ruthlessly
a man went by, plodding along as oxen do
there were two of us
but the continual uncertainty in which he kept them eventually annoyed them more than any defeat
it was the gypsy girl
a great tumult surrounded the town
a violent conflict raged in his mind, in which, like jupiter in the iliad, he weighed up the gypsy and the goat in turn; and he looked at them, one after the other, his eyes moist with tears, as he said between his teeth: yet i can’t save you both
so they were going round the world in a search and quest for this beauty, and having rejected successively the queen of golconda, the princess of trebizond, the grand khan of tartary’s daughter etc, etc, husbandry and trade, nobility and clergy had come to rest themselves on the marble table of the palais de justice, while they uttered before the worthy audience all the sentences and maxims which could at that time be dispensed in the faculty of arts in the examinations, sophisms, determinations, figures, and acts at which masters were capped for their degrees
a stifling atmosphere filled this mystic place
as he went towards the purple works, he passed by the slave prison, a long house of black stone built inside a square pit, with a little path all round it and four stairways at the corners
in that case it is because the people’s hour has not come
she was dressed in white, and had a white veil over her head
women stretched out on the corpses, mouth to mouth, brow to brow; they had to be beaten to drive them back, when the earth was thrown over the dead
the catapult rolled to the edge of the platform; and, carried away by the load on its shaft, it fell, smashing the lower storeys beneath it
our purple fisheries are pretty well exhausted, even pearls are becoming exorbitant; we barely have enough unguents for the service of the gods!
he still owes me money for my epithalamium, and he came within an ace of having me hanged this evening, which i should have found most embarrassing
she relapsed into a thoughtful silence
he likewise passed through all the degrees in arts, from bachelor to master to doctor
besides, the barbarians were countless and once their weariness was past they would begin again
at night he sat beside their pit, and in their groans found something of the voice that filled his heart
how much more solid, durable, and resistant a book is a building!
there too was a big armchair and a big table, compasses, alembics, animal skeletons hanging from the ceiling, a sphere rolling on the floor, horse-heads all mixed up with jars containing quivering gold leaves, skulls lying on sheets of vellum, covered with a medley of figures and letters, thick manuscripts lying open, piled up, heedless of the brittle corners of the parchment, in short all the rubbish of science, and lying everywhere on this jumble a layer of dust and cobwebs; but there was no luminous circle of letters, no doctor in ecstasy gazing at the flaming vision as an eagle looks at the sun
it was a daunting exordium
he is bishop of amiens, is he not?
the captain, much more occupied with her than with that heap of riff-raff, was amorously rumpling her waist-band from behind
gringoire began eating ravenously
it seems to me, i tell you, that you heard the clatter of their clogs running off to the south, while you ran north
she just strode about the cell, stopping periodically to rip out handfuls of grey hair, and then tore them with her teeth
one of the boys had just said: it’s because they are going to hang a gypsy woman today
perhaps blind,  added gervaise
just now slim and curving, you glide through space like a galley without masts, or in the middle of your stars you are like a shepherd guarding his flock
he said through grinding teeth
quasimodo, shaking with excitement, followed it with his eyes
then he was transported with joy at the thought of seeing salammbo again
i don’t just know your name,  the man in the cloak went on in his sepulchral voice
from it they brought in triumph the blessed pope of fools
the inquisitive student took advantage of this to spend a few minutes examining the cell at his leisure
in the centre of the tall, gothicnumber façade of the palais was the grand staircase; up and down it flowed continuously a double stream, breaking on the central flight of steps, and then spreading out in broad waves over its two lateral flights
without waiting for the slaves they quickly undid the baskets; there they found hyacinth-coloured robes, sponges, scrapers, brushes, perfumes, and antimony pencils for painting the eyes; all this belonging to the guards, rich men accustomed to such refinements
repeated salammbo; she fell into a reverie, with her elbow resting on the ivory chair
cried the scholar in a tone as gracious as that of a hungry mastiff disturbed at its bone
beyond gades, a voyage of twenty days, there is an island covered in gold dust, greenery and birds
there was the maison-aux-piliers, opening on to the place de grève, of which we have already given the reader some idea
a clay lamp burned softly against the tent-pole, where the zaïmph shone in the panoply hanging there
more and more gaps grew in the carthaginian cohorts, their machines became stuck in the sand; finally the suffete’s litter (his great litter with its crystal pendants), which had been visible from the start, rocking among the soldiers like a ship at sea, suddenly sank from sight
the first impact of the clapper on the bronze wall made the timber frame on which it was mounted quiver
poor dear little shoe!
they broke through the attackers’ line, and began to flee in every direction, leaving the parvis heaped with their dead
all that the blood-red glow from the furnace lit up throughout the room was a jumble of horrible things
meanwhile what has become of printing?
it was the mean lamp which day and light lit up the public breviary of notre-dame, beneath its iron mesh
isn’t it true that my fleur-de-lys is adorably beautiful and you are madly in love with her?
the most obstinate penetrated the suffete’s tent; they tried to soften him by taking his hands, making him feel their toothless gums, their skinny arms, their wound scars
and their voices were lost in the explosion of instruments sounding all at the same time, to drown the cries of the victims
finally they recognized hamilcar’s trireme
right,  said gringoire, without a horse you can’t be a man
it was a joy forbidden on pain of death in the punic armies, and they raised their cup towards carthage in derision at its discipline
by working one can bend fortune
soon they were only fifty, then twenty, then only three, then two, a samnite armed with an axe and mâtho, who still had his sword
he was still laughing as he emerged into the square
all the other tollenones were rapidly in position
he was made to kneel on the circular planks, he let them do it
i could go through flames, walk over the sea!
as soon as they went into a wood, the trees burst into flames around them; when they drank from a spring, it was poisoned; they found the caves walled up where they hid to sleep
spendius found a plant with large leaves abundantly full of juice, and, declaring that it was poisonous to keep the others away, fed on it
the faces were all half hidden by the helmet visors; bronze cnemides covered all the right legs; broad cylindrical shields came down to their knees; and this fearful square mass moved as one, seemed to have an animal life and work like a machine
the mercenaries understood this; so their indignation burst out into threats and excesses
leaving behind him the tournelle civile and the tour criminelle, and following the great wall of the king’s gardens along the unpaved river bank where the mud came up to his ankles, he came to the westernmost tip of the city, and stayed for a while looking at the little island of the cow-ferryman, passeur-aux-vaches, which has since disappeared beneath the bronze horse and the pont-neuf
you must then more than once (and speaking for myself, i have spent whole days at it, the most profitable of my life) have followed from bush to bush, beside a running brook, on a sunny day, some lovely green or blue dragonfly, darting in zigzag flight, kissing the tip of every branch
then the pools of water became more frequent
then gringoire saw a pretty little white she-goat come up, nimble, lively, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hooves, a gilded collar; he had not noticed it before, for it had remained crouching up till then on a corner of the carpet, watching its mistress dance
it was the archdeacon
come up by me,  said the suffete, suspecting some fraud: how many years have you served?
others slipped up to the enemy front-lines and came to steal food from under the tents; the barbarians, quite dumbfounded, sometimes let them go back
she said, burying her face in her hands, and shivering as though bitterly cold
picture all the grotesque heads carved on the pont-neuf, those nightmares turned to stone under the hand of germain pilon, taking on life and breath, and coming one by one to stare at you with burning eyes; all the masks from the venice carnival passing one after the other before your spyglass; in a word, a human kaleidoscope
it polishes itself around you, and it is the movement of your pulsing which distributes the winds and fertile dews
however, all these nuances, all these differences affect only the surface of the buildings
mâtho still held her little hands in his; and from time to time, despite the priest’s orders, she turned her face away and shook her arms in an attempt to get rid of him
all the hounds in the pack are there!
and, addressing the torturer: have the prisoner unfastened and brought back to the hearing

the priest went on, shaking his head, that’s what learning and letters have come to now

the blessed virgin mary, at the corner of the rue mauconseil, may well have caused eustache moubon to die just to that end, and it’s silly of you to run away like that, helterskelter like a picard with a frenchman after him, leaving behind the very thing you were chasing after; and you are a fool!

this stroke of genius filled the soldiers with enthusiasm
but out of  men who had set out for furthest ethiopia with excellent camels, new wineskins, and a stock of printed cloth, only one had come back to carthage – the others having died of exhaustion or gone mad from terror in the desert – and he reported seeing, well beyond black-harousch, after the atarantes and the land of great apes, vast kingdoms where the least utensils are all gold, and a river the colour of milk, broad as a sea; forests of blue trees, spice hills, monsters with human faces, basking on rocks with eyes that spread out like flowers to look at you; then, behind lakes covered with dragons, crystal mountains supporting the sun

the barbarians did not stop: they went further on to find a narrower place
mind you don’t, maître jacques!

sometimes it suddenly broke up, extending its black swirls into the distance; an eagle had plunged into their midst, then flew off again; on the terraces, the domes, the tip of the obelisks and the pediment of the temples, sat, here and there, great birds clutching shreds of human flesh in their bloody beaks
the light from the candelabra deepened the colour of her cheeks, the gold of her clothes and the whiteness of her skin; round her waist, on her arms, her hands and toes she wore such a mass of jewellery that the mirror, like a sun, reflected the rays at her; and salammbo, standing beside taanach, leaning forward to see her, smiled at such a dazzling effect

the hydra of the romanceros bristles further on, with other hybrid forms, the vedas and the nibelungen
while they were drinking, faces plunged into the pitchers, sixty carthaginians leaped upon them, and stabbed them to death with daggers, in the back
what do you have that makes you so attached to life?
fleur-de-lys said sharply to the captain

great cries, neighing, clash of armour rose into the air, and fanfares of trumpets sounded the charge
some who had knives fell upon others
for he was so crushed by the gods’ injustice that he had no strength left for being indignant with men

he was really lost this time: the multitude clapped its hands
but it keeps its leaves in winter

the latter had a more complex mechanism; on a small column, a crossbar was fixed by its centre, to which a kind of channel came in at right angles; at the ends of the crossbar rose two pillars containing a contraption of twisted horse-hair; two beams were fastened to them holding up the ends of a rope which led down to the bottom of the channel on to a bronze plate

you were able to see her: tell me about her!
he let himself be led off to the goddess’s servants: but he came back down the hill sobbing, like someone returning from a funeral
hide me in some corner where i can see whether this woman really is the one whose name you mentioned
no sooner had the toys been spread out on the matting than the child was surprised to see the goat, one of whose miracles’ this no doubt was, pull out certain letters with its gilded hoof, and gently push them so as to arrange them in a certain order
then they advanced as far as the barbarians’ front lines and, taking them in the flank, slaughtered them wholesale
it must be said that a permanent gallows and pillory, a justice’ and a ladder’ as they were then called, standing side by side in the middle of the paving, contributed not a little to making people avert their gaze from this fatal site, where so many beings full of life and health had breathed their last; where fifty years later was to be born that saint-vallier’s fever, that sickness which is a terror of the scaffold, the most monstrous of all sicknesses, because it comes not from god but from man

you will continue with your tisane, and we shall answer for your majesty
it would be better to take them to carthage!
meanwhile the bells, now forgotten, suddenly all fell silent at the same time, to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell-ringing, who were listening to the peal in all good faith from the pont-au-change, and went away as bewildered as a dog who has been shown a bone and given a stone
at that he fell back, and salammbo was astonished at his consternation: for she was not thinking of carthage but of the sacrilege in which she had some complicity
well,  the archdeacon went on after a fresh silence, which maître jacques took care not to disturb, are you having any success?
the girl had recognized the spiteful recluse
what we call police’ today did not then exist
after a few minutes quasimodo looked round the crowd despairingly, and repeated in a still more heart-rending voice: drink!

a very pleasant existence, all things considered, he said, and very conducive to musing
you can laugh afterwards
when that was done, now calmer, she knelt down and prayed
may it please the court to condemn my client to that fine
first he had prevented the siege of carthage and massacre of the captives; then he had not profited from the victory over hanno after the defeat of utica
they broke down the doors
the chimaeras had lost their wings, the pataeci gods their arms, the bulls their silver horns – and all of them with peeling paint, inert, rotten, but full of history and still giving off the tang of voyages, like wounded soldiers seeing their masters again, seemed to say to him: here we are!
an infinite dread oppressed every breast
his companion made no reply
those are the maîtres des requêtes of the king’s household
the wicket where the bulls of the anti-pope benedict were torn up, and from whence those who had brought them set out again, mockingly decked in cope and mitre, to make amende honorable right through paris?
i see your eyes in the flames of the fire-arrows and the gilding on the shields!
to pass through a low door you must needs stoop
the hosier boldly answered: if this revolt is what i assume, you would want in vain, sire

he looked at him, and felt moved by a kind of pity
he woke her before daybreak
the goat had been trained to do this by the gypsy, who had such a rare gift for these delicate tasks that two months had sufficed for her to teach the goat to write the word phoebus with movable letters
she found it with its tail rolled round one of the silver balustrades, by the hanging bed, rubbing against it to get rid of its old, yellowing skin, while its bright, glistening body stretched out like a sword half out of its sheath
you’re lying, old woman!
but a bar of light rose up in the east
the girls whispered, dumbfounded; that’s the captain’s name!

so you’ll be able to get in
when the first preparations were complete, and it must be said to the honour of truand discipline that clopin’s orders were carried out in silence and with admirable precision, the worthy leader of the band climbed on to the parapet of the parvis and raised his gruff, raucous voice, standing turned towards notre-dame and waving his torch, the light from which, blown about by the wind and continually obscured by its own smoke, made the reddish façade of the church alternately appear and disappear from sight
as protection against elephants, mâtho set up a corps of cataphract horsemen, in which man and horse were covered in nail-studded armour of hippopotamus hide; and to protect the horses’ hooves they had shoes of woven rushes

all i have loved!
their community of existence had established deep friendships among these men
pasque-dieu!—i warn you that i’ve just been seeing king louis xi and it’s from him that i’ve caught that oath—pasque-dieu!
the nightmare image of quasimodo grinding his teeth was itself enough to bar entry
hey there, mahiet baliffre, is that where they’re going to hang her?
when the philosopher felt the boat moving, he clapped his hands and kissed djali between her horns
she said, can the sorceresses have changed my daughter into this dreadful animal?
gringoire rushed into it, hoping that his fleetness of foot would enable him to escape from the three infirm spectres clinging on to him
soon the provisions diminished
and if i am short of men, i will draw the bears down from the mountains and drive on the lions!
then they rushed with their cutlasses and spears, and beat at the gates
snuff out the children and the candles
now all they felt for their divinities was hatred and, in revenge, they tried to stop believing in them
wanting isn’t everything,  said clopin gruffly
they were talking together in whispers, with stifled laughter, like any collection of girls with a young man in their midst
there’s one can’t get his ears through!
good-day, madame,  said the boy gravely
i rose, i fled, but, alas!
do you take my horse for a gallows?
the night was very dark
he was beginning to take himself seriously as a character in a fairy tale; from time to time he looked around as if to see whether the fiery chariot hitched to two winged chimeras, for nothing else could have conveyed him so swiftly from hell to paradise, was still there
the chimneys of the houses, the crenellations of the walls, the carved roof-gables, the spire of the augustins, the tour de nesle, all these projections indenting the profile of the colossal obelisk, added to the optical illusion with their weird simulation of the jagged carvings of some fantastic, luxuriant sculpture
dom claude interrupted him: you are happy then?
the priest whom the girls had noticed on top of the north tower, leaning out over the square and so intently watching the gypsy’s dance, was indeed archdeacon claude frollo
just as quasimodo was exhausting himself in conjectures, he seemed to see the movement reappear in the rue du parvis, which runs into the cité at right angles to the front of notre-dame
indeed the rabbetna, now bereft of her veil, was as though deprived of part of her virtue
i will not help you in this odious crime
what, baptiste croque-oison, with your fine nose, are you going to risk it against that lout’s great fists!
the empire of galilee was hardly more advanced; one could just make out in its music some wretched rebec from the infancy of the musical art, still confined to re-la-mi but it was around the pope of fools that all the musical riches of the period were displayed in magnificent cacophony
drops of boiling oil were thrown at him with tubes; shards of glass were sprinkled under his feet; he went on walking
at the quieter hours, suddenly masses of people would rush along shouting; and from the top of the acropolis fires looked like crimson rags laid out over the terraces, twisting in the wind
the whole horizon was coloured red as blood
all, as they saw him go, were convinced that he would not come back
this sight abruptly changed his train of thought, and congealed the flow of his musical enthusiasm as a puff of wind congeals molten resin
everything overflowed with brine, truffles, and assa foetida
the unfortunate girl, just as she was going back into the fateful tumbril on her way to her final destination, was seized, perhaps, by some anguished longing for life
the building maintained its calm, deserted air, but something froze the truands’ courage
to demonstrate his vigilance the chief of perfumes offered the suffete an amber spoon containing a little malobathrum to taste; then pierced three indian bezoars with an awl

he went about always surrounded by a little court of bishops and abbots of noble lineage, gallant, bawdy, and good trenchermen if need be; and more than once the pious ladies of saint-germain d’auxerre, passing in the evening beneath the brightly lit windows of the bourbon residence, had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had sung them vespers in the daytime chanting to the clink of glasses the bacchic motto of benedict xii, the pope who added a third crown to the tiara: bibamus papaliter’ [let us drink papally]
she cried in a rage
the war against carthage was his personal affair; he was angry that others should become involved in it and be unwilling to obey him
it was quite an adventure
at that time anyone who was born a poet became an architect
when he had finished, dom claude took him by the hand and said to him coldly: all right
spendius, narr’havas, and mâtho sent off men to all the tribes on punic territory
it upsets my throat
if you only knew how much i love you!
meanwhile supplies, despite hamilcar’s care, dwindled terribly
and what defies explanation is that the blinder the passion, the more tenacious it is
besides, that is easier than one might think
at that despair was so intense that many people, especially women, flung themselves down, headfirst, from the top of the acropolis
and in his thirst for knowledge he had successively devoured one set of decretals after another, those of theodore [sc
then he began promptly to read them, one after the other, made a sign to maître olivier’, who appeared to be acting as his minister, to take up a pen, and without informing him of the contents of the dispatches, began in a low voice to dictate answers to them, which olivier wrote down, kneeling somewhat uncomfortably in front of the table
indignant as he was at the frauds committed against him, when he noticed bundles of nard being wrapped up for countries overseas, he ordered antimony to be mixed with it to make it heavier
hanno had finished his preparations
give it here, by god, or i’ll search you, be you as leprous as job or scabby as caesar!
wasn’t she your wife?
a large dog, solemnly sitting in the ashes, was turning a spit laden with meat before the glowing embers
she called for schahabarim and when he came no longer had anything to say to him
she understood nothing about this strange friend whom chance had given her
the furious beasts galloped through the syntagmata
i am borne away by some impulse!
it must contain a lot of nitre and sal volatile
that’s what you’ve done
thus moloch possessed carthage; he embraced the ramparts, he rolled through the streets, he devoured even the corpses
the priest stared hard at her, with a smile that she had never seen before
i want to know all i have lost, to the last shekel, to the last cab!
jacques coictier bowed deeply and said: sire, what will save you is a repercussive
she made a sign to show that she was listening
at the coronation, that same year, number, it was she who made the king of the ribalds’ bed!
thin chains went up from his fingers to his shoulders and came down behind, where men, pulling on them, brought up level with his elbows his two open hands which, as they came nearer, met against his belly; they moved several times in succession, in little jerky movements
silence all round, and attend to the chorus:
my companions and yours!
it was indeed the second accused
what does that matter to us?
maître jacques,  he cried, let fate do its work!
more than a score of times already the massive door which they were assaulting so furiously had shaken beneath the weight of their oaken battering ram multiplied by the strength of a hundred men
what punishment can you fear from the gods since you will have their strength in your hands?
he had preferred to be rebuked by her rather than distress her
then they went back northwards, aimlessly, without even knowing the roads
the clerk at once began drafting the sentence
we should stroll along covered in purple like satraps
it was none too soon
such impassivity exasperated him; he cried:
where have you got to in gratian’s decretals?
on his head he wore a kind of circular headgear, closed on top; but it was hard to tell whether it was a child’s padded bonnet or a king’s crown, the two are so much alike
women all love that
the philosopher’s forecast, as he sees human thought, volatilized by the printing press, evaporate out of its theological container
no admiration could be too great for a monument which might equally well be a king’s palace, a house of commons, a town hall, a college, a riding school, an academy, a warehouse, a lawcourt, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple, a theatre
for the second time they were retreating before him
she was unable even to utter a cry
exclaimed the duke of egypt
narr’havas, who roved about between the three armies, was just then near him
the sound of glasses, feasting, swearing, and quarrelling could be heard through the broken window panes
all this clamour attracted the cardinal’s attention
godmother,  cried bérangère, whose constantly roving eyes had suddenly looked up at the top of the towers of notre-dame, who’s that man in black up there?
one might well still have now and then, under the reign of the printing press, a column made, i suppose, by a whole army out of cannon all stuck together as, under the reign of architecture, one had iliads and romanceros, mahabharatas and nibelungen, made by a whole people from an accumulation and fusion of rhapsodies
narr’havas had surrounded them with his cavalry; the suffete meanwhile was driving them back, crushing them; and then they were beaten in advance through the loss of the zaïmph; even those who did not care for it had felt some anxiety and a sort of enfeeblement
when claude and quasimodo went out together, which frequently occurred, and were seen in each other’s company, the servant behind his master, passing through the cool, narrow, dark streets adjoining notre-dame, more than one spiteful remark, more than one ironic snatch of song, more than one rude gibe pestered them as they went by, unless, as rarely happened, claude frollo walked with head erect, showing his severe and almost august forehead to silence the mockers
the first member of the audience whom messire miles d’isliers, doctor of decretals, saw arriving every monday morning, quite out of breath, when the doors opened at the school of chef-saint-denis, was claude frollo
the surging crowd of soldiers jostled each other
meanwhile salammbo continued on her way
in the front row, bending most closely over the bed, could be seen four women who, from their grey cowls, a sort of cassock, presumably belonged to some religious sisterhood
do i get my roof?
sang the legless man
her lips trembled, her chest heaved
the negroes demanded white shells such as were used for trade in the african interior
exclaimed the gypsy with an expression of kindly pity
hence there were hundreds of contradictory forms of policing, that is to say none at all
for pity’s sake have we really drunk away all the reverend’s wallet?
for himself, he resolved to go back to carthage to collect soldiers there and start the war again
their companion was got up in much the same way, but there was something about her dress and bearing which had a whiff of the country lawyer’s wife
all to no effect
then she shook herself, and cried out in a loud, heart-rending voice: no!
the duke of egypt at the head, on horseback, with his counts on foot, holding his bridle and stirrups; behind them the egyptian men and women in no particular order, with their small children yelling on their shoulders; all of them, the duke, counts, ordinary people, in rags and tinsel
at that moment he saw the people draw aside
said the mother, there are so many sorcerers about nowadays that i think they burn them without knowing their names, you might as well try to know the name of every cloud in the sky
the high, pointed shields, stuck side by side into the turf, protected the infantry
the traders at their shop doors, the workmen who went by holding a lead ruler, the brine sellers rinsing out their baskets, the clients in the baths, the hot-drink sellers, all discussed the operations of the campaign
then he replied: no!
the barbarians were weakening; some greek hoplites threw away their arms, the others were seized with panic spendius could be seen leaning over on his dromedary, goading it with two spears in the shoulders
they surrounded hamilcar, they congratulated him; it was like brothers meeting their brother again
whatever you will,  she answered feebly, but kill me quickly
yes, knowledge meant everything to me
a wet footprint showed beyond
they ought to be attacked at once with fresh troops
passers-by going about their business did not look in through this turbulent window
that night, then, quasimodo, after glancing at his poor neglected bells, jacqueline, marie, thibault, had gone right up to the top of the north tower, and there, putting down on the leads his firmly closed dark lantern, had begun looking out over paris
but pierre l’assommeur [the slaughterman] has been slaughtered!
cried the greek, leaping up; he strode along; his eyes glinted and a strange smile creased his jackal face
then the lances looked like tall blades of grass, finally everything disappeared into a trail of dust; those soldiers who turned round towards carthage could now only see the long walls, silhouetted against the horizon with their empty battlements
she repeated several times: go away!
well, burned it then?
she has just disappeared
they were dragging it with both hands, hauling with ropes and pushing with their shoulders – for the slope rising inland from the plain, although extremely gentle, was often impracticable for machines of such prodigious weight
it was one of those spring days so sweet and lovely that all paris fills the squares and promenades to celebrate as if it were a sunday
it’s a woman, monsieur
a student, robin poussepain, i think, went up to laugh in his face, but came too near
have you made gold?
the sachette knows me slightly
the light hurt so badly that she closed her eyes
i’m afraid of the gypsy girl seeing me
help, gentlemen of the watch!
gudule made an effort and said: above all that one
in fact, hamilcar had secretly sent back to the quirites the crews of the latin vessels captured before the defection of the tyrian towns; and rome, as an exchange of courtesies, now sent back its captives
spendius repeated the same things to the gauls, the greeks, the campanians, the balearics
it was a poor, awkward, clumsy organism standing with bowed head and pleading eye before an intellect at once lofty and profound, powerful and superior
the gypsy was paying no heed to him
trouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, the archisuppôts, and the cagoux formed a horseshoe round him, with gringoire, still held bodily in rough hands, at the centre
nothing is going to make us die, for i haven’t died of joy!
he cried, clapping his hands, there’s a red glow in the sky over the cité
she asked the gypsy
[noble sir, to buy a crust of bread!
under that thin canvas sack, in january, lying naked on a granite floor, without a fire, in the shadows of a dungeon whose slanting window let in from outside only the icy wind and never the sun, she did not seem to be suffering, or even to feel
then his fears came back
utica had already asked several times for help from carthage
said the provost, how greedy she is for the rack!
narr’havas had stopped talking; salammbo, without answering, looked at him
renewed fury drove on the barbarians
an extension of his strength, an indefinite continuation of his person was partly revealed to him, and the slaves did not understand what had pacified him
the blind man ran
at his thundering voice the ranks of men closed up: even the lame stepped up their pace; in the middle of the isthmus the gap narrowed
when he learned the news, he shut himself up in his cell in the cloister
at last the houses leaped over philip-augustus’s wall, and joyfully scattered over the plain in ragged disorder, as though escaping from captivity
you are quite right to want me one day to become a graduate and sub-monitor of the collège de torchi
the little trochilus bird makes its nest in the crocodile’s mouth
jumping over the ravines and bushes, they drove the fugitives like hounds hunting hares
voices call me, a ball of fire rolls and comes up into my breast, it stifles me, i am about to die; and then something sweet, flowing from my brow down to my feet, passes over my flesh… it is a caress that enfolds me, and i feel crushed as though a god were stretched out on me
but perhaps you know of some stronger gods or some irresistible invocation?
while the pensionary of ghent and his eminence were exchanging low bows and a few words in an even lower voice, a tall man with a broad face and powerful shoulders came up so that he entered abreast with guillaume rym, looking like a mastiff beside a fox
and when they are in your city, poor and numerous among all your wealth, it does not occur to you to weaken them by the slightest division!
he announced that , gaulish mercenaries were coming, and that the king of macedonia was sending soldiers
say something to her
she was outside society, outside life, but she vaguely felt that it might not be impossible to come inside again
as he felt the king’s pulse, coictier looked more and more alarmed
none of the mercenaries knew the mountains, and marching at the head of the columns they had led on the others
a great hubbub arose below
instead of the confusion they had imagined, they found everywhere a frightening order and silence
the poor bell-ringer’s eyes filled with tears, but not one did he let fall
meanwhile, when the sun of the middle ages had finally set, when gothic genius had faded away for ever on the horizon of art, architecture became ever more dull, colourless, nondescript
i’m not asking anything from anyone, but i want my child!
it is certain that he had often been seen going along the rue des lombards and furtively entering a small house at the corner of the rue des écrivains and the rue marivault
there was continual movement within it from head to tail; for those who were at the end of the ranks ran up to the front, and the latter, from weariness or because of the wounded, fell back
saying which he pointed his finger at the little bearded hungarian, who had accosted gringoire with his facitote caritatem’ and who, knowing no other language, observed with surprise the bad temper of the king of tunis venting itself on him
the student hardly noticed,

let her die, that lovely, sweet, adorable creature, needful for the light of the world, more divine than god?
there was a feeling of successive ages and, as it were, memories of forgotten lands
the parks were battered, the streams dried up, the prison doors open
come and take it
you look like that golden sheep the duke of burgundy wears round his neck
that is when the republic will take its revenge!
mâtho had relapsed into his gloom: his legs hung down to the ground, and the grass continually rustled as it flicked against his boots
they admired it, they execrated it, they would have liked to destroy it and at the same time to live there
at that the carthaginians broke out with murmuring against the suffete’s partiality for the mercenaries
they are about to give a peremptory flogging to maître quasimodo, bell-ringer to my brother, monsieur the archdeacon of josas, a weird bit of oriental architecture, with a dome for a back, and twisted columns for legs!
in closing it had cut off the one ray of light and joy which still penetrated quasimodo’s soul
it was covered in green silk, and at its centre had a large, green, glass bead, in imitation of an emerald
in number quasimodo was about number, claude frollo about number; the one had grown up, the other had aged

take care, la falourdel, that he doesn’t bang on your door
he installed himself in the stern, and the girl, in whom the stranger inspired an indefinable anxiety, came to sit pressed closely against the poet
they came to the cypress avenue, where they were lost among the crowd, who plied them with questions
he did not know, but at any rate he was a phoebus, and that magical name was enough to make the archdeacon stealthily follow the two carefree friends, listening to what they said and watching their slightest gesture with anxious attention
the girl hurled herself upon him like a raging tigress, and thrust him on to the stairs with supernatural strength
irreligious and superstitious, like any soldier who is only a soldier, when he questioned himself about this adventure, he was not happy about the goat, about the odd way he had first met la esmeralda, about the equally strange manner in which she had revealed to him the secret of her love, finally about the bogey-monk
i’d like to know what use a mill is to a bishop!
all for you, enchantress—to be more worthy of your hell!
paris since louis xi has not grown by much more than a third
during her absence a neighbour had seen two gypsy women sneak up there with a bundle in their arms, then come down again, closing the door behind them, and run away
it meant that he always had a bed and some bread
there were two or three little windows in its walls, so densely latticed with thick iron bars that the glass could not be seen
we had women to sweep out our stables in drepanum
a very pure, white light brought out vividly to the eye all the different planes which the hundreds of houses present to the east

maître,  said one of them, beckoning him closer …
he did not follow out his thought to the end, stopping at the limit where it terrified him
the royal carillon of the palais casts in all directions respendent trills, on to which fall at regular intervals the heavy strokes from the belfry of notre-dame, striking sparks from them like the anvil under the hammer
first they described their good treatment by the suffete; the barbarians listened enviously, although they despised them

i can still save you!
schahabarim, without answering, continued to walk; and crossing the whole enclosure step by step he arrived beneath the legs of the colossus, then touched it on each side with outstretched arms, a solemn formula of worship
but you are a terrible mistress!… it is through you that monsters are produced, fearsome spectres, lying dreams; your eyes eat up the stones of buildings, and monkeys are sick every time you are renewed

in the twinkling of an eye the enclosed area of the parvis was empty
he had just done his last rounds in the church
when you were talking to me just now it was like music!
it was as though he were hearing the song through her eyes
the people whom he had joined were walking and jostling each other in silence
basically gringoire, like monsieur despréaux, was not a very passionate man’
she looked at him gravely
but there was enough to do with thickening up the wall and making it as high as possible without bothering about them; they were abandoned; all of them perished; and though they were generally hated, this caused great revulsion against hamilcar
the poor student’s death filled the crowd with burning fury
so he was taking the liberty of abducting you, as if you were made for beadles!
they parted before him
that day there was to be a bonfire on the place de grève, a maypole set up at the chapel of braque, and a mystery play at the palais de justice
it meant death for carthage, victory for the barbarians
farewell to any vigour, originality, life, intelligence
he distrusted the odd ways of women
i know very well why
but you must surely realize,  went on kindly oudarde, that yesterday was a holiday
however the python had fallen sick again; and as salammbo on the contrary seemed to be cured, old taanach rejoiced, convinced that as it wasted away it was taking on its mistress’s languor
and when you looked past the bridges, on which the roofs were plainly turning green, mouldering before their time in the vapours from the water, and turned your gaze to the left, towards the university, the first building to strike the eye was a large, low bunch of towers, the petit châtelet, whose yawning gateway swallowed up the end of the petit-pont
in the middle of this round table of beggary, clopin trouillefou, like the doge of this senate, like the king of this peerage, like the pope of this conclave, dominated, first from being perched aloft on his barrel, then with an indefinable look, proud, fierce, and formidable, which made his eyes glint and refined on his savage profile the brutish character of the truand race
maître charmolue displayed an intimidating register, and began reading with a wealth of gesture and the exaggerated accents of advocacy a latin oration in which all the evidence of the charges was stacked upon ciceronian periphrases flanked by quotations from plautus, his favourite comic author
what used to be worth a shekel of silver is now worth three shekels of gold, and the farmland abandoned during the war produces nothing!
it was as if the sibilant voice had woken mâtho up, he seemed not to understand; spendius went on:
he looked around him too, but in so lifeless and sleepy a way that the women only pointed him out to each other to scoff
meanwhile, the unknown man who had so magically changed the storm into calm’ as our dear old corneille puts it, had modestly returned to the obscurity of his pillar, where he could no doubt have remained invisible, motionless and silent as before, had he not been drawn away by two young women who, from their place in the front row of spectators, had observed his conversation with michel giborne/jupiter
the crash of all the great double petards on st john’s day, a volley from a score of arquebuses, the detonation of that famous serpentine in the billy tower, which killed seven burgundians in one go on sunday, number december number during the siege of paris, the explosion of all the gunpowder in the magazine at the porte du temple, none of that could have split his eardrums more brutally at that solemn and dramatic moment than those few words from an usher’s mouth: his eminence monseigneur the cardinal de bourbon
the people of carthage began to hurl, over the numidians, spits, skewers, hammers; men of whom the consuls had been afraid died from sticks thrown by women; the punic people was exterminating the mercenaries
only noon had been punctual
the noises from the distant town were lost in the murmur of the waves
dom claude’s fame had spread far and wide
you don’t know where she is?
but he shouted all the louder; and in the name of their gods, he called on them to take him to the schalischim, bécause he had something to confide in him on which their safety depended
i certainly hope,  la gaultière went on, that no one will apply for it
besides, every form, every deformity even, in them has a sense which renders it inviolable

(most of these privileges, be it noted in passing, and there were better ones than that, had been wrung out of the king by revolts and mutinies
but he stopped, as though struck by a sudden idea
give me your orders!
he answered that he had sent a fleet by gades and thymiamata to try and reach eziongabar, rounding the southern horn and the spice promontory
and the priests of proserpine, conforming out of terror to carthage’s need, mumbled the eleusinian formula: pour down rain!
have you murdered them with the soldiers?
well now, gentle captain, what has brought on such a spate of eloquence?
when it was quite dark, hamilcar gently picked him up and without a torch went down the galley staircase
right then, sack the place!
bogeyman-monk, phantom, superstitions, all was forgotten at that moment
on his head was one of those overloaded fifteenth-century helmets, which would scare the enemy with the monsters on their peak
their plans are known!
lotus flowers surrounded a fountain, where fish swam, similar to salammbo’s; then, at the back, against the temple wall, spread a vine with branches of glass and fruit of emerald: the precious stones shining through the painted columns made patterns of light on the sleeping feces
they could even, the man from carthage added, come a little closer, to a place he pointed out, where they would find food

after his victory he should have destroyed the mercenaries
he said, seizing this pretext to come closer again to the lovely creature whom he had just frightened away
until morning the barbarians pushed each other in serried ranks from one end of the plain to the other
the crowd was teeming around her; from time to time a man got up in a red and yellow tabard would push them into a circle, then go back and sit on a chair a few feet from the dancer, and take the goat’s head in his lap
you watched coldly as i wept!
cried all the girls, clapping their hands
however author and public for long afterwards felt resentment towards the cardinal
he did not utter a word; only, at long intervals, a sob violently shook his whole body, but it was a sob without tears, like summer lightning which makes no sound
he hoped that this shared infirmity would arouse maître florian’s interest in favour of the condemned man
he did not have the strength to finish, and hamilcar stopped, quite astonished at such grief
she pulled her back violently, digging her nails into the girl’s neck
and the patricians deplored their contribution of fourteen shekels, the syssitia their , kikars of gold; those who had given nothing complained as loudly as the others
but the carthaginians had piled up such a mass of material inside that the gates did not open
it suddenly caught the chest of the bronze colossus, which was divided into seven compartments closed by grills
they creaked, and that was all
gringoire turned to him majestically
it was a lamp burning in a shell on the pedestal of a statue wearing the cabiri cap
do you think their faces and their songs still touch me?
meanwhile the balearic slingsmen who had gone round the corner of the palace in order to plunder more easily were halted by
that he had seen in the street, passing by beneath his window, some ribald fellows making fun of him, a gang of four of them going along with no shirts under their doublets, no crowns to their hats, wallet and bottle at their side?
the suffete answered that a whole caravan of virgins was awaited for them: it was a long way, and would take another six moons
what more can i say, mesdamoiselles?
then the instruments fell silent
you are the stronger
then he asked where were three boxes of psagas, intended for his use
the gypsy sat up gracefully on the officer’s saddle, rested her hands on the young man’s shoulders and gazed at him for a few seconds, as though enchanted by his good looks and the timely assistance he had just brought her

in fact the servants had abandoned everything, believing that their master would never come back
he had not finished when narr’havas leapt up, pulled a javelin from his belt, and, resting his right foot on the table, hurled it at mâtho
they both went off striding down towards the cité
she thinks the same as you about these gypsy vagabonds who play their tambourines and tell fortunes
will you shut up, you cicada from hell?
but if rabbetna triumphed, if the zaïmph was returned and carthage delivered, what did a woman’s life matter?
no one looked at her as did a young numidian chief sitting at the captains’ table, amongst the soldiers of his nation
her long eyelashes were lowered, shading her crimson cheeks
but this final blow was too harsh
the carthaginians pushed them and, at sunrise, they projected into the plain like the steps of some huge ruined stairway
but who cast down the two rows of statues?
it is the ant-hill of all intellect
we must, however, give our friend jehan his due
but the springs would dry up by themselves; the food would run out, the catapults would become worn out; the mercenaries, ten times more numerous, would finally triumph
and he refused to appear before the princess
she repeated crazily: there’s no one here
frozen with terror, they stood undecided
today it’s a morality specially composed for madame the princess of flanders
jackals will lie down in your palaces, the plough will turn up your graves
when they had passed through the crowd out of the square, a horde of curious and idle people tried to follow them

they resumed their journey
the king turned round so sharply that he scraped the floor matting with the legs of his chair
the acropolis hill, in the centre of byrsa, was covered over with a litter of monuments
this scene of disorder, buried up till then in darkness, had suddenly flared up with light
they amounted to so many zones on a graduated scale of horror
the moon was shining bright
who set up their tolls all over the countryside, their justice and their executioner at every crossroads among our people?
at last day broke; and round them they saw a great white wall, rising sheer
whence three absolutely different aspects
a poor innocent philosopher, floundering in the darkness of calamity, with his empty fob ringing upon his hollow belly?
from time to time he would cough
it was in order to make an end of it, and from despair, that he had set the libyans’ camp on fire
gringoire’s three captors led him before this barrel, and the whole bacchanalia fell silent for a moment, except for the cauldron with the child inside
louis xi, that tireless workman who began the widespread demolition of the feudal edifice, continued by richelieu and louis xiv to the advantage of the monarchy, and completed by mirabeau to the advantage of the people, louis xi had indeed tried to break up this network of lordships which covered paris, by forcibly imposing right across it two or three ordinances of general police
every time i see it i feel happy
he asked for giddenem, the slave master; and this personage appeared, parading his dignity in the richness of his dress; for his tunic, split down the sides, was of fine purple, heavy rings pulled his ears down, and a golden thong, joining the strips of material wound round his legs, ran from his ankles up to his hips
everywhere he saw only eyes staring wide, as if to devour him, chattering teeth, shaking fists, and salammbo’s curses resounded as they were multiplied
he clicked his tongue and the man with the cutlass went on rapidly:
as for him, he had never known such a total blockade; he could hear his stomach rumbling in surrender, and thought it very unfair that ill fate should starve his philosophy into capitulation
upon my soul,  said dom claude at last, as he grasped the other man’s hand, i am glad to see you looking so well
the amethysts and topazes of the ceiling made quivering patches of light here and there, and as she walked salammbo turned her head a little to see them
and i will set you in good positions, very high, among the clouds, so that you can be near the eagles!
she’ll go out in your clothes; you’ll stay behind in hers
you could hear beside the heavy doric dialect the celtic syllables ringing out like battle chariots, and ionian endings clashed with desert consonants, harsh as jackal-cries
she went so pale that taanach stopped
don’t worry,  gringoire answered
the men from the north were swollen with a livid puffiness, while the africans, more sinewy, looked as though they had been smoked and were already going dry
thin threads, pulled from marine plants, hung between flax from egypt, greece, tap-robana, and judaea; madrepores, like large bushes, bristled at the foot of the walls; and there was an all-pervading indefinable smell, given out by perfumes, leather, spices, and ostrich plumes tied up in big bundles right up to the ceiling
sergeants of the wand, you’ll take this rascal to the pillory of the grève, you’ll flog him, and turn him round for an hour
and resting on both hands she leaned out trembling all over
phoebus, however, was not dead
claude, you are the fly too!—you were flying towards knowledge, the light, the sun, your only concern was to reach the open air, the broad daylight of eternal truth; but in your rush towards the dazzling window that opens on to that other world, the world of clarity, intelligence, and knowledge, blind fly, demented doctor, you did not see the subtle spider’s web stretched by destiny between the light and you, you rushed into it headlong, wretched fool, and now you struggle, with your head smashed in and your wings ripped off, in the iron grip of fate’s antennae!—maître jacques!
their cries grew louder
i’m determined to hear no more of that
their army was about , men, and several times they had the pleasure of seeing the carthaginians retreat
what did it matter in any case!
i hope that settles it
a girl was humming:
the hangman took advantage of that moment swiftly to break the grip of the arms with which she clasped the condemned girl
a murmur of satisfaction broke out among the crowd
the gallery of the kings of france today stands about sixty feet above the pavement
the provincial was certainly about to lose her temper for the honour of her pillory
he spent long hours looking at the aqueduct, and so persistently that he no doubt wanted to mislead the carthaginians as to his real intentions
the balearic fastened a pick and mallet to it and went back
the person whom he designated by that name took back the register from his hands and began again reading aloud:
they dozed with their eyes only half closed
he had seen her and her goat take the rue de la coutellerie; he had taken the rue de la coutellerie
they are your good friends, the barbarians!
the churches had their sanctity to protect them
however he did not talk of the rabbet
the former slave practised for several days shooting arrows at flamingoes on the lake
said robin poussepain, still aching and bruised all over from his fall
show me that shoe,  said the gypsy, giving a start
he threw himself at the arm holding the cutlass crying: quasimodo!
such doors are only ever used for entrance
truth to tell, he was afraid of being hanged
these , men were crammed into the kind of hippodrome which the mountain formed round them
i know a finer one,  she said
then she felt horror rise to the roots of her hair, and she heard the dismal laugh of the recluse whispering: ha!
o god, god, it would have been better never to have given her to me at all if you were going to take her back so soon
he answered, hitting his head with clenched fists:
it was her advocate
it would seem that claude frollo had experienced it
you’ll be called the blind man
the chain has been stretched across the street all night, and the chain-keeper has seen no one go by
scraps of matting closing the doors beat against the walls
the great star went down into the sea as the beating lessened; at the last palpitation it disappeared
the three women thought she was dead
this is the little girl you won’t reject, who has come, come in person, to find you
you are wearing them out!
the escort lined up on either side
there was one on each rung
the trapdoor opened, a light reappeared
so it’s all over!
the barbarians established at hippo-zarytus saw his army as it went down the mountain
but the pontiff of eschmoûn rose, and with knees together, elbows held in, erect and with hands half open, he said:
how sad it is to think that all that once existed and now there’s nothing of it left!
besides, he was a man of changeable moods and, need it be said?
poor grain of millet given over by human justice to be ground in the fearful mills of torture!
but the avoyer scharnachtal rushed on the fine duke with his club and his people, and when they clashed with these peasants in their buffalo skins, the shining burgundian army shattered like a pane of glass hit by a stone
brother, you were so right when you told me: jehan, jehan, cessat doctorum doctrina, discipulorum disciplina [the teaching of the teachers, the discipline of the disciples has slackened off]
it was a rather long climb
it’s triton,  she answered
thus the unfortunate man’s fever or madness had reached such a degree of intensity that the outside world had become for him nothing but a kind of visible, palpable, terrifying apocalypse
round his neck could be seen gleaming the golden cockleshells of the collar of saint-michel
a wooden disc gave way, and there soon appeared along the length of the corridor several of the large lids which sealed the pits in which grain was kept
but the greek raised his voice, and recounting the crimes of hanno, whom he knew to be barca’s enemy, trying to move him with details of their suffering and memories of their loyalty, he spoke for a long time, rapidly, insidiously, even violently; in the end he forgot himself, carried away by the fervour of his mind
here louis xiv’s palaces, long barracks for courtiers, stiff, glacial, boring
but whether from fear or hunger they all took their way homewards and disappeared
the poor devil clearly had a choice of nicknames
the monstrous bell whinnied, panting beneath him, and then it was no longer the bourdon of notre-dame or quasimodo, it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest; vertigo riding on sound; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper; a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a kind of horrible astolfo carried away on a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze
there was another fine part, that of dom pedro, king of mesopotamia
the archdeacon was the first to break the silence
now, giving the great bell in marriage to quasimodo was like giving juliet to romeo
her chin rested on her knees, which her two crossed arms held tightly against her chest
i’ve lost my notebooks
the archdeacon looked at him gloomily
they reminded each other, with roars of greedy delight, of the fine silver crosses, the fine brocade copes, the fine silver-gilt tombs, the great splendours of the choir, the dazzling festivals, christmas sparkling with torches, easter brilliant with sunshine, all those spendid solemnities at which shrines, candlesticks, ciboria, tabernacles, reliquaries made the altars look as though embossed with a covering of gold and diamonds
he picked himself up and reached the water’s edge
i’ll let you know,  he stammered in a barely articulate voice
this confused mass of corpses filled the entire mountain-side from top to bottom
our philosopher stood dumbfounded, his eyes passing bemused from the goat to the girl in turn
pardon me, my lord king of tunis,  replied gringoire, fighting every inch of the ground
then, when the barbarians had gone, spendius went round the plain, riding a punic stallion and with his slave leading a third horse
this sounded most doleful in the dark, and their faces paled as they looked at one another
la esmeralda picked up the ill-fated letters in an instant, beckoned to djali, and went out by one door as fleur-de-lys was carried out by the other
independently of these two main streets, diametrically cutting across the width of paris from side to side, common to the whole capital, town and university each had their own particular main street, running lengthways across them, parallel with the seine, intersecting the two arterial streets at right angles
parliament was wary of bishops, and when it came to a clash between the two robes, the magistrate’s cimarra was not evenly matched against the cassock
the population was jealous of the new-carthaginians who had been promised full citizenship; and even the ligurians, who had fought so bravely, were associated with the barbarians, and equally cursed; their race became a crime, a complicity
then stay here,  she went on imperiously, and let’s watch to the end
she put her daughter down, for she was still carrying her, in a corner of the cell which could not be seen from outside
he stretched out his arm towards the cité
spendius, leaping from terrace to terrace and jumping over hedges and streams, had escaped from the gardens
wondered spendius; and as he was expecting to benefit from any disorder, he was grateful to narr’havas for the future perfidy of which he suspected him
the man who admires caesar blames catilina
the burghers let the wind blow out the candles in their windows, and let their dogs stray; the iron chains were only put up when the city was under siege; the prohibition on carrying daggers changed nothing but the name of the rue coupe-gueule which became the rue coupe-gorge, an obvious sign of progress
henriet cousin grasped the girl round the middle, under her lovely shoulders
they were looked on as cruel masters, to be appeased with supplications and bribed by presents

he has half risen from his immense armchair, his clenched fists are resting on the table and he is gazing, curious and terrified, at a great luminous circle, composed of magic letters, shining on the far wall, like the solar spectrum in a camera obscura
he wept with rage over all these mysteries of love, now profaned, soiled, exposed, withered for ever
he found himself in the gallery with the fearsome bell-ringer, alone, separated from his companions by a vertical wall number feet high
more than once, in choir, during the office, the occupant of the neighbouring stall had heard him mingling unintelligible parentheses into the plainchant ad omnem tonum [in every tone]
they wore white woollen cloaks, long daggers, leather necklets, wooden earrings, boots of hyena skin; and they stayed at the entrance leaning on their lances like shepherds resting
lord jesus, how beautiful she is!
someone cried out that he had been poisoned
watch out, any pregnant women!
that resplendent figure standing out like something luminous in the light of the sun itself!
she draws all her fecundity from the other!
and how do you earn your living?
the hangman, who had not loosed the girl, started up the ladder again
said gringoire and fell back on the pont-au-change
it’s for you to wish it
with decretals digested, he threw himself into medicine and the liberal arts
the trampled earth was covered with pools of red
meanwhile, ever since tristan had seen her daughter and all hope was lost, the recluse had not uttered a word
the quay at that point ran upwards
the numidians, covered in white cloaks, let out loud cries, raised their arms as their knees gripped their prancing stallions, turned them round suddenly, then disappeared
it was already close on seventeen years since he had, on number november number, in the year of the comet,number received from the king this fine post of provost of paris, reputed more of a lordship than an office
the microscope had not yet been invented, either for material things of for those of the spirit
the effect of this proposal on gringoire can easily be imagined; he had seen his life running out and had begun to let it go
then they did not dare look, they could no longer see her, but they heard kisses and sighs without number mixed with heart-rending cries and dull thuds as of a head banging against a wall
he appears: he’s a hunchback
gringoire, following the gypsy, had entered the impenetrable maze of alleys, crossroads, and cul-de-sacs surrounding the ancient burial place of the holy innocents, which resembled nothing so much as a skein of thread tangled up by a cat
the other went on: god’s head!
you are lying,  said the shadow coldly
i want to keep my child!
hence innumerable optical illusions, innumerable aberrations of judgement, innumerable diversions for his errant thoughts, now wild, now idiotic
the student boldly entered
they clutched each other lying on their bellies like wrestlers
these objects were of so little value that the hangman had no doubt not wanted them
the townsfolk are lighting their candles and god lights up his stars
i’d like to be wholly animal, like that goat
when do we start?
bravely spoken, sir gilles lecornu, master skinner and furrier of the king’s wardrobe!
then, at the fence, with a leap it jumped into a palm-tree
finally mâtho looked up at him, his eyes full of distress
there were also, passim, hebrew scribbles, of which jehan, who had very little greek, understood nothing, and it was all crossed, here, there, and everywhere by stars, human or animal figures, and intersecting triangles, which went quite a long way to making the wall of the cell, covered in scrawls, look like a sheet of paper over which a monkey had been tracing a pen full of ink
trade is incompatible with nobility
quasimodo came up stealthily behind him to see what he was looking at
how happy we could be!
spendius treated his men gently, dreamed of plans; he tried to remember stratagems which he had heard about in the course of his travels
mother, it was the dog
i know lots of very attractive tricks to teach your goat; for instance, how to mimic that damned pharisee the bishop of paris, whose mill-wheels splash passers-by the whole length of the pont-aux-meuniers

dear cousin, i have been recalled to garrison duty
it was a miracle from the good lord
these words, uttered in a tone of reproachful surprise, drew the attention of the archdeacon once more to this unknown stranger, from whom, truth to tell, it had not been fully diverted for a moment since he had crossed the cell’s threshold
i tell you it wasn’t!
a gigantic cross had been put up at the gate
his eyes staring fixedly at hers upset her; and this unease, this repugnance increased so sharply that salammbo made an effort not to cry out
but he was fidgeting with shame and annoyance; salammbo, who was eagerly helping him, was as pale as he was
i don’t know your mahé fédy, but he’s a nasty man

as they became progressively more drunk they increasingly recalled the injustice of carthage
i do not think that there can be anything in the world happier than the thoughts awakened in a mother’s heart at the sight of her child’s little shoe

fair cousin,  fleur-de-lys answered in vexed tones, i’ve told you three times already

some had stopped suffering, and whiled away the hours by relating to each other the dangers from which they had escaped
go in there, my dear fellow,  he said to his companion
it must be said, in praise of the age-old good sense of curious parisians, that the majority of this crowd was making for the bonfire, which came very seasonably, or the mystery, to be performed in the sheltered and enclosed great hall of the palais, and that, by common consent, the curious left the poor maypole, with its scanty garlands, to shiver all alone under the january sky in the cemetery of the chapel of braque

i have climbed the steps of eschmoûn, god of the planets and the intelligences; i have slept beneath the golden olive-tree of melkarth, patron of the tyrian colonies; i have pushed at the doors of baal-khamon, pioneer and fertilizer; i have sacrificed to the underground cabiri, to the gods of the woods, the winds, the rivers and the mountains: but they are all too remote, too lofty, too unfeeling, do you understand?

i do not believe in astrology
how old were you when you came to france?
claude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself, thought he was seeing with his living eyes the steeple of hell; the countless lights distributed along the whole height of the horrifying tower appeared to him like so many openings into the huge inner furnaces; the voices and murmurs coming from it, like so many cries, so many death-rattles
the hairs that are missing from your whores’ heads we find in your omelettes

the two of them lying like that upon the ground, the mother on top of her daughter, made a pitiable sight

it was really fine
no,  mahiette answered
where is she then?
according to spendius, they should carefully keep their present position and starve out the punic army
salammbo turned round, a finger to her lips, as a sign to be discreet and still
the master, who knew these tricks, took a horn full of balm, brought it close to the coals and then tipped it over his robe; a brown patch appeared, so it was a fraud
two more days passed
why are those rascals making that infernal noise, like men possessed?
as soon as they reached the entrance to the courtyard their bearing became calm again

it had been prepared to that end early that morning; its rich slab of marble, scored by the heels of the law clerks, bore a frame of scaffolding of a considerable height, the upper surface of which, visible from every part of the hall, was to serve as the stage, while the inside, screened by tapestries, was to be used as a dressing room for the actors

so you fear them more than me!
meanwhile the spell was gradually working, your dance whirled round in my brain, i felt the mysterious malefice taking effect within me, all that should have been vigilant in my soul fell asleep, and like those who die in the snow i enjoyed letting sleep come

my pretty little daughter!
you will fall, carthage!
it is true that no one was less interested in monuments than our good onlookers of the middle ages, and they cared very little about the beauty of a pillory

it was becoming intolerable
suddenly she stopped, and they stayed looking at each other open-mouthed
each race as it passed by wrote its line in the book; it erased the old romanesque hieroglyphs on the frontispieces of the cathedrals, and at the very most the dogma remains still visible here and there through the new symbolism overlaying it
that soul fell into darkest night
but when the bell-ringer, dishevelled and panting, put her down in the cell of refuge, when she felt his great hands undo the cord which was bruising her arms, she experienced the kind of shock which wakes up passengers with a start when their ship grounds in the middle of a dark night
then a scruple worried him
but it is not so

he went red, he went white, then he loosed her and looked at her with a sombre expression
he looked her up and down, holding her between his legs, and repeated:

zarxas ran up, knocked him down and plunged a dagger into his throat; pulling it out, he flung himself upon the wound – and with his mouth glued to it, with grunts of joy and spasms which shook him from head to foot, he pumped out the blood with all his might; then he quietly sat down on the corpse, lifted up his face and threw back his head to breathe more freely, like a deer which has just drunk from a stream, and in a shrill voice intoned a balearic song, a vague tune full of extended, broken, alternating modulations, like answering echoes in the mountains; he called on his dead brothers and invited them to a feast; then he dropped his hands in his lap, slowly lowered his head and wept

and putting their weight on the stake mâtho had brought, they managed to dislodge one of the slabs
gringoire buried his face in his hands, not being fortunate enough to have a cloak to hide his head like timanthes’ agamemnon
the ruins came down through the breaches in the walls on to the middle of the plain; right in the background, between the shores of the gulf, the elephants’ corpses, driven by the breeze, collided, like an archipelago of black rocks floating on the water
the guards of the legion, in their gold-scaled armour, formed the first line, with their great horses without manes, or hair, or ears, and with a silver horn in the middle of their foreheads to make them look like rhinoceros
only the flemings and the rabble remained
yes,  the gypsy answered
tristan clapped him on the shoulder: you make a good cat!
and in terror buried her head between her shoulders, like a sheep waiting for the butcher’s club to fall
they tied the goat’s hooves together, and the king’s attorney resumed the thread of his eloquence
in tents and houses there was the same desire, the same anguish; everyone was wondering what was delaying hamilcar
the egyptians banged away on their balafos and african tambourines
after running at full pelt for some time, with no idea where he was going, rushing round many a street corner, stepping over many a gutter, crossing many an alley, cul-de-sac, crossroads, seeking an escape route and passage through all the twists and turns of the old cobbles of the halles, exploring in his panic what the beautiful latin of the charters calls tota via, cheminum et viaria [every road, pathway, and thoroughfare], our poet suddenly stopped, first because he was out of breath, then because he was pulled up short by a dilemma which had just occurred to him
for many of them it was the first time they had seen a mercenary camp
at clypea he had received three thousand gauls
whether he be called brahmin, magus, or pope, in the hindu, egyptian, or romanesque masonry it is always the priest, nothing but the priest, of whom one is aware
they began to run, set fire to others
louis xi went back to his seat, and said with a smile: ah!
you see, my little girl,  the recluse went on, punctuating each word with kisses, you see, i’ll love you dearly
he felt very near the underground spirits
i thought they were the six white geese sainte-geneviève pays the town for the fief of roogny
when he entered, his father and mother had been dead since the day before
this sight of carthage annoyed the barbarians
to think that they had come close to hanging the bailiff’s sergeants!
the saxon architect was just completing the first pillars of the nave when the pointed arch arriving from the crusades installed itself victoriously on those broad romanesque capitals designed only for round arches
next day he opened the pits where he kept corn; his intendants gave it to the people
his illness, eating away his lips and nostrils, had scooped out a large hole in his face; from ten paces one could see right down his throat, and he knew himself to be so hideous that, like a woman, he wore a veil over his head
pearls of different colours fell down in large bunches from her ears on to her shoulders and down to her elbows
she put her head out of the window and quickly withdrew it
flamingo wings, mounted on black-coral branches, lay about among the purple cushions and tortoiseshell combs, cedar-wood boxes, ivory spatulas
another crowd was growing around our old friend the valiant king of tunis, who was armed to the teeth
hamilcar continued on foot, alone, for the meetings of the elders were, in extraordinary circumstances, always secret, and members made their way there mysteriously
continuing his advance mâtho thought he could make out punic standards, for unmoving horses’ heads appeared in the air, fixed to the top of stacked shafts that were invisible; and further off he heard a great hubbub, a noise of song and clinking cups
she was very beautiful at that moment
all communication had been severed between his dramatic knot and its resolution
once the needs of worship have been met and ensured, architecture can do whatever it chooses
a ladder had indeed been set up by the permanent gibbet, and the executioner was busy adjusting the chains, rusted by the rain
the officer, who was as handsome as a noble lord, comes down again with me
it was not empty
this royal barber had three names
white slime ran from their nostrils, and their limbs were stiff, as if the night chill had frozen them all
he murmured to himself, she must be cold by now!
and seeing the profound stillness of his whole body, barely stirring at intervals in an involuntary shudder, like a tree in the breeze, his elbows, set more stiffly than the marble on which they rested, the petrified smile contorting his features, one would have said that nothing was still alive in claude frollo except his eyes
i have done nothing to you
for after my death i shall see those great men, pythagoras among philosophers, hecataeus among historians, homer among poets, olympus among musicians
you would be done for
this was, you may remember, one of the goat’s most charming talents
rome scorned the mercenaries’ overtures in sardinia, and would not even recognize as subjects the inhabitants of utica
i have found my child!

here it is an insurrection
how rents are going up!
you have done well, iddibal!
in the gypsy’s place, on the same carpet whose pattern of arabesques had been concealed a moment before by the capricious movements of her dance, all the archdeacon could see was the man in red and yellow who, to earn a few coins in his turn, was parading round the circle, elbows on hips, head thrown back, face scarlet, neck extended, with a chair held between his teeth
i have worked in the quarries and i have drunk massic wine in a boat that i owned, under a golden canopy, like a ptolemy
you had that much effrontery, maître pierre?
after all, the poor girl only sulked at him with great reluctance
we want to know why you did not come back to carthage?
the king violently interrupted
how did you manage, then, to escape from quasimodo’s clutches?
to have taken her from me like that, you can never have watched me with her, when i warmed her at my fire and she was so happy, when she smiled at me as she sucked at my breast, when i walked her little feet all the way up my chest to my lips!
the good wax candle has gone out, and all i have left is a nasty tallow wick smoking in my nose
there, in the middle of the pavement—it was noon—bright sunshine—a creature was dancing
he walked on a few steps, and noticed the two screech-owls, that is dom claude and maître jacques charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a sculpture in the portal
with hanno’s camp turned upside down, he had come back at them
she crushed her nails against the precious stones on her breast
how much is it, this roof of yours?
he said between his teeth
amid the dust the heavy millstones turned, that is two superimposed porphry cones, the upper one, with a funnel on it, turning on the lower, driven by stout bars
they fell upon the slaves; an appalling clamour went up and a dizzy whirlwind of destruction swept over the drunken army
and spendius, appearing terrified in the gap in the wall between the clay pots, cried diese words:
and next year, if god and our lady (here he raised his hat) grant us life, we’ll be drinking our tisane out of a pewter mug!
his assistants, two square-faced gnomes, in leather aprons and canvas breeches, were moving the ironware about on the coals
it is a transitional building
look at all those fine black copes!
after much talking the following measures were decided on and immediately put into execution
they began drinking again

the recluse did not want to deny everything, for fear of arousing suspicion, and replied in a tone of surly sincerity: if you’re talking about a tall girl they gave me to hold just now, i can tell you that she bit me and i let her go
it was this: since he could not escape the pope of fools, jehan fourbault’s banners, may bundles, squibs, and petards, he would boldly plunge into the very heart of the festivities and go to the place de grève
mâtho went away, making a sign to the others to hurry
in fact salammbo did not speak of gisco; because, as words have an effective power of their own, curses reported against someone might turn against the speaker; and she said nothing of her desire to murder mâtho, for fear of being blamed for not giving way to it
maître coppenole is putting me right
that crowd had been led to expect some sort of execution from the presence of the four sergeants posted since nine in the morning at each corner of the pillory, doubtless not a hanging, but a whipping, an ear-cropping, in a word, something; that crowd had swollen so rapidly that the four sergeants, hemmed in too closely, had more than once needed to compress’ it, as the expression then went, by laying about them with their cudgels and backing their horses into it
to love a woman!
musnier, we’ll burn your books
then, addressing the archdeacon: you have a nimble touch, dom claude, and hippocrates is hardly more of a problem to you than a nut to a monkey
if i move she comes forward; when i stop, she rests!
hideous weapons had inflicted complicated wounds
every town in the middle ages, and up until louis xii every town in france, had its places of asylum
clopin trouillefou had placed himself at the apex, with the duke of egypt, our friend jehan, and the boldest of the sabouleux
swear on your mother’s womb,  the archdeacon repeated violently, that you haven’t laid so much as a finger on that creature
suppose there’s a sudden puff of wind?
all eyes turned to the tribune reserved for the flemish envoys
his unwonted clemency was a by no means unimportant sign of it
the jealous girl interrupted him: who’s that?
meanwhile a man in white was walking on the edge of the rampart, impassible and indifferent to the death around him
as soon as they were alone, autharitus spoke up for the comrades who had been sacrificed, and zarxas said to spendius:
they came to the camp, without collars or belts, in open sandals, like neighbours
phoebus’ life, that meant everything
the barbarians stopped laughing and for a long time were seized by amazement
some people ate a lot, regained strength and were no longer depressed
the truands are blocking the streets
amid all the noise, at the far end of the tavern, on the seat inside the fireplace, a philosopher was meditating, his feet in the ashes and his eyes on the burning brands
mahiette seemed to awaken from her thoughts
at that moment the fresh, joyous sound of children’s voices passed by the cell
crossing the macar some mules were lost
dearest brother, i’d like to settle down to a better life
no thief has ever stolen
at the bedside a dagger lay on a cypress wood table; the sight of this shining blade excited her with an urge for blood
at last, when he was sure, quite sure, that she was no longer there, that it was finished, that someone had stolen her from him, he went back slowly up the tower staircase, that staircase he had scaled in such excitement and triumph the day he had rescued her
gringoire started looking for fresh solutions
one had its ears horribly split, another a large wound on the knee, the third had had its trunk cut off
at court he was politely called olivier le daim; among the people, olivier the devil
some distance behind them two men dressed in the flemish cut conversed in low tones, and they were not so hidden in the shadows that anyone who had been present at the performance of gringoire’s mystery play could have failed to recognize in them two of the principal flemish envoys, guillaume rym, the shrewd pensionary from ghent, and jacques coppenole, the popular hosier
the pikes were not strong enough and broke, the elephants swept through the phalanxes like boars through tufts of grass; they uprooted the stakes of the camp with their trunks, went through it from end to end, knocking over the tents with their chests: all the barbarians had fled
i don’t understand,  said gervaise
imagine what an effect that would have!
by the way, jehan, don’t you have any money left?
and whatever he tries, do not call out!
carthage, megara, her house, her room, and the countryside she had come through swirled in her memory in a series of tumultuous but clear images
they fly in one direction and look towards another—the priest thus passed by above quasimodo without seeing him
there are invariably two naves crossing at right angles, the upper end of which is rounded into an apse and forms the choir; there are always side aisles for processions inside the church, for chapels, a kind of lateral ambulatory into which the main nave empties through the bays
i reckon that it’s rare, right enough, that anyone should stay as fiercely pure as a nun in the midst of those gypsy girls who are so easily tamed
what are the names of your two friends?
they followed him, others came up, and like him they all went in the direction of the mappalia
if you have some mumbo-jumbo to get through first, over there in that mortar there is a very fine stone god the father which we stole from saint-pierre-aux-bœeufs
seen thus, in the half-light cast over the square by the truands’ few torches, the long beam carried by this mass of men running to hurl it against the church made one think of some monstrous beast with hundreds of feet charging head down against the giant of stone
one half formed the earth, the other the firmament
the art has become just skin and bones
i swear by my share of paradise that i won’t come near you without your leave and permission; but give me some supper
in silence he freed his feet from the folds of his robe, picked up his lantern and began slowly climbing the steps up to the door; he opened the door once more and went out
the last to arrive, standing against the trees, looked at the low tables, half hidden under crimson coverings, and waited their turn
they broke the sycamore chest; it was three quarters empty
and then there’s the character of the inhabitants
but he may very well be right, this madman, doctor jacques!
monsieur the king’s attorney in ecclesiastical courts,  said the president, the court is ready to hear your requisitions
they are having a warm; fine way to enjoy yourself!
thus, having no other way of declaring itself but in stone masonry, thought rushed to it from every direction
it’s quite true then, i shall never see her again, not even in heaven!
to love her with all the frenzy in one’s soul, to feel that for the least of her smiles one would give one’s blood, one’s entrails, reputation, salvation, immortality and eternity, this life and the next; to regret not being a king, emperor, archangel, god, so that she could have a greater slave at her feet; to embrace her night and day in dreams and thoughts; and see her in love with a soldier’s uniform!
captain phoebus, you’re a lucky soldier!
jehan restrained him: shame on you, captain phoebus de châteaupers!
the gypsy gave him a few little taps on the mouth with her pretty hand, playfully childish, graceful, and gay
moreover, it was not only his body which seemed to have been fashioned to fit the cathedral, but his mind too
a rotten little montaigu cappette, wasn’t it?
then grief, heavier than the humiliation of defeat, overwhelmed the barbarians

as for the celtic stratum, no more examples of it were being found then, even when wells were dug
a good fellow for a bishop!

gold is the sun, to make gold is to be god
what will it be?
a thousand livres parisis for a mass!
chantefleurie had pounced on the little shoe, all that remained to her of everything she had loved
she slept as lightly and restlessly as a bird; the least thing woke her up
behind the acropolis, where the land was red earth, the mappalian way, with tombs on either side, ran straight from the shore to the catacombs; then came large dwellings spaced out amid gardens, and this third quarter, megara, the new town, went up to the edge of the cliff, where stood a giant lighthouse which blazed out every night
we needed it,  said the syssitia chiefs
sister,  said the archdeacon, do you really hate gypsy women then?
the captain was the first to break the silence: upon my word,  he said in his fearlessly fatuous voice, what a charming creature she is!
for so long she had grown unaccustomed to sleep
attached to this little shoe was a scrap of parchment on which was written this verse:
how can she be saved?
it had been ended despite all his efforts, so that, despairing of carthage, he had handed over control of the mercenaries to gisco
at last he dared to touch him with a finger, lightly, on the elbow
then, beyond the regions directly subject to carthage, extended the allies who paid only a modest tribute; behind the allies roamed the nomads, who could always be let loose on them
some waited for the grapples from the doors to touch the wall before launching out; in the middle of the upper platform the skeins of the balistae were wound up, and the great shaft of the catapult was lowered
the suffete had concentrated his men in a circular mass, in such a way as to offer equal resistance all round
he had come to terms with the din, and was determined to go on to the end, not abandoning the hope of regaining the people’s attention
he tires out pierrat torterue himself, and his hands are bigger than mine
four mansions almost touching, the hôtels de jouy, de sens, de barbeau, and the logis de la reine were mirrored in the seine, their slate roofs punctuated by slender turrets
her hair had been curled to resemble a cloud
it’s the sower, isn’t it?—eh, master, what’s on your mind?
the barbarians’ eyes fixed on it as they shivered all over, and tears came to their eyes
it was something unintelligible and awful:
to measure a toe is to measure the giant
i have tried everything!
he was an austere, solemn, morose priest; having the cure of souls; monsieur the archdeacon of josas, second acolyte to the bishop, having charge of the two deaneries of montlhéry and châteaufort and a hundred and seventy-four rural incumbents
it was not that his single eye was any less able to see at long range, but there was a mass of soldiers preventing him from making out everything
then the women laughed and cried, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for at that moment quasimodo truly had a beauty of his own
he took sole charge of war, government, and finances; and to forestall any accusations he asked for hanno to inspect his accounts
at last the prisoner broke the silence: who are you?
the slave interrupted him:
that gloomy, unhappy face beamed radiantly
hitherto all he had known was humiliation, contempt for his condition, disgust for his person
here we have a keep, a tower with an alarm bell, cannon, citizens, soldiers
perhaps she is deaf,  oudarde said with a sigh
i am your friend
the unhappy girl would in any case be woken soon enough to die
but hamilcar took the path by the mill, from which emanated a mournful dirge
every morning he left the truands’ quarters, usually with the gypsy girl, he helped her collect the harvest of targes and petits-blancs at the street crossings; every evening he went home with her under the same roof, let her bolt herself in her little room, and slept the sleep of the just
give me back my child!
he snatched the papers from the other man’s hands
nothing could be seen of his body, neither his face nor his hands
he came up the stairs: then he stopped at the edge of the terrace and crossed his arms
first he refused men of sedentary occupation, then those whose bellies were too fat or who looked cowardly, and he admitted men in disgrace, the scum of malqua, sons of barbarians, freedmen
he made off in that direction
jehan, master of the battlefield, pressed on in triumph: i’d do it too, even if i am an archdeacon’s brother!
she had flung the poor gypsy, half dead, into the corner of the cellar, and had resumed her position at the window, both hands resting on the corner of the ledge like a pair of talons
the tourangeau, despite the intelligence in his eyes, had seemed for some time now no longer able to understand dom claude
a few moments after passing the bell cage, he came upon a little landing, inserted into a recess in the side wall, and under the vault a low, pointed door
the ground sloped upwards, they were assailed by javelins, and turned back – and with mighty blows of their tusks and hooves they ripped, smothered, flattened the carthaginians
he gave an order in an undertone to two archers who took the truand away
in the ancestral chamber there is a golden ingot under each stone; an underground passage leads to their graves
what did i tell you sister, that young cleric, monsieur claude frollo, is a sorcerer
at last they stopped
the mellifluous instruments of the hymns sound out, the angels’ sweetest melodies, the wondrous song of songs!]
went on the soldier, flattered by the provost’s praise, the breaks in the iron are quite fresh!
however, some sort of noise must have issued from it, even if it were no more than the tramp of feet
the poet went on
and on the left, that big black cat?
it caused a diversion
a crude job for a philosopher
by the cave of hadrumetum and the kingdom of the spirits!
we’ll go on together to spell out the façades of saint-côme, sainte-geneviève-des-ardents, saint-martin and saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie …’
they were sent oxen, sheep, guineafowl, dried fruit, and lupins, with smoked mackerel, that excellent mackerel exported by carthage to every seaport
well spoken,  cried the people; let’s start the hanging with his sergeants
his name was spendius
i just love the apricot tree carved over the door with its amusing play on words: á l’abri-cotier
their incomplete or multiple limbs were swollen by their terrible exertions
: bailiffs, échevins, burgomasters; burgomasters, échevins, bailiffs; all stiff, formal, starchy in their best velvet and damask, wearing cramignole caps of black velvet with huge tassels of cyprus gold thread; good flemish heads after all, dignified, severe features belonging to the same family as that which rembrandt brings out so powerfully and gravely against the black background of the night watch’; personages every one of whom bore graven on his brow that maximilian of austria had been right, as his manifesto ran: to have full confidence in their prudence, valour, experience, loyalty, and integrity’
she went a little red, and lowered her eyes; her long, sweeping lashes made shadows on her cheeks
they went forward to these uncertain rays
she shook her head again, stared at oudarde and answered: water
then she saw her captain frown, and a beautiful girl, who was leaning back on him, look at him with scornful lip and angry eye, then phoebus spoke some words, which did not reach her, and the two of them hurriedly disappeared behind the balcony window, which closed behind them
he had both arms round her
this breath contracted, creating desire and the sky, and from desire and the sky emerged primal matter
in speaking of this man had not schahabarim said that she must conquer moloch?
the captain stood leaning on the back of her chair, and in a low voice she grumbled at him affectionately:
dom claude paled again, and the student casually went on: and that word underneath, incised with the same hand, ’aναγνεία means impurity
pierre, my friend,  said the king of tunis, what the devil are you thinking about?
which has translated it?
meanwhile the dancer stayed motionless in the doorway
behind these palaces, there ran in every direction, now fenced, stockaded, crenellated like a citadel, now veiled with tall trees like a charterhouse, the vast, multi-form enclosure of the marvellous hôtel de saint-pol, where the king of france could provide superb accommodation for twenty-two princes of the rank of the dauphin or the duke of burgundy, with their servants and suites, not to mention great nobles, and the emperor when he came to look at paris, and the lions, who had their separate residence within the royal residence
messieurs the flemings, come and see this
your eminence,  the abbot replied, is wasting his courtesies on these flemish snouts
the king only loosens his hold when the people snatch
that’s half as much again as in the time of the paclet brothers, but it is not a lot
the insults were atrocious, obscene, with ironic encouragement and imprecations; and as his present pain was not enough for them, they promised him still more fearful pains for eternity
what am i saying?
as behind owls do songbirds in full cry
others who had daubed themselves ceremoniously with vermilion looked like coral statues
it’s a dream that you’re telling me
in this enclosed space, in this sombre setting of hangings and panelling, she was incomparably more beautiful and radiant than in a public square
the word hermetics’ suddenly brought to his mind the image of archdeacon claude frollo
do you not see her wandering round him like a woman in love running after a man in a field?
the cloister was abandoned, the canons had fled to the bishop’s palace to pray there together; the garth was empty, with a few terrified servants hiding in dark corners
the star was louis xi’s candle
all were placed facing the sun, towards moloch the devourer, stretched on the ground or supine, with the ones condemned to be flogged, standing against the trees, with two men by them, one counting the strokes, the other striking
may the great devil neptune stick his fork in me if i don’t make you the happiest creature in the world
when it had come up close to him, it stopped, and stayed as motionless as the statue of cardinal bertrand
with the death of michelangelo what did this wretched architecture do, living on as a spectre and shade of its former self?
spendius, with , men, went to the bridge built over the macar, three miles from utica; its corners were fortified with four huge towers provided with catapults
twelve men from greek colonies embarked at annaba on a numidian sloop
hamilcar accepted their challenge
you will rest later, won’t you?
a few moments later our poet found himself in a little gothic vaulted room, nicely private and warm, sitting in front of a table which looked as if it would be only too pleased to borrow one or two things from a meatsafe hanging nearby, with the prospect of a decent bed, and alone in the company of a pretty girl
here’s some-thing else,  added maître jacques, rummaging again in his satchel, we found in marc cenaine’s house
as soon as they caught sight of someone they invited him to their entertainments
he could hear his cassock, which had caught on the rainspout, tearing and coming unstitched every time he gave a jerk
go to the devil!
ceraunites engendered by thunder twinkled near chalcedonies, which are a cure for poisons
oudarde in her turn, more gently and tenderly, said: sister!
above the towers, far up in the sky, faint bird-cries could be heard
so quasimodo was in charge of the peal at notre-dame
upon my soul, the rector of the university should have done the same
proud of having forced the republic to yield, the mercenaries thought that they were at last going to return home with their blood-money in the hood of their cloaks
they ought at least to give us a morris dance or some other mummery!
i don’t know, monsieur,  the young man replied
she seemed to fill it with her spirit
those who, like ourselves, never pass by the place de grève without sparing a look of pity and sympathy for that poor turret, squeezed between two ramshackle louis xiv buildings, can easily reconstruct in their mind’s eye the whole collection of buildings to which it belonged and thus recreate in its entirety the old gothic place of the fifteenth century
you stand accused before us: primo, of causing nocturnal disturbance; secundo, of indecent assault against the person of a loose woman, in praejudicium meretricis [to the detriment of a harlot]; tertio, of rebellious and disloyal conduct towards the archers of the ordinance of the king, our master
here a bell rang out, there a hammer, over there the complex clatter of a moving cart
maître olivier, seeing the king in generous mood and thinking the moment favourable, came up in his turn: sire …’
what is to be done?… how can i get back into carthage?
bronze plates, silver ingots, and iron bars alternated with pigs of tin brought from the cassiterides by way of the dark sea; gums from the lands of the negroes spilled out of their palm-bark sacks; and gold-dust, heaped up in wineskins, leaked imperceptibly through seams worn with age
he was leaning against the corner of his fiancée’s house, swearing like a heathen
the man in black opened it with a key he had
i can assure you that she’ll have lots of men in love with her, that one!
the idea of some attempt against the gypsy girl returned to his mind
how happy you would be in great cool rooms, lying on flowers, with lyres playing, clowns, and women!
he had solicited an edict from the bishop expressly forbidding gypsy women to dance and play their tambourines in the square before the cathedral, and at the same time had been going through the official’s musty archives to collect cases of sorcerers and sorceresses condemned to the flames or the rope for complicity in witchcraft with he-goats, sows, or she-goats
all attempts to find her had been in vain
no king, no god!
he had only one thought left now, and that was to kneel down in front of her whom he had just saved for the second time
just then one of the braids of the salamander’s’ hair came undone, and a small brass coin that was attached to it rolled on to the ground
then i glimpsed the demon’s snare, and i doubted no more that you had come from hell and had come thence for my damnation
what are you talking about, neighbour?
he gave my place in the norman nation to little ascanio falzaspada, who belongs to the province of bourges, since he’s italian
you tell the enemy which route they are to follow, as you did with those gauls in sicily, or you put them ashore in the middle of the sea
at times he looked up into the air, as people do when they are bored
it was the first time
it was the clibanarii’s armour, the punic camp; then they distinguished other, more numerous, lights round about, because the mercenary armies, now merged, extended over a wide area
human speech for him always meant mockery or curses
they accused and threatened their leaders
the waves of this human flood, constantly spreading, broke against the corners of houses projecting here and there like headlands into the irregular basin formed by the place
you don’t know what unhappiness is
and above all the other voices that of joannes de molendino could be heard, cutting through the hubbub like the fife in a charivari at nîmes: start right away!
and the chased ironwork which made biscornette lose heart?
he cried, furiously seizing gringoire by the arm; could you have been so forsaken by god as to lay hands on that girl?
in so doing you will be performing a most noble act for our lady, and i swear to you that i am very frightened at the idea of being hanged
as you see, master
where are you going?
but, although it was the season for sowing and ploughing, the fields were, as far as the eye could see, empty as the desert
at most she would sometimes catch a glimpse of the bell-ringer’s face at the top of a tower, mournfully gazing at her
his distorted voice sounded like a roar; he said:
his hand, however, moved quite freely; he held his nose and resigned himself
every time autharitus considered gisco he was seized with fury at the memory of his insult: he would have killed him but for the vow he had made to narr’havas
that was not much of a supper
everything was ready, and still hamilcar did not move
she smelled of honey, pepper, incense, roses, and something else as well
he stopped, then, in front of the statue as usual
the garden, long neglected, had grown profusely; colocynths climbed up into the branches of cassias, asclepiads dotted the rose beds, all kinds of vegetation had entwined and formed arbours; and the sun’s rays, slanting down, brought out here and there, as in a wood, the shadow of a leaf on the ground
it’s as densely packed as a cabbage heart!
they remembered that several of them who had left for carthage had never returned; no doubt they had been killed
soon this resource ran out
girl, night and day, yes, night and day, does that deserve no pity?
while you were away i had pits dug in the arsenals, the gardens, everywhere!
quasimodo regarded it all with an air of indifference and surprise
you admit to seeing the ram that beelzebub makes appear in the clouds to convene the sabbath, and is seen only by sorcerers?
and, carried by all these shoulders gripping his sides, he repeated: what are you going to do?
he had gone about it with such enthusiasm that the inscription eduensis episcopus [bishop of autun] had been almost obliterated
boy, let me be first to go up
when thinking about phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought of quasimodo
the orgy was becoming more and more flemish
meanwhile the archdeacon, who had left charmolue in utter amazement, had come close to them, stopping a short way off, and was observing the two of them without their being aware of him, so deeply absorbed were they in contemplation of the wallet
a sign from claude, and the idea of pleasing him, would have been enough to make quasimodo throw himself off the top of the towers of notre-dame
we have all been beaten!
the others were whispering
he went to open the door
a single word of forgiveness!
it was no easy matter that day to gain admission to the great hall, though at the time it was reputed to be the largest enclosed and covered space in the world

half dead she turned to the window, and saw the sachette’s wild face through the bars
he began striding up towards the place de grève, holding her by the hand
she thought about the possibility of a popular insurrection to snatch her from her refuge
i shall fall to the pavement if you don’t take pity on me, pity on yourself
but disenchanted though gringoire was, the overall scene was not without glamour and magic: the bonfire cast a harsh red glare which flickered brightly over the circle of faces in the crowd, over the girl’s brown forehead, and on the square behind cast a pale reflection mingled with their wavering shadows, on one side upon the black, wrinkled old façade of the maison-aux-piliers, on the other on the stone arms of the gibbet
how irreverent you are!
his breast was indeed lacerated as though by a tiger’s claw, and in his side was a large wound which had not properly closed
her father had not wanted her to enter the college of priestesses, nor even that she should learn anything about the tanit of the people
i cried out so much that the good lord heard me
mademoiselle will testify to the fact that we acted with all possible gentleness
why were his remaining hairs already grey?
none of your formulas gives any real results, whereas alchemy has made discoveries
she is not like any other daughter of men!
or was it that marie had a rival in the heart of the bell-ringer of notre-dame, and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were being neglected for something more beautiful and worthy of love?
there was a clutter of tongs, pincers, great ploughshares inside the furnace, all reddening together on the coals
if only i could just once, once more, once only, put this shoe on her pretty little pink foot, i would die, good virgin, blessing you!—ah!
a man in black with a handsome officer
they waved their scarves from a distance; then they came in the dark to talk to the soldiers through the gap in the wall, and the grand council learned one morning that they had all run off
it was an oryngian stallion, fed on balls of flour, which bent its knees for its master to mount
the priest was rolling on the ground in the water and banging his skull on the corners of the stone steps
from the peal in the slender spire over the crossing to the great bell over the doorway, he was fond of them all
yes,  the priest answered
the syssitia, claiming their right to wreckage, demanded the younger ones to sell; and the new-carthaginians married lacedaemonians, who were blonde
they amused themselves looking at the pillory, a very simple sort of monument consisting of a cube of masonry some ten feet high, hollow inside
the actors went bravely on
a thought had occurred to him as he was lacing up his boots, but at first he rejected it; however, it came again, and he put his waistcoat on back to front, an obvious sign of violent inner struggle
in the distance a few lanterns glided over the harbour, and there were lights in the temple of khamon
for a long time they looked at each other in silence, and salammbo’s eyes, buried in her long draperies, looked out like twin stars through a break in a cloud
thus the old suffete larded his address with proverbs and apologias, nodding his head the while to invite some approval
the seine was lost to sight under the bridges, the bridges under their houses
the reader may not have forgotten that a moment before catching sight of the truands’ nocturnal band, quasimodo, inspecting paris from the top of his bell tower, had seen only one light still shining, twinkling like a star in a window of the top storey of a tall, gloomy building, near the porte saint-antoine
salammbo, calm as a statue, did not seem to understand
some terrible astrological predictions had originated in that laboratory
on that day, just as he arrived outside the low door of the cubby-hole and was inserting in the lock the intricate little key which he always carried with him in the wallet hanging by his side, the sound of tambourine and castanets reached his ear
at that there filed in, two by two, with a gravity strongly contrasting with the exuberant ecclesiastical suite of charles de bourbon, maximilian of austria’s ambassadors, led by the reverend father in god jehan, abbot of saint-bertin, chancellor of the golden fleece, and jacques de goy, sieur dauby, high bailiff of ghent
however, such was his respect for the priest, his gratitude, devotion, love for the man were so deeply rooted in his heart that they held out even at that moment against the claws of jealousy and despair
but the carthaginians, placed in the middle of the syntagmata, and who had suffered less, were stamping with impatience at the vengeance that was eluding them; they were already going off in pursuit of the mercenaries; hamilcar appeared
one had to be content with these four rubble walls and two sandstone backplates, and a mean stone gibbet, meagre and bare, beside it
if the lions sleeping in the courtyard had come in roaring the clamour would not have been more appalling
it was priestly dread in the face of a new agent: printing
allow me to rejoin my company, because it’s without its captain
the sachette once more hugged her daughter
the germanies are so great and powerful that it is scarcely credible!
phoebus, the sunshine, noonday, fresh air, dancing to applause, sweet prattling of love with the officer, all that indeed still ran through her mind, sometimes as a golden, lilting vision, sometimes as a shapeless nightmare; but now it was just a vague, horrible struggle fading into the darkness, or distant music playing up there above ground, no longer audible at the depths to which the unfortunate girl had fallen
the reply bore so little relevance to the question that the uncontrollable laughter began again, and messire robert cried out, red with fury: are you scoffing at me too, you arrant rogue?
whereas if they continued their efforts they would obtain at once liberty, vengeance and money!
gringoire replied in such passionate tones that he himself was astonished to hear himself speak like that
the streamers fastened to the horns of his helmet flapped in the wind behind him, and he had put his oval shield under his left thigh
the priest stayed undecided
you are taking orpheus for hermes
the man in black stood up
her eyes remained cast down
he wanted the veil, not that he had any confidence in its virtues (spendius only believed in the oracle), but he was convinced that when the carthaginians found they had been deprived of it they would fall into deep despondency
as he spoke, the old man had raised his head
you have come to consult me, maître, concerning which science?
no one would have dared to do anything against me!
the priest saw him, and with his fingertip tested the point of a dagger which he kept hidden on his breast
next day they slaughtered all the mules, about forty of them
fine so far,  observed the philosopher
meanwhile he forgot about drinking
so he was there, her friend, protector, support, refuge, her phoebus!
and the head farrier number livres!
his savings are like the spleen, which swells up as all the other parts grow lean
so she was la chantefleurie
they were all their own masters
they went to the right and left, hampered by the tent ropes, the wandering animals and the tripods where food was cooking
so saying the priest took her by the arm
suddenly he felt a hand laid gravely on his shoulder
a groom of the bedchamber at number livres a year!
it all comes back to me
suddenly zarxas, now handsome and vigorous, leaped like an acrobat on his friends’ shoulders and cried:
as for the elephants, they were not sufficiently trained
—her voice, her face, her movements, her whole person bore the heart-rending expression of a shipwrecked mariner making distress signals to the ship merrily passing in the distance in a ray of sunshine on the horizon
there is his honour gilles lecornu, brother of maître jacques lecornu, provost of the king’s household, son of maître mahiet lecornu, head porter of the bois de vincennes, all burghers of paris, all married from father to son!
they sat down on the tombs, out of breath, then began again
at that time nothing could be simpler than putting an animal on trial for sorcery
go away, if you are afraid!
he thus became more and more learned and at the same time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a priest, more and more gloomy as a man
but all this touching, the smell of the perfumes and the fasting exhausted her
he answered with a look colder and heavier than an executioner’s axe; the slave, fainting, fell to the dust at his feet
hanno proposed some atrocious and impracticable measures, such as promising a large sum for each barbarian head, or burning their camp with boats and machines
now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the chancellorship, and the mastership fallen since robert d’estouteville had held the provostship of paris!
then, in a solemn voice: master, in tanit’s sanctuary there is a mysterious veil, fallen from the heavens, which covers the goddess
you can’t go out
you love me, don’t you?
the glass globes on the temple roofs sparkled here and there like large diamonds
yes, kill him, you must!
only yesterday, for a bath attendant and four kitchen hands, i paid more than i used to for a pair of elephants!
spendius, surrounded by greeks, hid in one of the crevasses; as he was afraid, he spread the rumour of his death
this episode had seriously distracted the audience, and a good number of spectators, with robin poussepain and all the clerks in the lead, merrily applauded the weird duet improvised in the middle of the prologue by the student with his strident voice and the beggar with his imperturbable chant
suddenly great plumes were raised, and to the rhythm of flutes a fearful song broke out
at the end of that gallery is a door, which is only ever closed on the latch; with this ladder i climb up there, and i’m inside the church
it’s a friend of mine
a man was dragging over the pavement something white to which something black was attached
god knows where and when maître florian would have made landfall, thus launched in full sail on the high seas of eloquence, if the low door at the back had not suddenly opened to admit monsieur the provost in person
it seemed to them as though they had just gone into a church for tenebrae in holy week
the formidable quasimodo had plunged down from his litter, and women averted their gaze so that they would not see him tear the archdeacon to pieces
he had learned to read in latin
then they spent the night eating, and the remains of the meat was burned with the skin, bones, horns, and nails
on the pavement at intervals crouched enormous lions, like sphinxes, living symbols of the devouring sun
they were all laughing in his face
that’s going a bit far
for the burghers of paris know that it is not enough in every contingency to pray or to plead for the freedoms of the city, and always have in reserve in a loft of the hôtel de ville some good old rusty arquebus
no doubt about it,  put in a third, she’s a witch who has dealings with the bogey-monk so as to rob officers
the dossier of the case was for him like a dog to a blind man
all that only increased the catcalls and jeers
at last hamilcar set up crosses for any who might talk of surrender; even the women were organized into bands
seen from a bird’s-eye view, then, these three townships of city, university, and town each appeared as an inextricable web of weirdly tangled streets
the captain exclaimed, with a roar of laughter
then they discovered on a camel a great bronze tub: it was the suffete’s, for bathing in during the journey; for he had taken all sorts of precautions, even taking along in cages weasels from hecatompylus which were burned alive to make his drink
from time to time he would stop in front of the clouded casement with its lead lattice, look, listen, and stamp his feet
he had himself transported to the arsenal, to the lighthouse, to the treasury in the temples: his great litter could be constantly seen, swaying from step to step, as it went up the stairs of the acropolis
a city was a collection of hundreds of lordships which divided it into compartments of every shape and size
you have, acting in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in the charge, on the night of number march last, murdered and stabbed, in league with the powers of darkness, with the help of charms and practices, a captain of the archers of the king’s ordinance, phoebus de châteaupers
they put a lance in salammbo’s hands which she offered to narr’havas; their thumbs were tied together with a thong of oxhide, then corn was poured over their heads, and the grains falling round them sounded like hail as they rebounded
when he saw his adversary on guard and ready to lunge: captain phoebus,  he said in a tone vibrant with bitterness, you are forgetting your appointment
great bunches of feathers swayed at their corners, and rays of light came from their sharp peaks ending in balls of crystal, gold, silver or copper
you got those great big eyes from me, mademoiselle
its lowest branches disappeared beneath strips of cloth and necklaces that the faithful had hung there
hanno recognized the king of the numidians in the rearguard; narr’havas bowed in greeting, and made a sign that he did not understand
meanwhile calm had been gradually restored
the barbarians were worried; this proposal of immediate booty made them dream; they were apprehensive of some treachery, not suspecting a trap in the suffete’s boastfulness, and they began to look at each other distrustfully
it suddenly caught sight of the gypsy girl, and jumping over the table and the clerk’s head, in two leaps was at her knee
here’s a way of getting off for the moment
gringoire wondered rather uneasily
others had sailed on westward for four months without landfall; but the ships’ prows became entangled with weeds, on the horizon there was the continuous thunder of waterfalls, blood-coloured mists hid the sun, a breeze laden with scents sent the crews to sleep; and at the moment they could not say anything, their memory had been so impaired
and the row of dots which followed his mental reticence implied some rather pleasing vague ideas
so you know jupiter?
a very steep set of rough stone steps, known as the ladder’ par excellence, led to the upper platform, on which could be seen a horizontal wheel of solid oak
they came back, chasing amid the cries and dust a score or so of men distinguishable by their paler faces
from top to bottom the walls shook with it, and the two sides of the street seemed to mâtho to be coming at him and lifting him off the ground, like two huge arms choking him in the air
i’m going somewhere where i can see you without you seeing me
he closed his one eye, let his head drop on to his chest and looked as if he were dead
every mind is a mason
behind them thronged a ragged mob
he suddenly cried amid the expectant calm which had followed the commotion, jupiter, our lady the virgin, you devil’s tumblers!
make them all as deaf as i am
the truand looked at the king, swinging his arms with a dazed expression
come along, a little pity, gringoire—be generous in your turn
woe betide you if you approach that woman!
it is the fault of the rich!
with that done, he had been calmly watching, whistling from time to time when a blackbird passed by
and yet between us lie the invisible waters of a limitless ocean!
three men’s hearts differently made
at regular intervals stood towers, built by the carthaginians to watch over the tribes
domestic animals, reverting to wildness, ran off at the least sound
the three barbarians, hairy and covered in rags, looked at him without understanding what he was saying
thus, to sum up the points just mentioned, gothic architecture is today disfigured by three kinds of ravage
the ex-slave began to describe the manoeuvres
they told themselves; tomorrow came and went
at this oath, louis xi’s favourite one, someone seemed to be waking up inside the cage, chains scraped noisily across the floor, and a feeble voice was raised, which seemed to come from the grave: sire!
and the rector’s stools!
amen’ said the archdeacon
and when i’m old or ugly, phoebus, when i am no longer fit to love you, my lord, you’ll still put up with me as a servant
so he went up to the top floor of his house; then taking from a golden shell hanging from his arm a nail-studded spatula, he opened a small oval room
the barbarians turned in that direction, and as the crowd then drew away, there appeared in their midst, moving as slowly as a phantom, a human being, bent double, thin, completely naked and covered down to his flanks by long hair bristling with dry leaves, dust, and thorns
went on the bald man’s voice
olivier, write without delay to monsieur the maréchal de rouault—that discipline is growing slack—that the men-at-arms of the ordinances, the nobles of the ban, the free archers, the swiss are causing endless trouble to the inhabitants—that the soldiers, not satisfied with the property they find in the farmworkers’ houses, force them, by beating them with staves and spears, to go into town and look for wine, fish, spices and other extravagances—that monsieur the king knows this—that we intend to keep our people from harassment, theft, and pillage—that such is our will, by our lady!—that furthermore it is not our pleasure that any minstrel, barber, or servant-at-arms should dress like a prince in velvet, silk and gold rings—that such vanities are hateful to god—that we content ourselves, we who are gentlemen, with a doublet of cloth at number sols the paris ell—that messieurs the camp-followers can very well come down to that too—order and command—to monsieur de rouault, our friend—right
he never dreamed of any other espaliers than those of the stained-glass windows always in bloom, any shade but that of the stone foliage, laden with birds, flowering in clumps on the saxon capitals, any mountains but the colossal towers of the church, any ocean but paris murmuring at their feet
do you understand, you rascal?
he clapped his hand to his mouth to stifle his sobs, and half swooning in his intoxication he let go the halter of his dromedary, which went on with long, regular paces
abdalonim, still prostrate, told him about the barbarians’ feast he had been unable to avoid carrying out the elders’ order – besides, salammbo had wanted lavish expenditure to give the soldiers a better reception
as he plunged into the side aisles he saw, behind a cluster of pillars, a reddish gleam
at this point gringoire firmly believed that ever since that morning he had just been in a dream, and that this was a continuation of the same dream
quasimodo was there behind her
the very children were arming themselves, and even the legless cripples, in bard and cuirass, scuttled between the drinkers’ legs like huge beetles
by my share of paradise, monseigneur,  gringoire replied, trembling in every limb, i swear to you that i have never touched her, if that’s what is worrying you
there was an immense cry of imprecation, then everything went quiet, and a few unfortunate victims crawled mutilated from under the pile of dead
pour avoir mangé trop d’épice,
at that moment a crowd formed under the plane-trees
after all, on the tribune as on the marble table, it was all the same spectacle: the conflict of husbandry and clergy, of nobility and trade
the barbarian army, on the other hand, had not been able to keep its alignment
in any case, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl calling him
i don’t see anyone in the dock
there was a tavern in the lower room, and the rest on the floors above
the wind drove him on to the roof of a house where the unfortunate man’s body was first smashed
he looks at you: he’s one-eyed
there was another silence, then he continued: what have i done with him, lord?
what, in the words of jean de troyes, excited all the people of paris’ on number january was the twofold celebration, combined since time immemorial, of the feast of the epiphany and the feast of fools
it was the pulpit and the manuscript, the spoken and the written word, taking fright at the printed word; something like the stupefaction of a sparrow seeing the angel legion spreading his six million wings
people at the door tried to get in
fortunately an unexpected incident came to his rescue
his huge gnome’s head would lean out over the balustrade, then an enormous stone would fall, then another, then yet another
finally he made a third appearance, on top of the great bell’s tower; from there he seemed to be displaying proudly to the whole town the girl whom he had rescued and his thunderous voice, the voice that was so seldom heard by anyone, and which he himself could never hear, repeated three times, in a frenzy, up into the clouds: asylum!
the poor wretch’s melancholy became as incurable and complete as his deformity
but your knees are shaking and you are looking at me like a drunken man!
there the noise of tumult in the air was already fainter
your desire is a sacrilege; be content with the knowledge you possess!
try now to imagine what capital outlay would be needed to rewrite the book of architecture; to restore to the earth those teeming thousands of buildings; to return to the ages when the throng of monuments was such that in the words of an eye-witness: it was as though the world had shaken off its old garments to clothe itself in a white vestment of churches
at one such moment he suddenly saw opening mysteriously the french window to the balcony whose stone balustrade was silhouetted above his head
clopin trouillefou said to the three argoteers, all set to pounce on gringoire like three spiders on a fly
beside it lay an equally dusty pair of bellows, its upper leaf bearing the legend, incrusted in brass letters: spira, spera [breathe, hope]
the perfumes flowing from their brows wet their ragged tunics with large drops, and as they leaned with both hands on the tables, which seemed to them to be tossing about like ships at sea, they drunkenly gazed round so that they could devour with their eyes what they could not seize
he went on: one day, i was leaning at the window of my cell… what was i reading?
the mercenaries were begged not to lose heart; the brave men of tunis were about to come with large reinforcements
yes,  said the student
with my sword and lance, i plough and reap; i am the master of the house!
as he grew older he had found nothing but hatred around him
people were going, i went
armour, pitchforks, trumpets, bits of wood, iron and bronze, corn, straw, and clothes were scattered amongst the corpses; here and there some nearly extinguished fire-arrow burned against a heap of baggage; the ground, in certain places, disappeared beneath shields; the corpses of horses lay one after another like a chain of little mounds; one could see legs, sandals, arms, coats of mail and helmeted heads, kept in by their chinstraps and rolling about like balls; scalps hung on thorns; in pools of blood disembowelled elephants lay in their death throes, still carrying their towers; there were sticky things underfoot and muddy patches, though it had not rained
i could kiss, not your feet, you wouldn’t want that, but the ground beneath your feet; why!
he recognized his tent; and his eyes were riveted on the earth as if hamilcar’s daughter had sunk under the ground when she disappeared
you must die, my lovely, or be mine!
and the two students, jehan du moulin and robin poussepain, sang at the top of their voices the popular old refrain:
it was a cripple, short of both a leg and an arm, and so mutilated that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which held him up made him look like a builder’s scaffolding on the move
her rather flattened features were as yellow as her tunic
boundless joy swept over them, they embraced each other, wept
she had grown up practising abstinence, fasting, and purifications, always surrounded by solemn and lovely things, her body drenched in perfumes, her soul full of prayers
the suffete had been unable to know anything of this; the town, in front of him, concealed everything beyond, in the rear; and the captains dispatched successively to the two generals had not reappeared
quasimodo saw a lot of people go in but he saw no one come out
it was quite simple
what i’m telling you explains it all, doesn’t it?
in fact narr’havas only ruled over the massylians: and besides, having a custom permitting them to abandon their kings after a defeat, they had collected on the zainus, and then crossed it at hamilcar’s first move
and making a derisive bow in the direction of the church: thank you, canons!
the chief of sweet perfumes, as tall and pale as a wax taper, came towards hamilcar to crush a roll of metopion in his hands, while two others rubbed his heels with baccar leaves
i composed a most suitable epithalamium for mademoiselle of flanders and monseigneur the most august dauphin
poor fly who could not have budged the smallest of its stones!
and you torn to pieces in the streets!
from time to time it brought a pittance to the wretched penitent, looked into the hole to see whether the person inside was still alive, did not know his name, hardly knew how many years it had been since he had begun to die, and to a stranger enquiring about the living skeleton rotting in this cellar, the neighbours would simply answer: he’s the recluse’, or if it were a woman: she’s the recluse
he had the ten ambassadors crucified, side by side, on a hillock facing the town
the gypsy, without speaking a word, freed the goat
but they had to be protected against fire from the besieged garrison and first the ditch separating the walls had to be filled in
monsieur,  replied the archdeacon, if that is what is in your mind, you would have done better to have saved your breath by not climbing up my stairs
he observed such happiness, such beauty, with bitterness
the bridle rubbing round their armpits had formed purulent scabs such as one sees on a donkey’s withers, and the loose black rag that hardly covered their loins hung down at the end, beating against their calves like a long tail
a black cowled robe fell to his feet, a caffardum of the same colour hid his face
you kept me waiting fifteen years, merciful god, but that was so she would be beautiful when you gave her back
with these two quarters, one of mansions, the other of dwelling houses, the third feature of the town’s appearance was a long belt of abbeys which ran almost right round it, from east to west, forming behind the ring of fortifications enclosing paris a second inner ring of convents and chapels
clopin shook his head
this reflection decided him, and he plunged resolutely under the little black doorway and began climbing the saint-gilles spiral staircase leading to the upper floors of the tower
great, dark clouds, heavy, ragged, torn, hung like crêpe hammocks from the starry arch of night
i tell you that they were served by le sec, the town sergeant, at the hôtel du petit-bourbon, and that’s what misled you
and what we are saying here about the façade must be said of the entire church; and what we are saying about the cathedral church of paris must be said of all the churches of christendom in the middle ages
i adopt this child,  said the priest
but the space was too cramped for him to move his elbows
he looked up with a beseeching eye, and seeing that she was drawing him close to her, his whole face radiated joy and tenderness
pomegranates and colociynths loaded the capitals
i now feel a splendid vocation for that way of life
he tried to banish from his thoughts every form, every symbol and name of the gods, the better to grasp the unchanging spirit hidden behind appearances
we shall not attempt to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose, that horseshoe mouth, that tiny left eye obscured by a shaggy red eyebrow, while the right eye lay completely hidden beneath an enormous wart
we’ll be selling off our plate!
quasimodo jerked up as if suddenly roused from sleep
as long as they remain in this state of primal ignorance, moral and intellectual minors, it may be said of them as of the child: that age is without pity
i took you into carthage; i stole the zaïmph
after a silence he added: and what shall i do with the witch?
but the priest was neither listening nor looking at any of this
talk of the rector!
he looked for ways to serve her, to humble himself, and he even spread the zaïmph over her legs like an ordinary rug
for the rest, he was appreciated by the chief sapper’ of europe, he was familiarly involved in louis xi’s machinations, and often lent a hand with the king’s secret operations
the porphyry basin still contained a little clear water for salammbo’s ablutions
they filed past him, by nations, opening out their fingers to show the number of years; they were marked in turn on the left arm with green paint; the scribes delved into the gaping chest, and others, with a stylus, punched holes in a sheet of lead
four days later he was at gorza, on top of a pass, when spendius’ troops appeared below
saint-roch has a doorway that can be compared in magnificence only with saint-thomas d’aquin
but for all the beauty it has preserved in ageing, it is hard to repress a sigh, to repress indignation over the countless degradations and mutilations which time and men have simultaneously inflicted on the venerable monument, showing no respect for charlemagne, who laid its first stone, or for philip-augustus, who laid the last
meanwhile she wept torrents, in silence, in darkness, like rainfall at night
the stranger, meanwhile, was still pulling her along as silently and swiftly as ever
as possessor of this fief claude frollo was one of the seven score and one’ lords claiming feudal dues in paris and its suburbs, and his name could for a long time be seen inscribed in that capacity between the hôtel de tancarville, belonging to maître françois le rez, and the collège de tours, in the cartulary deposited at saint-martin-des-champs
without giving battle, the suffete maintained his advantage; the barbarians pursued him, while he seemed to be leading them on
behind the cloister there’s a little door giving on to the terrain, and from there on to the water
however the machines were not demolishing the rampart
mâtho looked at him with staring eyes
as for the students, they were swearing
in that connection colombe de gaillefontaine, another beautiful fair-skinned blonde in a high-necked blue damask dress, shyly ventured a remark which she addressed to fleur-de-lys in the hope that the handsome captain would reply to it: my dear gondelaurier, have you seen the tapestries in the hôtel de la roche-guyon?
once the gypsy heard him say to it: oh!
gringoire had apparently taken advantage of the moment of landing to slip away with the goat into the block of houses in the rue grenier-sur-l’eau
yesterday he told me: i want to be a soldier
the camp looked like a town, it was so full of people and movement
the suffete soaked his hand in this still warm slime, and rubbed his knees with it; it had remedial powers
provided the accused was hanged, that was all that was required
girl, you are of bohemian race, given to malefices
it was swimming towards the cité
the effect was like that of a torch brought from broad daylight into the shadows
gringoire fell on his backside, quite appalled with joy
to the wineshop,  said jehan
they could clearly make out his costume and his face resting on his hands
and maître pierre gringoire?
our marriage was a real foris maritagium [marriage to an outsider]
in those days people were not keen to attack someone who prayed night and day
they would have liked to exterminate them
you are too kind, master!
carthage recovered from her dejection; those who were not of canaanite origin were carried away by the passion of the others
the silence of these two men was frightening
from then on, feeling he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously
then, almost piercing him with his sharp look: no one suspects anything yet?…’
they say that he lights up the fires of hell in there and cooks the philosophers’ stone on a high flame
can these rogues go on with their farce?
everyone talked, no one listened, and spendius, usually so loquacious, merely nodded his head at every suggestion
the unfortunate girl felt so thoroughly abandoned by god and man that her head fell on her breast like some inert thing with no strength of its own
since the time when he began to live in the pit, they had almost forgotten him; troubled by old memories, they stood at a distance and did not dare lay hands on him
mâtho had lost his shoulder pieces, his helmet, his breastplate; he was completely naked, more livid than the dead men, his hair standing straight, with two flecks of foam at the corners of his lips, and his sword wheeled so rapidly that it looked like a halo round him
what’s this about a sword-thrust?
bulges and spaces had appeared along its excessive length; all the men were panting and breathless from running
he fell silent for a moment, then went on, as though talking to himself, in a loud voice: cain, what have you done with your brother?
hamilcar’s daughter worried endlessly about tanit
he expounded to her the theory of souls coming down to earth, following the same path as the sun along the signs of the zodiac
i couldn’t find him,  quasimodo said coldly
when she had gone by he started down the stairs again, moving as slowly as he had seen the spectre move, believing himself to be a spectre, haggard, hair standing on end, his hand still holding the extinguished lamp; and as he went down the spiral stairs, he distinctly heard in his ear a voice laughing and repeating: a spirit passed before my face; i heard a small breath; the hair of my flesh stood up
gringoire bit his lips
suddenly he raised his head, his sunken eyes seemed to be full of light, and his voice rang out like a bugle
captains stood all round him
he thanked providence for sending him such a good idea, but as he was about to cross the place du palais to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city, through which wind all those serpentine old sisters, the rues de la barillerie, de la vieille-draperie, de la savaterie, de la juiverie etc, still standing today with their nine-storey houses, he saw the pope of fools’ procession also leaving the palais and rushing across his path, with loud shouts, bright torchlight, and his, gringoire’s, band
it is fate that took you and delivered you up to the dreadful mechanism of the apparatus that i had secretly constructed!
they began to grow deeper, put storey upon storey, climbed one upon another, spurted upwards like any sap under pressure, and each strove to lift its head higher than its neighbours for the sake of a little fresh air
as for the intended function just mentioned, it fulfils it wonderfully; it is a bourse in france, as it would have been a temple in greece
someone had followed him, and through the darkness, for the lights of the feast were hidden by the corner of the palace, he recognized spendius
there then took place between them a strange dialogue of signs and gestures, for neither spoke
he was beautiful, he, the orphan, the foundling, the reject, he felt august and strong, he looked society in the face, that society from which he had been banished, and in which he was intervening so powerfully, that human justice whose prey he had snatched, all these tigers forced to chew on emptiness, those police agents, those judges, those executioners, all that royal might, which he had just broken, he the lowliest of the low, with the might of god
a physician for him, an executioner for everyone else
was it not louis xiv fulfilling the vow of louis xiii?
at first sight it could be seen to divide into several peculiarly distinct masses
put them in the van; mine will march to avenge themselves
it was infinitely surprising, bewildering
lying on his back, arms to his sides and knees together, he looked like a dead man prepared for burial
others said: your life!
but they will come back, mistress
the sex of the two male allegories was clearly indicated to every discerning spectator by their shorter robes and the cramignole’ caps they wore, while the two female allegories, whose dresses were not so short, wore hoods
but over there, at the far end, whatever can that be, that sort of trestle with four motley puppets on top and four more beneath?
my poor little hannibal!
he came on, head thrown back, eyes staring and open wide, chanting in a loud voice:
the swan flies both by night and day
what was that tale that archdeacon was making all that fuss about then?
i have arranged my life …’
he made the sign of the cross, stood up, put on his hat again and said to tristan: be quick about it, compère
she had never tasted wine, nor eaten meat, nor touched an unclean beast, nor set foot in the house of a dead person
such a death was as good as any other; and, then, moving his soldiers aside (for the punic standards hid the horizon from the mercenaries) he showed them the  elephants of narr’havas forming a single straight line and brandishing in their trunks great blades, like giants’ arms holding axes on their heads
it was as if he made the immense building breathe
it was a man’s face, austere, calm, sombre
in the middle squatted a woman warming herself at a brushwood fire, the smoke from which escaped through holes in the ceiling
so, despairing of the republic, hamilcar took by force from the tribes all he needed for the war; grain, oil, wood, animals and men
this group was mainly composed of persons of the fair sex
apparently he stayed in that posture for a long time, no longer thinking, shattered and passive under the demon’s hand
my word, captain phoebus,  said jehan, taking him by the hand, you swear with admirable vigour
cried the archdeacon just as the tumbler, sweating profusely, passed him with his pyramid of chair and cat, what is maître pierre gringoire doing there?
they ran to the forward posts, and the suffete’s baggage train arrived in the middle of the tents, pushed by the barbarians
their fortunes remained evenly matched; but both sides were so pent up that they longed for a great battle, instead of these skirmishes, so long as it really was the last
then what do you consider true and certain?
jehan, my friend, you’re drunk,  the other said
returning hopes of revenge carried him away
it fell on the roofs, into gardens, and the middle of courtyards, while people were sitting down to a meagre meal with heavy hearts
but who the devil,  the poet went on, had nothing better to do than apply for a decree of reintegration?
indeed, quasimodo, one-eyed, hunchbacked, bow-legged was hardly more than a more or less’
on these tables glistened pots dripping wine and beer, and round these pots were gathered numerous bacchic countenances, flushed from the fire and the wine
stop right there, you wretches, and let go of that wench!
the lights from the stones and the flame of the lamp were reflected in the great golden shields
the pyre that quasimodo had lit between the towers had gone out
her thoughts awoke too, and came back one by one
autharitus was not afraid of showing himself
claude had entrusted him to the same collège de torchi where he had spent his own early years in study and meditation; and it grieved him that this sanctuary, once edified by the name of frollo, should now be scandalized by it
and i can’t drink too much either
you may only show your face
here’s something to pay with
mâtho seized her heels, the golden chain snapped, and as the two ends flew off they struck the canvas like two vipers recoiling
it was a great popular movement, and every great popular movement, whatever its cause and its aim, always releases the spirit of freedom from its final precipitate
the sixth of january number is not, however, a day commemorated by history
all the people in this crowd were themselves struck by it, and began to clap their hands and shout: noël!
he it was who had gone to fetch monsieur de nemours from the bastille saint-antoine and bring him to the halles, and to bring monsieur de saint-pol to the grève, despite the objections and protests of the same, much to the delight of monsieur the provost, who was no friend of monsieur the constable
many mixed foreign practices into their native religion
his friends were taken aside
this is the grève
that’s a very odd idea of yours
fleur-de-lys loved him, he was her betrothed, she was alone with him, his former feelings for her had reawakened, not quite as freshly as before, but just as ardently; after all, it is no great crime to pluck an ear or two before the corn is ripe; i do not know if such thoughts ran through his mind, but what is certain is that fleur-de-lys was suddenly frightened by the expression in his eyes
she picked up two swords from the ground, balanced them by the tips on her forehead and made them turn in one direction while she turned in the other
châteaupers to the rescue!
they came up against the balustrade, threw themselves back and kept beginning afresh, attracting the crowd to them in the dizziness of this movement full of blood and screams
come here, then,  she cried
the sachette is in one of her crazy moods,  the people murmured; and that was as far as it went
he wears fustian breeches
the girl passed her arm through the window, the recluse threw herself upon that hand, fastened her lips to it and stayed, plunged in that kiss, showing no other sign of life than a sob which made her body heave from time to time
cheeks on fire, eyes inflamed, voice hoarse he strode rapidly through the camp; or sitting on the shore rubbed his great sword with sand
none of his enemies risked any complaint or recrimination
mahiette went on; as for a child, you are going to see one
[jonah number: number—all thy billows and thy waves passed over me]
she repeated her call three times, more loudly each time
those which first excited notice were the bernardins, with its three steeples; sainte-geneviève, whose square tower, still existing, makes one grieve for the loss of the rest; the sorbonne, half college, half monastery, of which such an admirable nave survives; the beautiful quadrilateral cloister of the mathurins; its neighbour, the cloister of saint-benoît, within whose walls they have had time to botch together a theatre between the seventh and eighth editions of this book; the cordeliers, with three enormous gables side by side; the augustins, whose graceful spire was, after the tour de nesle, the second sharp projection on that side of paris, counting from the west
what have they done with you?
never has more despair been lavished on a more graceful and dainty object
everything was clear, expeditious, explicit
you’ll be able to replace mistigri, as an extra knave of clubs in our lord the king’s pack of cards
then when the shaft of the catapult rose up, when the pillar of the balista quivered with the shock of the spring, when the stones flew through the air in a steady stream and darts poured down, he leaned right forward and threw his arms in the air, as if to follow them
but salammbo, as though someone had called her, turned her head; the people, who were watching her, followed the direction of her eyes
at last they agreed, and went back in
the sachet gave off a strong smell of camphor
finally he divided the men into two halves, told the first to wait for him; then, leading the others, galloping off at an imperious signal, he disappeared into the horizon, towards the mountains
the voice of the same woman who had interrupted the gypsy-girl’s dance now interrupted her song
it was at that moment that the recluse caught sight of the gypsy on the pillory through the window of her rat-hole and hurled at her the sinister imprecation: may you be accursed, daughter of egypt!
on this point he was so jealous of his austerity and reserve that when the dame de beaujeu, the king’s daughter, came in december number to visit the cloister of notre-dame, he solemnly opposed her admission, reminding the bishop of the statute in the black book, dated st bartholomew’s eve number, forbidding access to the cloister to any woman whatsoever, old or young, mistress or chambermaid’
everything caught the eye at once, the carved gable, the steep roof, the turret suspended at the corner of the walls, the stone pyramid of the eleventh century, the slate obelisk of the fifteenth, the bare, round tower of the castle keep, the square decorated tower of the church, the big, the small, the massive, the airy
quasimodo, far from loosing the horse’s bridle, was getting ready to make it turn round
the slaves were armed, the arsenals emptied; each citizen had his post and service
charmolue asked with his imperturbable benignity
bolder ones came up; their number increased; there was soon a crowd
, he would go up the spiral staircase in the bell tower faster than anyone else would have come down it
autharitus, who had only fifty gauls left, was going to kill himself to put an end to it all when, on top of the mountain, he thought he saw a man
bawled robin poussepain and the other clerks perched on the window
the first was a big, slab-faced girl
then he added these mysterious words: alas!
dom claude was jealous of quasimodo!
when will you have your great bell stuck on your head and put a hundred feet under the ground, cursed ringer?
in her temple or your house, what does it matter?
the best captains were out there with him!
it was hardly two days since the last cavalcade of that kind, the flemish embassy sent to conclude the marriage of the dauphin and marguerite of flanders, had entered paris, much to the annoyance of the cardinal de bourbon, who, to please the king, had had to put on a welcoming smile for this rustic bunch of flemish burgomasters and treat them, in his hôtel de bourbon, to a very fine morality, satire, and farce’, while torrential rain soaked the magnificent tapestries hung at his door
all around they saw an infinite number of beasts, lean, panting, brandishing their claws, and mixed one on top of the other in mysterious and frightening confusion
the stacked pikes and the weapons hanging up dazzled them like mirrors
it contained stables for  elephants with stores for their caparisons, their tethers and their food, then other stables for , horses with stores of barley and harness, and barracks for , soldiers with armour and all fighting equipment
but with so many interruptions it was hard to work out what he was there for
then leaning towards the window: paquette!
they had mastiffs, gazelles, or panthers following them
the scorn they felt for these traders made them still braver; and before spendius had ordered the movement, all had understood and were already executing it
it was clopin trouillefou
we’ll have to leave the cake on the window ledge, then
all her past misfortunes came back to her in a flash
men, women, animals, sex, health, sickness, everything seemed to be held in common by these people; everything went together, mingled, merged, superimposed; everyone shared in everything
and by the lamp was an old woman spinning and singing in a quavering voice
from the archdeacon he would endure anything, insults, threats, blows, with no murmur of reproach, without complaint
listen—i am nearly at an end
he repulsed her with a vehement gesture, full of pride
i’ll go and fetch the sergeants
as for gisquette and liénarde, they had long since deserted
a few liards had rolled into the mud; the captain, in his enthusiasm, stooped to pick them up
he did not know, he who wore his heart on his sleeve, who observed no other law in the world than the good law of nature, who let his passions flow according to his inclinations, and in whom the lake of violent emotions was always dry, from the many new ways he drained it every morning, he did not know how furiously the sea of human passions seethes and boils when it is denied any outlet, how it piles up, swells, overflows, how it scours the heart, bursts out in inward sobs and silent convulsions, until it has breached its dykes and burst its bed
countless other insults rained down on him, with boos, and imprecations, and roars of laughter, and now and then stones
there was applause for the kedeschim, among these women, with their painted eyelids, symbolizing the hermaphrodite nature of their deity, and, perfumed and robed like the women, these eunuchs resembled them despite their flat chests and narrower hips
as for the the vessels of the sacred legion, they were private property
to be sure, there is material for massive tomes, and often for the universal history of mankind, in these successive weldings of several arts at several levels on the same monument
then, when they were standing up again, hamilcar gave a sign ordering the man with the baldrick to speak
we have just tried to repair for the reader the admirable church of notre-dame de paris
there was a jovial-looking man with a big belly loudly kissing a fleshy, thick-set harlot
just see whether these idlers will move aside!
all of which was quite unknown to this crowd, which marvelled at the courtesies paid by the cardinal to this weedy-looking flemish bailiff
that also proves that one can be a real genius and still lack all understanding of an art which is not one’s own
and what more, i ask you!—it’s madness!
by the eight fires of the cabiri!
i should have carried her off!
a splendid decadence, though, for the old gothic genius; the sun setting behind the gigantic printing press at mainz still for a while sheds its final rays on that hybrid heap of latin arcades and corinthian colonnades
suddenly he struggled again in his chains in renewed desperation, which shook the whole framework supporting him, and breaking the silence which he had obstinately kept so far, he cried in a hoarse, furious voice, more like a bark than a human cry, and rising above the noise of jeers: a drink!
traditions had given birth to symbols beneath which they disappeared like a tree trunk beneath its foliage; all these symbols, in which mankind put its faith, grew, multiplied, intersected, becoming more and more complex, so that the early monuments were no longer adequate to contain them and overflowed everywhere; these monuments scarcely still expressed the primitive tradition, which like them was simple, unadorned and rested on the ground
nothing could break the spell put on the audience
gringoire swiftly stooped to pick it up
the splendour of her beauty casts a cloud of light around her; and i sometimes think that i have never seen her… that she does not exist… and that this is all a dream!
several of them approached, holding palms
first, starting from the tournelle, came the bourg saint-victor, with its single-arched bridge over the bièvre, its abbey, where one could read the epitaph of louis the fat, epitaphium ludovici grossi, and its church with an octagonal steeple, flanked by four eleventh-century turrets (there is one like it to be seen at étampes; it has not been pulled down yet); then the bourg saint-marceau, which already then had three churches and a convent
what does the amulet matter to me?
a moment later the door-hanging was raised and the gypsy girl appeared in the doorway, red-faced, dismayed, out of breath, not daring to take another step
he stopped short: i beg your pardon, ladies!
i believed that it would always depend on me whether to continue or interrupt this case
and as he went down the winding stairs of the palais he grumbled between his teeth: these parisians are a fine lot of asses and boors; they come to see a mystery play, and don’t listen to a word!
the door was made of rotten puncheon staves, which left wide cracks through which his predatory gaze could pass
from now on the field was clear for unbridled folly
he loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them
those who had swords held them bare in their hands; the most defiant stood leaning against the mountain
at length the tavern door opened
jehan clapped his hands: the devil!
you will not come again when i summon you, sitting by the lake side, throwing melon seeds into your mouths!
with no check, no sharing, all the money you want, all the prisoners, all the booty, fifty zerets of land for every enemy corpse!
he interrupted himself violently: no, that’s not what i must say
the two girls dropped their eyes
after some moments’ thought, he invited his two visitors with a sign to be seated, and addressed compère tourangeau
this victim’s body was something special for them, endowed with an almost religious splendour
as he explained their chances of success and mâtho’s weakness, she seemed to be rejoicing in some extraordinary hope
but most often mâtho, melancholy as an augur, went off at daybreak to roam over the countryside
the old woman was bent double, dressed in rags, a duster over her doddery head, with little slit eyes; she was wrinkled all over, on hands, face, neck; her lips sank in under her gums, and all round her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which made her look like a contented cat
we’ll help monsieur the bailiff
he was amazed at the small number of children
they were seized with renewed frenzy, and the numidians carried all the others away with them
nothing stirred; the eternal mountain seemed to them higher every morning
messieurs, you common people of paris!
no one raised his head more proudly and radiantly than i priests consulted me on chastity, learned doctors on doctrine
as to the steps, it is time which has caused them to disappear, by slowly and irresistibly raising the ground level of the city
what do you accuse me of?
at the end of a long stretch of grassland the lake of hippo-zarytus shone beneath the setting sun
and at the paris boucherie those scaffolds representing the fortress of dieppe!
others, who were watching, began to cry with terror, and the lions, perhaps recalling the feast, stretched out yawning against the edge of the pits
it was, in fact, a rather confused mêleé of all the philosophies, daydreams, wisdoms of mankind
however, an army was needed
but at that moment the archdeacon seemed not to be of this world
the unfortunate girl dropped her head into her hands, and the stranger began rowing furiously towards the bank
every day she sent food into the temples
dom claude gestured impatiently
all had recognized him and held their breath
the joy was delirious!
her body filled the entire ceiling
look, master, see, that group of dark roofs at peculiar angles, there, beneath that heap of low, ragged, dirty, smeared clouds, where the moon looks all squashed and spread out like an egg yolk when the shell is broken—it’s a fine mansion
i’ve just pulled you out of their hands
between the old church and him there was an instinctive sympathy so profound and magnetic, and material affinities so numerous, that he somehow adhered to it like the tortoise to its shell
others defended themselves to the end; they were killed from a distance, by stoning, like mad dogs
spendius heard him groaning and talking to himself
in his youth he had studied at the college of mogbeds, at borsippa, near babylon; then visited samothrace, pessinus, ephesus, thessaly, judaea, the temples of the nabataeans, lost in the sands; and had followed on foot the course of the nile, from the cataracts to the sea
but so far no one showed himself, and the seven avenues leading from the barriers to the colossus were completely empty
so peace was going to be made, and now it would be final!
you must give it to me
the master-surgeon, to whose house the soldiers of the watch had carried him in the first instance, had feared for his life for a week, and had even told him so in latin
the rope round her neck trailed behind her
he leaned against a tree to prevent himself falling, his heart was beating so fast
they want to bring about your death!
the war, by keeping him far away, had so far prevented him from doing it; and since they had come back to carthage he had the impression that the inhabitants suspected his scheme
to stratonicles of corinth and three merchants of alexandria, on these letters (they have come back) , athenian drachmae and  syrian gold talents
in your defence,  thought gringoire
hang my pretty djali!
good brother claude,  jehan went on, encouraged by that smile, look at the holes in my boots
she looked up and saw a reddish beam shine through the cracks in the kind of door or trap set into the ceiling of the in pace
but he shook his head, and as he saw his accumulated riches he calmed down; his thoughts, drawn by the perspective of the corridors, spread over other rooms full of rarer treasures
around the room were arranged ebony stools
it was the king on his throne
but very soon it would begin to run away or would vanish into a hole
the inadequacy of preventive measures was sufficient proof that they were deemed impossible
hamilcar is away; the people loathe the rich; gisco has no control over the cowards who surround him
at the very moment that i was thinking thus, i saw a goat beside you, a beast from the sabbath, looking at me and laughing
shoot at the windows,  cried clopin
beneath it lay a small star, and all around a pale circle
they demanded wine, food, gold
then he would lead the west into the conquest of iberia; and without asking why he had not come sooner, or challenging any of his lies, he kissed narr’havas, striking his chest three times against his own
narr’havas made a great gesture of surprise, then fell upon his hands and covered them with kisses
i don’t want to see you die!
the gypsy saw the soldiers approaching
why perpetually change your shape?
they saw quasimodo standing on the parapet of the gallery, holding the student by the feet in one hand and whirling him over the abyss like a sling
the ground became gradually softer, their feet sank into it
then dom claude heard him go off, saying: it’s all the same, reason’s a fine thing, and my brother the archdeacon is indeed a lucky man to be wise and have money too
after a moment’s reflection, while he took temporary shelter beneath the small wicket-gate of the treasurer of the sainte-chapelle’s prison, as to where he might decide to spend the night, with all the cobblestones in paris to choose from, he remembered having noticed the week before, in the rue de la savaterie, in front of a parliamentary counsellor’s door, a mounting block for mule riders, which, he had thought, might, on occasion, provide an excellent pillow for a beggar or a poet
mâtho barely touched the floor encrusted with gold, mother of pearl, and glass; and despite its polished surface, it seemed to him that his feet sank in as if he were walking on sand
since they could not be cured, they might as well be delivered from their torments; and as soon as anyone faltered, all cried that now he was lost and ought to be of use to the others
jehan did not answer
you calling me, child-stealer!
still, one must not hold too much against him: had she not confessed her crime’?
it was a trick, or the complaints were pointless; and hanno’s supporters tried to discredit him by exaggerating the importance of his victory
we repeat, who can fail to see that in that form it is much more indelible?
it’s a monkey gone wrong,  observed gauchère
do you know, girl, what from then on i would see between the book and me?
mâtho stayed behind the balustrade
you will be humble, do you understand, and submit to his desire, which is the order of heaven!
she stayed for a moment without speaking
the carthaginians booed and shouted that they were cowards
yes, mother,  the girl went on, quite distraught, they want to kill me
that is monsieur le président
quite certainly,  answered the poet
and while the archdeacon went off one way, he took himself off in another, saying to himself in an undertone: this is a fine business, maître pierre gringoire
to drive back the maniples encircling them, they pivoted on their hindlegs, continually wheeling round as they went forward
at every bush their number increased: and the carthaginians, lying on the ground, heard the tramp of their feet in the dark
qui verbum meum audit, et credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam aeternam et injudicium non venit; sed transit a morte in vitam
a pack of dogs barked
they were as still as the mountain and the dead
it is certain that nothing less than jupiter’s intervention could have saved the four unfortunate sergeants of the bailiff of the palais
then, all of a tremble, i called the watch
it’s been known for churches to defend themselves like that,  he observed with a sigh, saint sophia in constantinople, forty years ago now, threw mahomet’s crescent to the ground three times in succession by shaking its domes, which are like its heads
then, to right, to left, to east, to west, within the bounds of the city, narrow though they were, rose the steeples of its twenty-one churches, of every date, shape and size, from the low, decaying romanesque campanile of saint-denys-du-pas, career glaucini [prison of glaucinus], to the delicate spires of saint-pierre-aux-bœufs and saint-landry
the stronger ones, at the sound of the eating vessels, pulled themselves up and cried out: that was how gisco had seen salammbo
she said, will it be soon?
thenceforth the carthaginians attempted no more sorties – and they had no thought of surrender, certain that they would be tortured to death
gringoire hastened to give him as succinct an account as possible of all that the reader already knows, his adventure in the court of miracles and his marriage ceremony with the broken pitcher
in fact a lot of the ulcers have closed up
hanno replied that he had brought it
at that point the priest knelt down on the balustrade to have a better view
fine singers,  retorted the other; their voices are even sharper than their pointed caps!
some men rushed up
thank you,  she said
they came into a narrow gorge; narr’ havas smilingly informed them that he no longer knew the way; spendius found it again
he was explaining to the captains the endless burdens placed on the republic its treasury was empty
but the etruscans, fastened to their chain, did not budge; the dead, unable to fall, formed an obstacle with their corpses; and this great bronze line successively opened and closed up, supple as a serpent, unshakeable as a wall
he looked evil, haughty, and stiff-necked
after the shattering fiasco of his first attempt at drama he did not dare go back to his previous lodgings in the rue grenier-sur-l’eau, opposite the port-au-foin, having counted on what monsieur the provost was to give him for the epithalamium to pay maître guillaume doulx-sire, who farmed the tax on cloven-footed beasts in paris, the six months’ rent he owed, that is, number sols parisis; twelve times more than the value of all his worldly possessions, including his breeches, shirt, and bycocket hat
she rapidly threw a long yellow veil over her hair, wound a scarf round her neck, stuck her feet into blue leather boots and said to taanach:
however, the heads of a few priests in the distant choir-stalls could vaguely be seen moving about, and at the moment when the great door opened there came from the church the sound of a grave, sonorous, and monotonous chant, casting over the condemned woman’s head, as it were, in one gust after another, fragments of dismal psalms
then the confraternity of fools, recovering from their initial stupefaction, tried to defend their pope, who had been so rudely dethroned
what do you want?
such an act would not just have been a small patch on the face of his reputation to embellish it, but a malignant ulcer to disfigure it
quasimodo, wholly unaware of the question addressed to him, continued to stare at the judge and did not answer
how do you know?
how i’d bite you if the bars didn’t get in the way
you can see the separate undulations of each group of notes escaping from the peals; you can follow the dialogue, alternately deep and shrill, of the lightest and the heaviest bell, the rattle and the bourdon: you can see the octaves leap from one belfry to the next; you can watch them spring winged, light, and whistling from the silver bell, fall broken and lame from the wooden one; among them you can admire the rich gamut falling and rising ceaselessly from the seven bells of saint-eustache; you can see clear, rapid notes running across like three or four bright zigzags and vanishing like lightning flashes
the arrows flying round him did not seem to frighten him any more than a flock of swallows
dom claude heard the officer say to the student:
round the two main streams drops of this terrible rain were being sprinkled over the attackers, penetrating their skulls like gimlets of flame
look, there she is, where you see that bunch of halberds
i have had enough of their conversation!
suddenly they heard a plaintive chant, loud and soft, which rose and fell in the air like the wing-beats of a wounded bird
but such a presumptuous wish to mix with punic blood angered the people; they were brutally given to understand that they had nothing more coming to them
at first she walked in the darkness without meeting anyone, because all were hurrying towards the fire; and the clamour increased, huge flames reddened the sky behind; a long terrace stopped her
she’s quite capable of that
he had been brought up to keep his eyes downcast and his voice low
so the carthaginians were afraid, they were fleeing!
the soldiers, clinging to the beam, pulled back
the man in black did not let him finish
were you relying on them to kill each other so as to save you the distress of keeping your word?
to a cordelier friar for hearing a criminal’s confession, number sols parisis
clopin was interrupted by a fearful crash resounding at that moment behind him
[go now, dubious soul, and may god be merciful to you]
the great symbol of architecture, babel, is a beehive
gringoire continued in a state of exaltation
what has he engraved there on his crucible?
the greenery of the countryside disappeared in places beneath long patches of yellow; carobs shone like coral buttons; vines fell down from the tops of sycamores; the murmur of water could be heard; crested larks hopped about, and the last rays of the sun gilded the shells of the tortoises, as they came out of the reeds to sniff the breeze
let’s fetch her some scraps from the public buffet
put it to the vote!
in the fifteenth century paris was still divided into three quite distinct and separate towns, each with its own physiognomy, specialities, way of life, customs, privileges, history: the city, the university, the town
an orphan, an elder brother, head of the family at number, he felt rudely recalled from his academic dreams to the realities of the world
but let’s be friends this evening
what are you talking about, damoiselle oudarde musnier?
let’s settle for eve and her apple,  said the student; then, taking phoebus by the arm: by the way, my dear captain, a moment ago you mentioned the rue coupe-gueule
her legs went up the height of the wall
their maniples wheeled, with space between them
there was nothing mocking or ironic in the priest’s glance; it was serious, calm and piercing
do you know whom you are talking to?
there’s no one here!
from the fine of number sols paid by every barber who shaves on a feast day, number sols go to you, and we have what’s left
each one wore an iron collar, and the crowd never grew tired of coming to look at them

he turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank back on to his chest, he folded his hands, rejoined his procession of priests, and a moment later he was seen disappearing, with the cross, candles, and copes, beneath the hazy arches of the cathedral; and his sonorous voice gradually died away in the choir as he chanted the despairing verse:

my father was hanged by the burgundians and my mother ripped open by the picards at the time of the siege of paris twenty years ago
what do you want then?
salammbo turned away from this unclean food, and fell asleep on the horse cloths laid out in a corner of the room
between the suburbs of the temple and saint-martin, about number toises from the walls of paris, a few crossbow shots from la courtille, could be seen on the top of a gentle, imperceptible eminence, high enough to be visible for several leagues around, a strangely shaped structure, somewhat resembling a celtic cromlech, and where human sacrifices were also made
next came all the inferior forms of the divinity
they were almost touched
gringoire, still followed by his three persecutors, and not too sure what was going to come of all this, walked in dismay among the others, turning the cripples aside, stepping over the ones with no legs, getting his feet tangled in this anthill of the disabled, like the english captain who was sucked under by an army of crabs

the barbarians had tried at first to envelop him with small detachments; he always escaped
however, the shock had, so to speak, roused the recluse
then, beyond the grand and beyond the petit châtelet a first ring of walls and towers began to encroach on the countryside on both banks of the seine
it’s disappointing,  he said in conclusion, but it’s due to the fact that i was unlucky enough to marry a virgin

the grey dawn was just beginning
good virgin in heaven!
but when the helepolis was about thirty paces away, he ordered planks set up, above the streets, between the houses, from the cisterns to the rampart; and people formed a line, passing from hand to hand helmets and amphorae which they emptied continually

then eschmoûn unfolded in the starry space; khamon shone in the sun; melkarth, with his arms, pushed it behind gades; the cabiri went down under the volcanoes, and rabbetna, like a nurse, leaned over the world, pouring out her light like milk and her might like a mantle

cried her lively companions; and they all rushed to the edge of the balcony, while fleur-de-lys, preoccupied with her fiance’s coolness, slowly followed them and he, relieved by this incident which cut short an uncomfortable conversation, went back inside the apartment with the contented look of a soldier whose duty is over
drome-daries, smeared with pitch like boats, knocked over women carrying children at their hips

they began others in different places; hamilcar always guessed their direction by putting his ear to a bronze shield

the carthaginians were still horror-stricken by their arrival when they saw, coming straight towards them, what looked like monsters and buildings, with their masts, arms, rigging, joints, roofs, and carapaces, the siege engines sent by the tyrian towns: sixty carrobalistae, eighty onagers, thirty scorpions, fifty swing beams, twelve rams, and three gigantic catapults which hurled boulders weighing fifteen talents
but for her, where would you be?
how right i am not to drink and how excellently saint benedict puts it: vinum apostatare facit enim sapientes [wine makes even wise men go astray]
this show was as good as any other
so it was all the rage
enormous wineskins bristling with pipes made a shrill splashing; tambourines, beaten with the full force of the arm, rang out with dull and rapid bangs; and, despite the frenzy of the trumpets, the salsalim clicked like the wings of a cricket

finally, as if africa had not been sufficiently emptied and, to assemble still more furies, it had been necessary to go to the dregs among races, there could be seen, behind all the others, men with the features of animals and giggling with idiot laughs; wretches ravaged by hideous diseases, deformed pygmies, mulattoes of dubious sex, albinos with red eyes blinking at the sun; as they mouthed unintelligible sounds, they put a finger in their mouth to show that they were hungry

at last, exhausted with struggling and anger, he fell into a wild slumber
sire, your majesty knows that simon radin is dead?
are you going to believe all these words?

the apartment they entered contained nothing but a black painting representing another woman
it was pitch dark

to sum up what we have so far sketched very roughly, ignoring countless proofs and also countless objections of detail, it comes to this: architecture up to the fifteenth century was the principal record of mankind; during that time no concept of any complexity appeared in the world which was not made into a building; every popular idea like every religious law has had its monuments; finally, the human race never had an important thought which it did not write down in stone

number livres number sols number deniers parisis
his face all grey and drawn and hollow-eyed because he’s so fond of gambling and dice!
hamilcar, emerging suddenly from the bottom of the gorge, had come down on the western slope overlooking hippo-zarytus and, as there was more room at that point, had been careful to draw the barbarians there
on the thread holding her suspended over the abyss, a score of times she had thought she was about to see it snap, and she was at last beginning to breathe again and feel her feet on firm ground
and you say it is directed against the bailiff of the palais de justice?
the greeks, strapped into their iron swordbelts, listened and tried to make out his words, while the mountaineers, covered in furs like bears, looked at him suspiciously or yawned, leaning on their bronze-studded clubs
was he trying to join the mercenaries?
that’s not a child, agnès
at the back was a table covered with fleurs-de-lys, with a great carved oak armchair, which was the provost’s, and empty, and a stool on the left for the auditor, maître florian

if they turned to the east they would join the nomads, intercept the road to cyrene and desert trade

this met with loud cheers
when your gypsy mother comes to claim you, i’ll tell her: mother, look at that gibbet!

let us add that it is the rule that a building’s architecture should be so adapted to its intended function that that function should be self-evident simply from the appearance of the building
sometimes, from end to end, broad currents flowed down, then went up again, and in the middle a heavy mass remained motionless
so you deny it?
from time to time he looked up at the roof
from afar they recognized the markets, the crossroads; they argued about the siting of the temples: khamon’s, facing the syssitia, had golden tiles; melkarth’s, to the left of eschmoûn, carried branches of coral on its roof; tanit’s, beyond, filled out its copper cupola among the palm-trees; black moloch was below the water-tanks, towards the lighthouse
several times they were repulsed, but came back again; mâtho made narr’havas’s cavalry charge them with lances; and as the balearics cried out that they needed women:
i have also written a book which will run to six hundred pages on the prodigious comet of number, which drove one man mad

the usher’s brutal monologue, however, came to an end

mâtho, naked as a corpse, was lying prone on a lion skin, his face in his hands; a hanging lamp shone on his weapons, fastened above his head against the tent pole
he had come that day to spend the night at the bastille
it grew bare, its leaves fell off, it wasted visibly away, it was mean, poor, of no account
first i loved women, then animals
picture to yourself in fact, on this seat of rich cordovan leather, two knock-knees, two skinny thighs shabbily dressed in black woollen knitted hose, a torso wrapped in a fustian cloak with a fur trimming showing more hide than hair; finally, to crown it all, a greasy old hat of the meanest black cloth with a circular band of lead figurines running round it
his chest heaved with a deep sigh
the crowd was full of admiration
the whole of this little court swooned in their cassocks with ecstasy over this pun

she is fond of crafty men
she made her scornful little pout, cocked her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the dainty little dagger disappeared as it had emerged, without gringoire being able to see where the bee hid its sting
some came to offer him sacks, containing the heads of mercenaries whom they claimed to have killed, but which they had cut from corpses; for many had got lost as they fled, and they were found dead in various places, under olive trees or in vineyards
they melted in the heat of the candles burning near them; the paint ran on to their shoulders and tears streamed down the faces of the living, who stood to one side chanting mournful dirges

it is ten o’clock in the morning
the man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside
it is the hive to which the golden bees of imagination bring their honey
but the archdeacon still protested, objecting that the legate’s ordinance, which went back to number, was a hundred and twenty-seven years earlier than the black book, and was consequently, as a matter of fact, abrogated by it
the towers of saint-sulpice are two huge clarinets, a shape as shapes go; the crooked, grinning telegraph makes a pleasant contrast on their roofline
then, when he was on top, near the corpse, he let it down again
the captain of the bastille walked at their head and had the wickets opened to the sickly, stooping old king, who coughed as he walked
the enormous silhouette of the two towers, extending far over the rooftops of paris, scooped out of all this brightness a broad patch of shadow

at its front section a cylinder, fitted with cables, held a large beam carrying a scoop for projectiles; its base was fastened by a skein of twisted strands, and when the ropes were released, it rose up, striking against the bar, which, halting it with a jerk, increased its force
he offered to send for some from carthage; then, like the others, they accepted money
they burned in the dark, here and there, like beacons half-hidden in the mist; and nothing was to be seen moving on the plain but the rippling of the river, swollen with corpses which it was carrying to the sea

i’ll tear out your horrid grey hair in handfuls and throw it in your face
they have only to come here
narr’havas tilted his chin as a sign of disdain; there was not one measure which he did not judge disastrous; and he no longer smiled
but a portcullis, forty cubits high, made to fit the gap exactly, suddenly came down before them, like a rampart falling from the sky

you run in the blue of your sky and i stay motionless upon the earth

there was a kind of sham soldier, narquois as they are called in argot, whistling as he unwound the dressing from his sham wound, and stretching his sound, healthy knee, wrapped up since morning in countless bindings; as the other side of the coin, a malingreux was getting his god’s leg’ ready for the morning with celandine and ox-blood

the steeple of saint-sulpice and the three tall spires of saint-germain-des-prés rose above the horizon to his right
they dragged after them some kind of shapeless sack; and were making enough noise with their clogs alone to wake the dead

i prefer my yellow and red surcoat to those iron and steel scales
but once he had set them swinging, when he felt this cluster of bells move beneath his hand, when he saw, for he could not hear, the palpitating octave go up and down on this scale of sound like a bird hopping from branch to branch, when the musical devil, that demon who shakes a dazzling bunch of stretti, trills, and arpeggios, had taken possession of the poor deaf creature, then he became happy again, he forgot everything, and his swelling heart brought a beam to his face

alas, what have you got against me?
we shall send it,  said the king with a false appearance of seriousness
gringoire was enraptured at feeling, seeing, fingering, so to speak, a whole assembly (of the baser sort, true, but what does that matter?)

continuing up the successive levels of this amphitheatre of palaces unfolding in the distance over the ground, after crossing a deep ravine cut through the roofs of the town, which marked the line of the rue saint-antoine, the eye reached—and we are still confining ourselves to the principal monuments—the logis d’angoulême, a vast structure from several different periods, some parts of which were quite new and very white, blending with the whole scarcely better than a red patch on a blue doublet

salammbo stayed still looking at him, with bowed head and folded hands
the barbarians, as though abandoning him, closed up together; and there was no word, no complaint

a naked sword leaned against a stool, beside a shield; hippopotamus-hide whips, cymbals, bells, necklets were strewn about on woven baskets; crumbs of black bread spotted a felt blanket; in a corner, on a round stone, copper money was carelessly piled up, and through tears in the canvas the wind brought the dust from outside with the smell of the elephants, who could be heard eating as they rattled their chains
meanwhile arrows spurted out from the top of the wooden towers and the stone ones

she fed the child herself, made it swaddling clothes out of her blanket, the only one she had on her bed, and no longer felt cold or hunger
but what kept them alive was love of life

at this, bursting into sobs and looking up at the priest: oh!
the night was dark, a grey mist seemed to hang heavily on the sea, which beat against the cliff with a noise of sobs and dying breaths; and shadows gradually disappeared as though they had passed through the walls

sometimes the rain from a storm hung down from the heavens like a long sash, while the whole countryside was covered by calm blue skies; then a warm wind whipped up swirls of dust – and a stream came tumbling down from the heights on which sicca stood, with its golden roof on bronze pillars, the temple of the carthaginian venus, who dominated the region

numerous arms were raised and he disappeared from view
he had recognized the rabbet’s influence, being skilled in distinguishing which gods sent down illnesses; and to cure salammbo he had her apartment sprinkled with verbena and maidenhair; every morning she ate mandragora; she slept with her head on a sachet of perfumes blended by the pontiffs; he had even used baaras, a flame-coloured root which drives away evil spirits to the north; finally, turning towards the pole star, he murmured three times the mysterious name of tanit; but as salammbo’s sickness continued, his anxiety intensified
several had boldly refused; and, determined neither to feed them nor surrender them to the grand council, he had dismissed them, ordering them not to fight again against carthage

it was a glittering cavalcade, and made the roadway ring
the suffete replied disdainfully
the face of europe has changed

they make one feel how primitive a thing architecture is by demonstrating, as the cyclopean remains, egyptian pyramids, gigantic hindu temples also demonstrate, that architecture’s greatest productions are not so much the works of individuals as of societies; the fruit of whole peoples in labour rather than the inspiration of men of genius; the deposit left by a nation; the accumulation of centuries; the residue from successive evaporations of human society; in a word, types of formation

the two animals, side by side, were now trotting, with their hooves muffled as they sank into the sand
from the smiles, the little signs of complicity of madame aloïse, the winks she directed at her daughter fleur-de-lys as she spoke quietly to the captain, it was obvious that the subject at issue was some betrothal already confirmed, some marriage doubtless forthcoming, between the young man and fleur-de-lys
she must get out of there, all the same!

the javelin whistled between the cups to go right through the libyan’s arm, pinning it so hard to the table that the grip quivered in the air
on the bed pierrat torterue, the sworn torturer, sat nonchalantly
then he began to describe the whole campaign
his train, what would today be called his staff of bishops and abbots, poured on to the tribune in his wake, exciting increased tumult and curiosity among the groundlings
the tambourine of the sacred harlots sounded from tanit’s wood, and at the tip by the mappalia the kilns for the clay coffins began to smoke
thus these four lines in her mouth expressed wild gaiety:
the gallows leads to hell
those among them who were not as pious as they ought to have been had hoped that the matter could be settled more easily in paradise than in rome, and had simply prayed to god for the deceased, instead of to the pope
you must go to the barbarians!
and tears of affection and distress ran down her cheeks, into the scars of her tattoo
what use was this thing of the gods to him?
would you care to initiate me?
he shot arrows at passing vultures
he simply writhed about on the spout in the most incredible efforts to climb up again
we poor philosophers are to a constable what a bed of cabbages and radishes is to the garden of the louvre
the student remained silent for a moment, his finger in his ear, his eyes fixed on the ground, his expression cross
so that as the greek believed he had as many gods as he had fountains, and the persian as many as he could see stars, the frenchman reckons he has as many kings as he can see gibbets!
at this sight the besieged left the rampart
and if you want to have an impression of the old city such as the modern one can no longer offer, go up, on the morning of some great festival, at sunrise on easter day or whitsun, go up to some high point overlooking the whole capital and experience the waking of the bells
post equitem sedet atra cura [dark care sits behind the rider]
fine fellows, our university people!
from every path, every ravine, men sprang up
finally the barbarians came nearer
they sprawled out on cushions, they ate squatting round great dishes, or, lying on their stomachs, pulled out bits of meat and took their fill leaning on their elbows, in the peaceful posture of lions tearing up their prey
these mighty buildings, whose method of formation and vegetation’ we have discussed elsewhere, did not simply have foundations but, so to speak, roots, whose ramifications extended into the soil as chambers, galleries, stairways, like the building constructed above
but the light stopped at the edge – and the shadow, like a great curtain, revealed only a corner of the red mattress with the tip of a small bare foot set on an ankle
the lions were resting with their chests on the ground and both paws stretched out, blinking their eyes in the bright light, made brighter by the reflection from the white rocks
the child, in anger, bit his hand until he drew blood
you are said to be a great aesculapius and i have come to ask you for some medical advice
alas, maître claude, all that stone-masonry is costing me dear
and with her other hand tore the veils from her head
but she was condemned to continual alternation of hope and alarm
an individual sacrifice was needed, a completely voluntary oblation which was considered to bring the others in its wake
the slingers, distributed in the rear, kept shooting
now i wanted a word with him, but i couldn’t get to him because of the crowd, and that is most annoying, because i’m in need of some money
several times it almost snapped
he had assumed an air of calm
because he’s one of the four official booksellers of the university!
she fell upon her knees, putting her two fingers against her ears in sign of repentance; and she sobbed, crushed by the priest’s words, full of anger against him, terror, and humiliation, all at once
as soon as gisco landed, the soldiers ran to meet him
meanwhile clopin trouillefou had finished distributing the arms
an indistinct murmur came to his ears
captain phoebus de chateâupers, at your service, my beauty!
although she asked tanit every day for mâtho’s death, her aversion for the libyan was lessening
this tartarus was simply called the question-chamber’
the bell for vespers roused me
where is the child?
gervaise repeated her question, shaking mahiette by the arm and calling out her name
he was indeed an exalted personage, the sight of whom was worth any stage spectacle
these flares flickered in the gusts of wind and reddened the golden combs fastening their braided hair at the neck
no one could ever know
narr’havas spied them from some way off in the mountains
six paces further and he fell a third, a fourth time again; and fresh torture brought him up each time
this immense baying filled carthage with dull continuity
they seemed to ignore her presence, and spoke about her, in front of her, directly to her, aloud, as if she were something rather grubby, rather despicable, and rather pretty
now it was a béjaune (the name given to newcomers in the university) whom he had treated to a very rough welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully perpetuated to our own day
and when my situation was desperate – we drank our mules’ urine and ate our sandal straps – when i would have liked the blades of grass to be soldiers, and to form battalions with our rotting dead, you recalled all the ships i had left!
so saying he cheerfully clapped him on the shoulder
as i’m doing with your gorget—girls!
i burned all their trees, sacked all their temples, and until the death of the grandsons of their grandsons…
i have never before seen my ugliness as i do now
cried the priest with a terrible look, and pushing the astonished gringoire by the shoulders, he strode away under the darkest arcades of the cathedral
how beautiful you are!
bending over, spendius finally discovered what he was watching
they slithered in the blood; the very steep slope of the ground made the corpses roll down
meanwhile she felt that some fatality surrounded her, that she was in contact with a supreme, irrevocable moment, and with an effort she went towards the zaïmph and raised her hands to seize it
it was all that was left of claude’s family
tell me, robin poussepain, who’s that fellow?
suddenly the girl saw his head reappear, a terrifying expression on his face, and he cried with a groan of rage and despair: i tell you he is dead!
besides, the popular hosier’s motion was greeted with such enthusiasm by these burghers, who felt flattered to be addressed as squires, that resistance was pointless
he cried, imitating an auctioneer’s tones, to the great delight of all: nobody wants him?
although she wanted to accuse herself, she did not dare open her lips; and yet she was choking with the need to voice her sorrow and be comforted
cried one of those on the window ledge
said tristan, what an old harridan!
the play was not due to commence until the last stroke of twelve came from the great clock in the palais
the souls of the dead,  he said, are dissolved in the moon as corpses are in the earth
he fell back, drawing in his arms, gaping, almost in terror
there now, young cousin,  she said, tugging at his sleeve so that she could speak in his ear
i think the lock’s breaking
the archdeacon and the gypsy clashed in his heart
a murmur of horror ran through the audience
i think the old girl is getting upset!
they felt the mountain with their hands, trying to find a way through
the good lady, quite obsessed by her daughter, like any poor mother, did not notice the officer’s lack of enthusiasm, and was taking great pains to point out to him in whispers the infinite perfection with which fleur-de-lys plied her needle or wound her thread
everything i’m telling you is the truth
i looked at you so hard that i suddenly shivered with terror, i felt in the grip of fate
beyond this place and this night there is nothing to be seen
while you, half wise and half foolish, empty sketch of something or other, some kind of vegetable being which believes it can walk and think, while you go on living the life of which you robbed her, useless as a candle at noonday?
claude frollo had taught him to talk, read, write
so, as a precaution, they had been carrying arms: that was a crime; they looked at each other in dismay
he was perhaps ten years old, and no taller than a roman sword
aren’t they lucky to be able to see it all,  said joannes de molendino with a sigh, still perched up on the foliage of his capital
replied one of the clerks stationed on the window ledge
present-day paris has, then, no general physiognomy
gringoire did not dare breathe or raise his eyes
i shall not do it again, and i will give you a beautiful silver statue, like the one i gave last year to our lady of ecouys
excessive pain, like excessive joy, is something violent that does not last
calculating the distance from the number of steps he took, he arrived right at the place where he had noticed a slanting crack; and for three hours, until morning, he toiled continuously, furiously, scarcely able to breathe through the chinks in the slabs above, tormented with fears and expecting to die a score of times
the dying rolled about in the bloody mud and bit their injured hands in their rage: and forty-three samnites, a whole sacred spring, slaughtered each other like gladiators
they went to look for him
her eyes were fixed on the ground
a groom came to untie the horse and led it away to the stables
i beg your pardon, my lord
he repeated: yes, i will kill her!
exclaimed fleur-de-lys, looking up with her lovely eyes brimming with tears
then he took his heavy axe, and in front and behind butchered the carthaginians like a flock of sheep
the isthmus was now completely covered with people; and this long surface, on which the tents looked like huts in a flood, spread as far as the front lines of the other barbarians, bristling with weapons and systematically established on both sides of the aqueduct
i’ve had enough of that king and his coughing!
but how were they to convey the necessity of an endless struggle to all these demoralized men, still bleeding from their wounds?
you hate me even more, i, who am their master!
besides, sire, i did not betray your majesty, it was my lord of angers
but he continued to retreat
let us go back!
it was cruel to make a tantalus of the big, chubby lad
all religions, as well as all races, were to be met with in these barbarian armies, and respect was paid to other men’s gods, because they were fearful too
someone fetched, from the peristyle of the temple of melkarth, the bar of a tripod red hot from the coals and, slipping it under the first chain, pressed it against the wound
he had first tried silently and with no great outward effort to burst his bonds
the answer you have just given, you rogue, deserves the halter!
she would be grown up now!
the ethiopian drew a long dagger from his belt, and the three heads fell
the grimace was his ordinary face
then came the throng of the baggage train, the animals, and stragglers
jehan did not dare add aloud: and a little money which i need even more
the hangman howled with pain
the losses had included , silver shekels, , gold shekels, eighteen elephants, four members of the grand council, three hundred of the rich, , citizens, corn for three months, a large amount of baggage and all the war machines!
hold your peace, old woman,  put in a stout and stately individual holding his nose as he stood beside the fishwife; a mass certainly had to be endowed
he kept wanting more
all right, student of antichrist, may you be strangled with your mother’s guts!
but what was that in the military harbour, defended by triple walls?
monsieur,  said gringoire, thank you
said the priest, letting go of her arm, you are pitiless!
to this question from the compère, dom claude was content to answer with lofty calm: whose archdeacon lam?
claude was pacing slowly and solemnly
and while captain phoebus was twirling his burgundian moustache, she slipped down from the horse, like an arrow dropping to the ground, and made off
then a dazzling light made them drop their eyes
life was coming back
he was returning to fulfil his promises; a hope which was by no means absurd, seeing how deep the gulf was between the fatherland and the army
yes, indeed, maître boniface disome!
the decree has to be executed within three days!
it was mâtho’s iberians, lusitanians, balearics, gaetulians; narr’havas’s horses could be heard whinnying; they spread round the hill; then came the motley throng commanded by autharitus; and in their midst the unclean-eaters could be recognized from the fishbones they wore in their hair
but the barbarians at each end turned out to be the weaker, especially those on the left, who had emptied their quivers, and the troop of velites, confronting them by now, made large inroads
the cardinal bit his lip
in the circular gallery into which all these corridors ran, there were stacked all along the wall blocks of algumin, sacks of lausonia (for henna), cakes of lemnos earth, and tortoiseshells full of pearls
mahiette, so overcome up till then that she could not speak, made an effort
i won’t tell you how delighted she was
time is the architect, the whole people the builder
quasimodo was surrounded, seized, trussed up
at that moment the king raised his voice
and the surrounding crowd repeated oxen!
the music outside continued; there were three notes, always the same, headlong, frenzied; the strings grated, the flute boomed; taanach kept time by clapping her hands; salammbo, her whole body swaying, chanted her prayers, and her clothes, one after another, fell round her
if you want to know, it’s pierre gringoire
no one, not even of the household, must know of his existence!
as if your sacrifice were not enough, you came to me, in my sleep, draped in the zaïmph!
he said between his gums, for he had no teeth left, we are quite prepared now for the door of the sepulchre
the sky behind sparkled with stars
who gave it to you?
mâtho stopped them, and while the carthaginian wings continued to advance, he made the three inner ranks of his line move outside them; they soon went past his flanks and his army appeared at triple length
such things are not possible
one day, it was the third of the month of tibby, he was seen rushing down from the acropolis
he told them that it was a sick boy going to seek a cure in some distant temple
thank you, maître claude
the mystery was about to begin
you will beat your breasts, you will roll in the dust and tear your garments!
yes, there is,  the hangman went on, as you know very well
at one moment she seemed like a mad woman, at the next a queen
he went on in a low voice, so that they had to listen more carefully
so there i was at my spinning-wheel
the other rams in front of the other gates began to move
these outward manifestations of joy at any piece of good news sometimes went to great lengths: thus, on the death of charles the bold, to the point of promising silver balustrades to saint-martin at tours; on his accession to the throne, to the point of forgetting to arrange his father’s obsequies
behind the silver lamp he had noticed a large blue square held up from above by four ropes, and he went forward, stooping, open-mouthed
he was sullen, silent, and calm
i deny,  dom claude said coldly, neither the pharmacy nor the patient
in a twinkling the great hall was empty
he made her kneel down, and keeping his right hand raised and his left stretched out, he swore on her behalf to bring back tank’s mantle to carthage
then she was seized with impatience; she pressed taanach to hurry, and the old slave grumbled:
so do not judge me guilty of sedition and pillage because my clothes are out at the elbows
suddenly his deep-set eyes took on such a shrewdly penetrating expression that gringoire felt, so to speak, probed in his innermost soul by that look
oh goodness, it seems to be the turn of the windows now
they started off again
and when the slaves, in fear and trembling, confessed that they were in the hands of general gisco they cried:
she was already lisping, laughed at her mother like a little mad thing, was plump and chubby, and had lots of sweet little gestures like an angel from paradise
it isn’t hebrew, it’s latin
preparations for the sacrifice had already begun
the material gaping wide over his shoulders hid his face in shadow, and nothing showed but his blazing eyes staring ahead
hamilcar snatched the cloth strips from his hands
jehan whistling at its head completed the illusion
robin chief-de-ville, hauberk maker!—for having been passed and admitted master of the said trade?—that’s his entrance fee
it had been wrapped in ox-hides; iron hoops ran round it at intervals; it was three times thicker than a man’s body, a hundred and twenty-five cubits long, and pushed back and forth by a mass of bare arms it swung to and fro in a regular beat
several of them had tears at the bottom of their robes stopped by a strip of purple, clear evidence that they had not spared their garments in mourning the death of near relatives, and this sign of affliction prevented the rent from spreading
yes killed, all of them, all!
against the bright horizon the villages stood out darkly, in jumbled and jagged shapes
all that could be seen on the plain was a sort of black swarm, from the blue gulf to the white lagoon; and the lake, where blood had flowed, spread out beyond like a great pool of purple
oh, it is all your fault!
here’s a drinking bowl,  went on another man, hitting him in the chest with a broken pitcher
between the rows of these equal discs were dug holes, like those of the urns in a columbarium
he vaguely remembered this popular mob, and thought he recognized all the heads which, a few months earlier, had hailed him pope of fools
if the reader, after contemplating the lively, noisy scene being played out in every part of the square, will now turn his eyes on to that ancient half-gothic, half-romanesque house of the tour-roland, which stands at the western corner of the quayside, he will observe in the angle of the façade a large public breviary, richly illuminated, protected from the rain by a little canopy, and from thieves by a grille, which, however, leaves room to turn the pages
but what have you been up to these past two months and more, you wicked man?
he is strong, isn’t he?
in the days of jupiter’s pagans, when the people offered up in the churches a hundred oxen and a hundred ewes, the emperors would give a hundred lions and a hundred eagles
the vanity of science!
i have a lair and i’ll drag you there
she was afraid of gisco, and it seemed to her that cries and footsteps were pursuing her
the shimmer of the material, like the splendour of her skin, was something special and peculiar to her
the elephants came into this mass of men; the spurs on their fronts divided them, the lances on their tusks turned them over as if they had been ploughshares; they cut, chopped, hacked with the sickles on their trunks; the towers, full of fire arrows, looked like moving volcanoes; all that could be made out was a great mass in which human flesh formed white spots, bronze plates, grey patches, blood-red splashes; the horrible animals, going through the middle of all this, dug out black furrows
for us kings, our dogs must be lions and our cats tigers
he cried, i’m going to change your nickname
she spent whole days on top of her terrace, leaning against the balustrade, passing the time by looking ahead
they were fleeing before the army
if i knew where the hem of your garment was trailing, i should cling to it with both hands, and you would have to give me back my child!
mâtho, in the middle of the ruins, turned round to call his comrades
at that moment bérangère de champchevrier, a slender little girl of number, who was looking down into the square through the trefoil apertures of the balcony, exclaimed: oh!
but hamilcar grew annoyed at such loquacity
louis xi watched him with some anxiety
without delay, the intendants of the houses and officials of the republic were strangled in the baths; old weapons were retrieved from caves where they had been hidden; swords were forged from ploughshares; children sharpened javelins at the gates, and women gave their necklets, their rings, their earrings, anything that might help in destroying carthage
have you any knowledge of that?
coictier, who had eagerly come closer to the book, could not help exclaiming it: well!
hamilcar had stopped talking
autharitus, the one he had wounded at hamilcar’s, addressed him
however, the child she was dragging along fell over on his knees; she stopped, out of breath
there are always some to be found!
i imagine,  said agnès la herme, that it’s a beast, an animal, the offspring of a jew and a sow; in fact, something that’s not christian and ought to be thrown into the water or the flames
with one exception, however
he never took his eyes off the gypsy girl, and while the wild number-year-old danced and leaped about to the delight of all, his private reverie seemed to become more and more sombre
but the returning master is like tammouz resuscitated; and beneath your gaze, father, joy and a new life will burst out everywhere!
a moment later a loaf of rye bread, a slice of bacon, some shrivelled apples, and a jug of beer lay on the table
the living being which still existed in him vaguely thought of going back
he was sure now that she had given way in a barbarian’s embrace; he was shaking, raised his two fists
you will stand on tiptoe, as i said; that will bring you within reach of the dummy’s pocket; you’ll search it; you’ll pull out a purse that’s in there; and if you do all that without anyone hearing one of the bells tinkle, that’s fine; you’ll be a truand
a few lingering stars were fading out at various points, and there was one very brilliant one in the east in the brightest part of the sky
oh, why did the baals not grant me that mercy!
a visible shudder went right through his body
he writhed on his bed at the knowledge that the brown-skinned girl was so near
you had your teeth into a very decent bit of our paris!
shrill laughter, small children squalling, women’s voices
we will get the rich to condemn you!
it is impossible to imagine the liberties taken by architects of that time, even towards the church
as for pierre gringoire, he managed to save the goat and had some success as a writer of tragedy
after a moment or two he stubbed his foot on an obstacle; he stumbled and fell
he sheathed his sword again
as he uttered those last words, his manner became quite distraught
he was respected for his courage, above all for his strength
some thought they were at a feast, and sang
hamilcar went back with muffled tread, feeling the walls round him: and he arrived in the great hall where the moonlight came in through one of the gaps in the dome; in the middle the slave, replete, slept, lying full length on the marble pavement
even the hermetics find in the symbolism of that great doorway a satisfying summary of their science, of which the church of saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie was so complete a hieroglyph
put in clopin, and truand?
he decreed that all able-bodied citizens should be enrolled, he put catapults on the towers, he demanded exorbitant stocks of arms, he even ordered the construction of fourteen galleys that were not needed; and he wanted everything registered, carefully written down
the clamour was heart-rending
hamilcar remained for a long while as though lost in thought; at last he said:
i’m sure he goes to the witches’ sabbath
like civilization it has turned the page, and the new spirit of the times finds it ready to write at its dictation
you will become almost immortal and invincible
i am grateful to you for letting me spend another pleasant quarter of an hour
those half-erased memories, almost wiped away by an excess of suffering, were revived by the sombre figure before her, just as invisible letters traced with sympathetic ink stand out bold and fresh on blank paper when brought close to a fire
besides, although they aroused no great wonder, examples of this kind of claustration in the midst of towns were, in fact, frequent, as we have just said
i say, sire, that you may be right, that the hour of the people has not yet come in your kingdom
i have an appointment with a woman
in quasimodo the archdeacon had the most obedient of slaves, the most docile of servants, the most vigilant of watchdogs
whence the vast quantity of cathedrals all over europe, so prodigious a number as to be hardly credible even when verified
the most honoured embassy of the duke of austria’ brought the cardinal no such worries, but bothered him in another way
the block of stone which formed the base of this repulsive structure was hollow
the name of some big feast-day, anyhow!
at times, however, as in the case of the killers of petit-jean, the paris executioner, and in that of emery rousseau, jean valleret’s murderer, secular justice went over the church’s head and proceeded to execute its sentence; but short of a parliamentary decree, woe betide anyone who violated a place of asylum by force of arms!
the customary of the provostry and viscounty of paris had not yet been worked on by president thibaut baillet and roger barmne, advocate to the king
torture me with one hand, but caress me with the other!
immediately he tore his clothes and rolled about on the floor with shrill cries:
the pyre alight on the platform still blazed, and lit up the town in the distance
the slave at once settled her back on the cushions
her hands were clasped together, her eyes fixed
but the play was done for
he thus returned beneath the dark vaulting of the staircase
he went to the window: oh!
sheep bleated, frightened by the storm
the altar inspired dread
to see the harlot swing
finally he knocked seven times with his thumb; and a whole part of the wall turned as a single block
they were bound at wrist and ankle, and the sombre veils prevented them from seeing anything or being recognized
the people fleeing from arras
a merchant of samos, a certain hipponax, coming from carthage, had told them that a plot was afoot for their escape, and the barbarians were advised to be ready for anything; the republic was powerful
go and fetch schahabarim
he had found that quite natural on the part of people who, like her, had no prospect other than charmolue and torterue, and who did not ride like him in the realm of the imagination between pegasus’ two wings
mâtho stayed leaning against the wall; spendius, drawing closer, went on in a low voice:
those who were moving stopped; the dying propped themselves up on an elbow and turned round to bless her
all these gates were strong and beautiful too, for beauty does not detract from strength
i love your sword
the people’s murmur, continuous as the sound of the sea, floated vaguely round the feast and seemed to cradle it in some wilder harmony; some recalled the mercenaries’ banquet; people gave themselves up to happy dreams; the sun began to sink, and the crescent moon was already rising in the other part of the sky
there was not a light to be seen
they stayed a long time without speaking
kill me as well!
the gypsy, who had come as far as the entrance to the cell, saw with surprise the roles abruptly changed
in despair i went in as an apprentice carpenter in the timber trade; but i wasn’t strong enough
are you sure,  claude continued with his penetrating gaze, that it’s only a word and not a name?
for two new sleeves on the king’s old doublet—number sols
his friend replied, staggering along: you like saying so, phoebus, but it has been proved that plato had the profile of a hunting-dog
we do not know if he suddenly realized all these ideas, but featherbrained as he was, he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen, that he had just surprised his elder brother’s soul in one of its most secret attitudes, and that claude must never suspect this
such a sight would have rent the heart of anyone but a judge
he would have liked to be able to bring the pillory crashing to the ground, and if the lightning in his eye could have struck her, the gypsy would have been reduced to dust before reaching the platform
what was …’; he corrected himself: what is the bailiff’s feudal jurisdiction?
they were beggars and truands travelling through those parts, led by their duke and their counts
carthage was beginning to suffer from thirst
thus, after such hopes, they were back in a much more deplorable situation; but they tried not to think about it and even not to talk about it
the gypsy girl turned round again
his lascivious mouth left red marks on the girl’s throat
charmolue picked up the gypsy’s tambourine from a table and, presenting it to the goat in a certain way, asked it: what time is it?
behind a mountain rose other mountains, and in the middle of the vast lake stood an island all black in colour and pyramidal in shape
every time children caught her eye or her ear the poor mother would rush to the darkest corner of her tomb, and it was as if she was trying to bury her head in the stone so that she would not hear them
you were not there either!
some went to billets in the houses, others camped at the foot of the walls, and the townspeople came to talk to the soldiers
some said that the women, the sick, and the old should be sent away; others proposed abandoning the town and setting up a colony far away
zarxas seized his sling; from prudence or savagery spendius stopped him
that question, ill-advised at the moment that eustache put it, revived mahiette’s attention
phoebus counted the coins, and turning solemnly to jehan: do you know, jehan, there are number sols parisis there!
that master, however, bent over an enormous manuscript, decorated with strange paintings, seemed tormented by some idea which constantly intruded on his meditations
he snatched the register from maître olivier’s hands, and began counting up for himself on his fingers, studying in turn the paper and the cage
then the garamantes began slowly to prowl around
as the street dancer said this, gringoire was particularly struck by her beauty, which seemed to be in perfect harmony with the almost oriental exaltation of the words
[give of your charity!
he had long ago discovered the truth, that jupiter created men in a fit of misanthropy and throughout the wise man’s life his fate lays siege to his philosophy
he said, after examining the object, found apparently on the parapet of the river phlegethon!
the acropolis was covered over with coloured awnings; the spurs of the triremes, drawn up in line outside the mole, shone like a bank of diamonds; everywhere was a sense of order restored, a new existence beginning, immense happiness spread far and wide: it was the wedding day of salammbo and the king of the numidians
the crow flies only by day,
without question,  he answered, his thoughts elsewhere
i don’t know how i filled in the time between number and number here a fruit seller would give me a plum, there a baker would throw me a crust; at night i would get myself picked up by the watch, who would put me in prison, and there i’d find a bundle of straw
the hôtel de ville!
and the men who own them do not even have a sword to defend them!
messire,  said liénarde
didn’t you say his name was marc cenaine, the butler from the audit office?
the priest saw her emerge from below like some dazzling apparition
the tribes who had abandoned the siege of carthage, were thus wandering through the provinces, waiting for a chance, some victory of the mercenaries, to come back
she tried once more to face up to this new incident
among the grotesque figures carved on the wall was one of which he was particularly fond, and with which he often seemed to be exchanging fraternal looks
for a long time his slaves had been bringing waterskins on the perimeter path, where they had built with clay two transverse bulkheads forming a kind of basin
here’s the stevedores’ ladder from the port saint-landry
there’ll be time for them to sack the bailiff’s residence twenty times over, violate his authority, and hang the bailiff
and the fine doors?
and if i make the bells jingle?
are you not ashamed that a woman should make you suffer so much?
you have a whole army which has not fought, and your men obey you
with the sense of security, hope had returned to her
gringoire took her by the hand, his companion picked up the lantern and walked in front
the two armies drew nearer, were about to touch
her voice failed her
thus, stone-deaf as he was, he was relishing, like a real pope, the acclamations of this crowd which he hated because he felt hated by them
their trunks, daubed with red lead, stood up straight in the air, like red serpents; a spear was fitted on their chests, their backs were armoured, their tusks extended by curved steel blades like sabres – and to make them fiercer they had been made drunk with a mixture of pepper, neat wine, and incense
claude frollo was no longer in notre-dame when his adoptive son so abruptly cut through the fatal knot in which the unhappy archdeacon had trapped the gypsy girl and trapped himself
it was the hour after which no stranger might remain in the cloister
and a moment later she gave this verse such a tone that gringoire felt the tears spring to his eyes:
in all these different places he enjoys rights over thoroughfares, high, middle, and low justice, and is fully lord
their bodies were shamefully mutilated; the priests burned their hair to torment their souls; they were hung up in bits in butchers’ shops; some even sank their teeth in them, and in the evening, to finish it off, bonfires were lit at cross-roads
against the duke too, sometimes

alas, master,  the other said with a sad smile, i keep on at my bellows
when he had finished, the poor wretch extended his black lips, no doubt to kiss the lovely hand that had just come to his aid
and more than one called pâquerette!, and she was lost—eustache don’t let me see you biting that cake!—we could see straight away she was lost one sunday when she came to church with a gold cross round her neck—at number, just imagine!

the soldiers, eye of baal
she uttered a cry and fell among her women, who busied themselves around her
no, i don’t know him
the master is really too kind

by this system crops were always abundant, stud-farms skilfully managed, plantations superb
if you were less preoccupied with the fine clothes of the army, monsieur the archdeacon, i would ask you to go and look at that door
after a moment this made a word which the goat had seemingly been trained to write, for it composed it with so little hesitation, and bérangère suddenly cried out, clasping her hands together in wonder:
who cut your arm off?
it’s fire, molten lead, thousands of knives in my heart!
the length of time it was taking to come, according to their conjectures, made its imminent arrival certain

there’s a face would bring about an abortion better than any medicines or pharmatics!
it was a sort of monstrous hive, humming day and night
she is the soul of carthage,  the priest continued; and although she extends everywhere, it is here that she lives, under the sacred veil
the search did indeed appear to be continuing there
one man, however, was walking imperturbably up and down in front of the rowdy tavern, constantly looking inside and straying from it no further than a pikeman from his sentry-box
he was laid low by an arquebus
from deep in their chests they produced raucous and hollow tones; their eyes, fixed on the colossus, shone in the dust, and they swayed their bodies at regular intervals, all together, as if rocked by the same movement
that’s a lot of iron,  said the king, to contain the lightness of a spirit!
then she sank back into her immobility and marmoreal silence
the carthaginians walked through the camp, surprised by the amount of stuff with which it was crammed
spendius murmured, i do not like these extraordinary coincidences; the suffete comes back, narr’havas goes away…!
oudarde looked, and saw in the corner on which the recluse’s eyes were fixed in such sombre ecstasy, a little, pink, satin shoe embroidered with hundreds of gold and silver spangles
in the evening she returned home
when do we see his gallows one?
i don’t see why,  he said, poets shouldn’t be included among the truands
the king went back up to his retreat in silence, and his train followed him, terror-struck at the condemned man’s final groans
caritatemr sang the blind man
let’s be on our guard
i own a fief in the rue tirechappe, and all the women are in love with me, as true as it’s true that saint eloy was an excellent goldsmith, and that the five trades of the good town of paris are the tanners, the tawers, the baldric makers, the purse makers, and the cordwainers, and that saint lawrence was grilled on eggshells
the gods protect you, you will become rich
human life for the great as for us is a mixture of good and bad
narr’havas saw him, crossed the lake shore and came to warn hanno to send men to hamilcar’s assistance
once past theology he had plunged into the study of decretals
a large furnace, which he had not noticed at first, stood on the left of the chair, under the window
this man, who made the legions tremble and whom she hardly knew, terrified her like a god; he had guessed, he knew everything, something terrible was going to happen
he was filled with fury, and filled with fear
she had miscalculated her strength in facing the question
his tent was at the end, three hundred paces from hamilcar’s rampart
guillaume longuejoue would beat me
the end of the world is at hand!
a lusitanian of gigantic stature, carrying a man at the end of each arm, passed along the tables spitting fire from his nostrils
she opened her lips
meanwhile the barbarians were growing impatient, they began to murmur, everyone called out to him
we must not disturb her,  oudarde said in a low voice; she is in her ecstasy, she’s praying
i cannot do anything for you!
there came to reims one day a very odd lot of riders
clopin left the tavern
he called you cowards, thieves, liars, dogs and sons of bitches!
the death of them all was certain and imminent
he threw himself, then, into loving his little jehan with all the passion of a character already profound, ardent, and single-minded
despite their position, the extraordinary courage… ah!
then without stopping salammbo related how melkarth, having conquered masisabal, cut off his head and stuck it on the prow of his ship
the gauls, out of pride, took off their tunics; they displayed from afar their great white bodies; to frighten the enemy they enlarged their wounds
some traces of that ancient enclosure still existed into the last century; today all that remains is the memory, here and there a tradition, the porte baudets or baudoyer, porta bagauda
i felt more inclined to be a schoolmaster; it’s true i couldn’t read; but that’s no bar
then the poor wretch, unable to burst the bonds which chained him like a wild animal, grew quiet again
then he gave a dreadful laugh, and suddenly paled again as he contemplated the most sinister aspect of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, poisonous, hateful, implacable love whose only outcome had been the gallows for one of them, hell for the other: she condemned, he damned
her tears suddenly ceased
the bustle increased, doors closed, all the priests took flight, and the elders disappeared beneath the pillars which formed a deep vestibule around the temple
the priest had stumbled to the stairs
he had caught it
with his eyes fixed unwaveringly on a certain spot, he remained motionless and silent; and there was something about this silence and immobility so fearsome that the savage bell-ringer trembled before it and did not dare risk a clash
who was it then?
and running his eyes over the document: pure magic, maître jacques!
but he remained quite silent, gazing at her fixedly, or else he spoke at length, and his reproaches were harsher than ever
you are about to learn everything
he was the first to break the silence: so you were telling me to come back?
when the alarm bell booms, when the cannons roar, when the keep tumbles down with a great crash, when citizens and soldiers yell and kill each other, that will be the hour striking
what a blot on the name of alexander if he had had aristotle hanged!
mahiette came, very moved, in silence and on tiptoe, as one does approaching a deathbed
what had caused such a mood?
i don’t even steal any more, i’m above all that, i kill
cried the king, that’s an outrageous cage!
her gaze was dull and demented
taanach, take your nebal and play very softly on your silver string, for my heart is sad!
then less out of greed than for show, and to prove to himself that he was well, he attacked cheese and tarragon stuffing, filleted fish, pumpkins, oysters, with eggs, horseradish, truffles, and kebabs of little birds
it was like a gradually increasing pyramid
the lamp made great patterns of iridescent light play over the panels
here are three sculptures in the round by jean maillevin
loaves dusted with aniseed alternated with great cheeses, weighing more than discuses, bowls full of wine, and pots full of water beside golden filigree baskets containing flowers
then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of tisane
from his skinny, wrinkled hand one could guess that he was an old man
he had let himself be led and pushed, carried, perched, bound and bound again
salammbo had taken part in this indirectly; she was included in the same resentment; she must be punished
it was therefore decided that the finest heads of hair among plebeian wives would be chosen
i am expecting someone

on top of a mast planted before spendius’ tent a scrap of green cloth appeared: it was the signal
he answered: blessings on you!
hamilcar’s men found this such a good joke that they roared with laughter
hurry up, arm yourselves!
one evening as they were walking together through the streets of the camp, they noticed some men in white cloaks; among them was narr’havas, prince of the numidians
these cups, adorned with an emerald vine on each of their six golden facets, belonged to a militia composed exclusively of young patricians, those who were tallest
is it a conquered town, or the palace of a chief?
child, do you know that those tears are burning lava?
no, my lord,  the old woman replied, except that in the report they described my house as a stinking, dilapidated old hovel, which is most offensive language
what does that matter!
when he had broken the arrow, quasimodo gave a noisy snort, sprang like a grasshopper, and fell upon the student, whose armour was flattened against the wall by the blow
traders, scribes, workers in the arsenal, whole families went along to the barbarians’ camp
the city then had five bridges: three on the right, the pont notre-dame and the pont-au-change of stone, the pont-aux-meuniers of wood; two on the left, the stone petit-pont and the wooden pont saint-michel; all with houses on them
the reflections resulting from such refraction were inevitably divergent and deviant
[john number: number—he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death into life]
the gate was raised, and the trireme disappeared beneath the deep vault
the stupefaction written on his features gave way to a mood of bitter, profound dejection
finally he came into khamon’s square, where the balearics had perished; mâtho stopped, blenching like a man about to die
at the head of the pont-aux-changeurs, behind which one could see the seine foaming beneath the mill-wheels of the pont-aux-meuniers, stood the châtelet, no longer a roman tower as it was under julian the apostate, but a thirteenth-century feudal tower, of stone so hard that in three hours with a pickaxe you could not chip away a hand’s thickness
the president continued bluntly: then how do you explain the facts with which you are charged?
you look like a fury’s breast!
at the time some kind of stories were circulating about a bogeyman-monk prowling the streets of paris by night, and he vaguely recalled them
the wall at that spot had been abandoned, because the cliff was so inaccessible
they went off in isolated detachments, or straggled with long intervals between each group
he had simply gone back to rejoin his company, in garrison at queue-en-brie, in the île-de-france, a few stages from paris
but tristan had not gone yet
his hate could now see a definite prey; and as it became easier to imagine revenge, he thought he almost had it and was filled with delight
the archbishop took an interest in the gypsy child, he exorcised it, blessed it, carefully drove the devil out of its body, and sent it to paris to be put out on the wooden bed at notre-dame as a foundling
i don’t understand at all,  gringoire answered
the man, the artist, the individual are erased from these great masses with no author’s name; they are a summary of human intelligence and represent its sum total
among so many wonderful engravings, there is one etching in particular representing, so it is supposed, doctor faustus, which any viewer must find quite dazzling
it was quite remarkable that with all that physical strength, developed to such an extraordinary degree, quasimodo should have blindly put it at the disposal of another
that’s how i am made
he is the devil,  added a third
in the corner of a wall a man stepped back, frightened by this sparkling thing going through the darkness
the poor girl had summoned up her courage in vain
what would there be at the end if everything came at the beginning?
this caused quarrels and fights among them
haven’t you ever had a cub?
one such may have romanesque feet, a gothic middle, a graeco-roman head
it formed, as it does today, an irregular trapezium, bounded on one side by the river quay, and on the other three by a series of tall, narrow, gloomy houses
the crowd thronged the streets
but for the present they could not disguise their anxiety, they were too pale; the crowd awaiting them at the gates escorted them to the palace to extract some news from them
the trumpets had stopped blowing
as for the mercenaries’ pay, it filled roughly two wicker panniers; in one of them could even be seen some of those leather discs which the republic used to save coins; and as the barbarians looked quite amazed, hanno told them that, since the accounting was too difficult, the elders had not had time to examine it
however, as the newcomer did not utter a word, he did not know what to think
—the maréchal de clermont was hauled off bodily’—and so on
he felt as if he were made of stone, too heavy to flee
rym answered with a negative gesture, accompanied by an anxious smile
we’ll see which will win, face-pulling or the literary arts
he looked like a giant, broken into pieces and then badly mended
with daybreak the mercenaries were amazed to see all the carthaginians thus entrenched as though in a fortress
the archdeacon did not even look up at him
o barbedienne, you clod!
beyond the tower balustrade, exactly beneath the spot where the priest had stopped, there was one of those fancifully carved stone waterspouts which bristle all over gothic buildings, and in a crevice of this spout, two pretty wallflowers in bloom, shaking and almost brought alive by the breeze, were greeting each other with playful bows
at the same time she began to speak, but in tones so beseeching, so gentle, so submissive and so harrowing, that around tristan more than one old sergeant who would have eaten human flesh was wiping his eyes
she said, the fact is i am breaking a vow… i’ll never find my parents again… the amulet will lose its virtue—but what of it?
beside it could be made out the decaying roofs and unpaved precinct of the court of miracles
at that name spendius gave a start
it enclosed monsters without feeling, incoherent parts of forms to be born and which are painted on sanctuary walls
as to what you said, i did not understand; but i saw that you wanted to drag me towards something dreadful, to the depths of an abyss
mademoiselle,  went on the caressing voice of the attorney in ecclesiastical courts, for the third time, do you persist in denying the facts of which you are accused?
it’s tough and stubborn!
hanged by the crowd for waiting, hanged by the cardinal for not waiting, all he could see on either side of him was an abyss that is a gallows
so the elders decided that he would go from his prison to the square of khamon, with no escort, arms tied behind his back; and it was forbidden to strike him in the heart, so that he should live longer, to put out his eyes, so that he could see his torture to the end, to throw anything at him or strike him with more than three fingers at a time
the boy had to be dragged along, non passibus aequis [not with even steps], as virgil puts it, and kept stumbling, to his mother’s loud protests
let me tell you then—but there’s no need to stop while i tell you the tale—that paquette la chantefleurie was a pretty girl of number when i was the same age, that is eighteen years ago, and it’s her own fault if she’s not like me today, a good, healthy mother of number, with a man and a boy
enter fancy and caprice
he broke off: oh yes!
are you having us on?
the great ditch became full to overflowing; as the living trod on them, the wounded became piled up in confusion with the dead and dying
she seized his bald head in both hands by his remaining hair, and strove to ward off his kisses as if they had been bites
the girl could find only one word: oh, my phoebus!
you are someone who looks like a kind lord!
but their trials, recalled through a drunken haze, seemed to them prodigious and ill-rewarded
some cried to him: come back!
applause and laughter broke out
gladly, but i don’t have any money
that voice, although full of menace, recalled to him another voice which had that morning struck the first blow at his mystery play with its nasal whine in the midst of the audience: charity, please!
that’s a fearfully short skirt,  added la gaillefontaine
i was pure, my soul was filled with limpid brightness
you can see, eye of baal,  the servant said trembling, they have not yet taken everything!
a vast silence filled megara
autharitus, guessing at his words from his expression, applauded him
some statistician or other has calculated that if all the volumes printed since gutenberg were piled one on top of another they would reach as far as the distance from the earth to the moon, but that is not the sort of grandeur we want to talk about
the very humblest stops up a hole or lays a stone
it was quite certainly at the hôtel de ville,  oudarde retorted tartly, because doctor scourable gave them a latin oration which pleased them greatly
it was like a pack of elegant greyhounds circling, with flaring nostrils and blazing eyes, round some poor woodland doe which their master’s eye forbids them to devour
three hours later they came to a second plateau, ringed by a circle of green hills
blast it if i understand you!
gringoire had to be content with this word of praise, for thunderous applause, accompanied by a tremendous burst of cheering, cut short their conversation
olivier made a thumbmark at the article on the rogue and vagabond’ and proceeded
do you want her to die then, she through whom you are alive?
however his skinny ribs rose and fell, and his eyes, wide open in the middle of his dead-white face, stared continuously and unbearably
it has, to be sure, lost more in beauty than it has gained in size
last appeared the structures of the tall machines: carrobalistae, onagers, catapults, and scorpions, swaying about on wagons drawn by mules and ox-teams – and as the army deployed, the captains ran panting from right and left to pass on orders, close up ranks and keep intervals
at number i tried to find a trade
asked guillemette la mairesse
she said almost unconscious
the others did not answer – or, losing their temper, picked up a stone and threw it in their face
he continued on his way down
and you will see them again
jehan remained dignified and impassive
carthage is ours; let’s throw ourselves upon it!
i reckon that no charitable person wanted anything to do with him
next they came to a field of beans; and the whole lot disappeared as though a cloud of locusts had passed by
several turned rapidly round and round, like panthers wounded in the forehead
i have no idea
however he was hard on her, and did not spare penances and bitter words
come to the palace of the tournelles tomorrow and ask for the abbot of saint-martin of tours
what little could be glimpsed of human shape beneath that envelope of mourning made one shudder
that’s a long time yet!
it was indeed the archdeacon
it was none other
he went on, walking, running, taking any street at random, making no choice, simply driven on all the time by the grève, by the horrible grève, which he vaguely felt lay behind him
he had been standing there for a few minutes, thinking or unthinking, leaning in silence against the carved mantelpiece, when fleur-de-lys, suddenly turning round, spoke to him
he was not listening to her: oh!
by their fall they signified stars, sky, fire; by their colour, darkness and night; by their density, the cohesion of earthly things
and you want nothing to do with a man damned!
but the purple curtains were lifted: and on a wide pillow was revealed a puffy, expressionless human head; the eyebrows resembled two ebony bows, meeting at their tips; gold sequins sparkled in the crinkly hair, and the face was so pallid that it looked as though it had been sprinkled with powdered marble
in what fatal order had he ranged in his mind la esmeralda, phoebus, jacques charmolue, his beloved young brother, whom he had abandoned in the mire, his archdeacon’s cassock, perhaps his reputation, dragged along to la falourdel’s, all these images, all these adventures?
a glass mask, which jehan noticed among the alchemical utensils, and which served no doubt to protect the archdeacon’s face while he was concocting some fearsome substance, lay in a corner, covered in dust, as though forgotten
gringoire kept on, and had soon caught up with the most sluggish of these larva-like shapes, which trailed behind the others
he had been captured, and had escaped; recaptured, he had worked in quarries, gasped in the bath-houses, cried out under punishments, belonged to numerous masters, suffered every rage
listen, friend, you talk too much
the man did not say a word
dante could find no better scheme for his inferno
i was told she had taken refuge in notre-dame, and that she was safe there, and i’m delighted, and i haven’t been able to discover whether the goat got away with her, and that’s all i know about it
he covered her with slavering kisses
gringoire slashed at the table with his knife, the girl smiled and seemed to be looking at something through the wall
i have no heart left
there are soldiers everywhere
then they turned again on the captives
blood on these cobbles!
the good lord knows!
the crowd was so great that their departure was not noticed
he got work going on the ramparts, and had the old, now useless, inner walls demolished to furnish stone
their excesses became confused with his daughter’s shame, and he was angry with the whole household for knowing about it and not telling him
mâtho put his hand on it; then he stuck his head through the opening, wrapped his body in it, spread out his arms to see it better
he stopped, out of breath, then went on, beside himself: all i see around me are people getting fat from my leanness!
if it is winter, he is there, crawling on the carpet, clambering laboriously on to a stool, and his mother is fearful in case he goes too near the fire
anyhow, what’s that got to do with your gypsy?
one last despatch made louis xi frown: what’s this?
i don’t want the rich eating me up
she went back into the crowd
soft and swift footsteps could be heard; and from the direction of the portcullis and of the gorge pointed muzzles and erect ears appeared; wild eyes shone
well then, what’s his tongue for, this polyphemus?
what does it matter!
he seemed to be about number years old, and spoke in what was no human language; the words were just not possible
however, for following passers-by (especially female ones) through the streets, something gringoire enjoyed doing, there is no better frame of mind
now he had stirred up a band of students, who had made a classic assault on a tavern, quasi classico excitati [as if roused by the trumpet call], had then beaten the innkeeper with offensive sticks’, and joyfully plundered the tavern, even staving in the hogsheads of wine in the cellar
my friend,  said tristan l’hermite, i presume that’s the witch we’ve been looking for
there too someone was awake
a word, my lovely child!
then he went up again
look out, robert poussepain!
in any case a man who knew the way would accompany her
his sight’s no better than his hearing
you must know, then, that my name is pierre gringoire, and i’m the son of the tax-farmer for the gonesse district
said the archdeacon, an alchemist’s crucible
its open wings extended over the wall, its elongated hands came down to the ground; three black stones, rimmed with a yellow circle, represented three eyes in its brow, and its bull’s head was raised in a terrible effort, as if to bellow
quasimodo let them robe him without a flicker of protest and with a kind of proud docility
coictier tried hard to give a mocking laugh, shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly, and repeated in an undertone: a madman!
as long as the demon sent to attack me only the vague shadows of women passing occasionally before my eyes in church, in the street, in the fields, and rarely returning in my dreams, i easily overcame him
and then i plunge back into the battle!
they killed all the dogs, all the mules, all the donkeys, then the fifteen elephants brought back by the suffete
for quarter of an hour i’ve been waiting for the first blow, nothing happens
both wore long, slate-grey gowns, trimmed with grey squirrel fur, belted and fastened, with caps of the same material and colour
then terror came upon carthage
first there was an excellent salary, to which were attached, hanging like extra bunches on his vine, the revenue from the civil and criminal registries of the provostry, plus the revenues, civil and criminal, from the lower courts of the châtelet, not to mention some small tolls from the bridges of mantes and corbeil, profits from the duty on blacksmiths’ iron in paris, and from the assizers of firewood and inspectors of salt
the unhappy woman had flung herself upon this shoe, her consolation and despair for so many years, and her heart was racked with sobs as on the first day
mahiette shook her head thoughtfully
the gypsy’s arrival abruptly upset that balance
she trembled in every limb, her voice shook, her eyes shone, she had risen to her knees
cried the children; the ironmonger’s ghost!
that is being two and yet only one
shall i, wretch that i am, never see daylight again?
a furnace was set into the thickness of the wall
coppenole added, that reminds me of when the lord of hymbercourt’s house was burned down
you gypsy mother, you’ve eaten my child!
why are you talking of rewards for these men?
i shall do it only this once
the cardinal burst out laughing
he moreover enjoyed the friendship of messire tristan l’hermite, provost-marshal of the king’s household
what’s the meaning of this, sir?
this chant, which some old men lost in the distant darkness were chanting over this beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm air of springtime, bathed in sunshine, was the mass for the dead
a running stream of words!—what’s your plan?
you will recall the loving curiosity with which your mind and eyes fastened on that little whirlwind, humming and whirring on its purple and azure wings, in the midst of which floated an elusive shape, veiled by the very speed of its movement
he experienced the kind of shame which our la fontaine has so admirably defined: ashamed as a fox caught by a hen’
she walked on though, and then she stopped
he sent him fat goats, gold dust, and ostrich plumes
here and there, to be sure, were some inscriptions on the walls, but they were simply scientific or pious maxims taken from reliable authors
when gringoire finally stopped, quite out of breath, he looked up trembling at the king, who was scratching with his nail a patch on the knee of his hose
then he laughed, and his laugh was the most heartrending sound imaginable
here you have the brick houses with stone quoins of henri iv: the place royale, the place dauphine
that was her little foot
they went into caves to catch hyenas alive, then amused themselves in the evening by racing them along the sands of megara, between the steles of the tombs
i deny the physician
she must have swum across,  replied the recluse, defending her ground inch by inch
the fifty tollenones, overlooking the battlements, thus surrounded carthage like monstrous vultures; and the negroes laughed to see the guards on the rampart dying in appalling convulsions
here phoebus, not gifted with a specially creative imagination, began to wonder how on earth to extricate himself from his supposed feat of arms
do you have a heart?
my charmer, the moon shines bright, just look through the vent up there at the wind ruffling the clouds
we don’t hear his laugh any more
in the whole town she believed herself to be disliked by only two persons, about whom she often talked with dread: the sachette of the tour-roland, a nasty old recluse who bore some unknown grudge against gypsy women, and cursed the poor dancer whenever she went by her window; and a priest who never encountered her without looking and speaking to her in a way that frightened her
salammbo was then descending the galley staircase
he drew his sword, then stammering, for anger makes one tremble as much as fear: here!
i don’t know hebrew
in her nostrils she wore a coral button, and she stood beside the bed, straighter than a statue of hermes, with her eyes lowered
and if you have a troubled conscience, curses on your heads!
he had told her the secret of the origins in order to distract her by loftier perspectives; but the virgin’s desire was rekindled by these last words, and schahabarim, half yielding, went on:
the tablets had been sent by greek soldiers from sardinia
the palsied were brought along on litters; many had the foresight to bring food with them and stayed until evening; others spent the night there
it was all treble rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, tenor rebecs, not to mention flutes and brass
they are running up!
she cried; and salammbo escaped out of sight
a massive fire burned within it, the reflection of its red glare filling the cellar and depriving a wretched candle standing in a corner of any radiance
there is in them a human quality which they constantly blend with the divine symbol under which they are still produced
finally they came beneath the walls of carthage to implore the protection of ceres and proserpine, for in byrsa there was a temple and priests dedicated to these goddesses, in expiation of the past atrocities committed at the siege of syracuse
the recluse breathed again
she saw his frightful look and tried to flee
a single pointed window, tightly set into the thick wall, let a wan beam of january daylight fall on two grotesque figures, the fanciful stone devil carved as a cul-de-lampe on the keystone of the vault, and the judge sitting at the far end of the room upon the fleurs-de-lys
his companion had disappeared during the struggle
i have studied hermetics,  exclaimed coictier, and i maintain …’
the hands and heads of the people in this crowd, standing out dark against the luminous background, were silhouetted in one weird gesture after another
your stool limps as badly as one of martial’s distichs: one foot is a hexameter, the other a pentameter
so,  claude put in, his brow steadily clearing, it’s your belief, maître pierre, that this creature has never been approached by a man?
however, it was apparent from the first glance that these three fragments of city formed a single body
then great tears fell from her eyes one by one, and ran down her furrowed cheeks like a torrent in the bed it has scoured out
the carthaginians felt their strength increased, and battle began again
when their despondency had quietened down a little they examined what provisions they had
he began to walk
didn’t even see that our privileges were respected on a day like this!
his heart burst out in furious words
, different in each language, was understood by all
the human body, darkness; the stars, darkness!
besides, to be fair to him, his viciousness was perhaps not innate
in tragedy it’s what we call a monologue
i would like to beat her!
she did not dare to look at him and just lay inert
with some difficulty dom claude managed to hear what they were saying through the pounding of the blood in his temples
the power of the archdeacon over the bell-ringer, the bell-ringer’s attachment to the archdeacon defy comparison
then he began to harry them
clopin trouillefou, dressed up in his royal insignia, was no more and no less ragged; the sore on his arm had already disappeared
monseigneur le cardinal,  coppenole said without loosing coppenole’s hand, he’s a friend of mine
never,  adds an eye-witness of number, have the sudden metamorphoses of the court of miracles been more felicitously depicted
that man you call the duke of egypt, is he the chief of your tribe?
he was on the ground, kneeling in front of her; he put his arms around her waist, his head thrown back, his hands roving over her; the gold discs hanging from his ears shone against his bronzed neck; great tears welled up in his eyes like silver globes; he sighed endearments, and murmured vague words, lighter than a breeze and soft as a kiss
musnier, we’ll thrash your lackey
he was seized by the waist, lifted up and drawn away outside the rampart, to a spot where the terrace was high
he made as if to lunge at the captain
he watched her attentively while she was speaking
he had been able to judge how impregnable was the modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy, and he had worked out mathematically to the power of two the resistance of that chastity
he began to heap insults on them
the town penetrated even further into the countryside than the university
but his words revealed just as much agitation
who do you take me for, friend?
i take an interest in you and wish you well
hanno denounced the unworthiness of such an insult; he had caught the disease as a result of a chill at the siege of hecatompylus, and tears ran down his face like winter rain on a ruined wall
meanwhile the dismal cavalcade had passed through the crowd amid cries of joy and people straining to see
he used it to enter the church
with her teeth she held up the hem of her robe which hampered her, and in three leaps she found herself on the platform
they did not stop any more
monsieur the high provost, i’d rather have a hole in my insides than see a scratch on her finger
curses on you who robbed tanit!
for my part, i used to think that truth was dead, and had not found a confessor
this was, to be sure, one of the most irksome smiles he had ever had to assume for the sake of the king’s good pleasure
no, my lord, that’s where i stop understanding
sweat off your gold and your pox!
that immense body is empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has left it
the barbarians looked at each other in silence
they slumped down, feeling an icy chill in their backs, and overwhelming heaviness in their eyes
claude carried little jehan to her himself
i’m cold, i’m afraid, and there are creatures that climb over my body
so she took her to the gypsies; and the gypsy women were all over the child, admiring her, fondling her, kissing her with their black mouths, and marvelling over her little hand
i cannot read, only spell out the letters
now and then i still compose epics and tragedies, but what brings me in most is that industry you have seen me at, master—carrying pyramids of chairs in my teeth
the whistle made a clear, shrill, piercing sound
the archdeacon began examining the vessel
one condition,  the man said
anyone who could have seen the captain’s face blaze at that moment, the way he sprang backwards, so violently that he broke loose from the pincer grip that had seized him, the haughty expression with which his hand flew to his sword hilt, and faced so angrily the bleak immobility of the man in the cloak, anyone who had seen that would have been terrified
the exhausted mercenaries could not stand against his troops
it was to see a negro rolling on the ground, thrashing about, with staring eyes, twisted neck, foaming at the mouth
it’s as good a show as any
at last three samnite shepherds discovered him fifteen paces from the recent site of mâtho’s tent
then came a prodigious yell, in which every language, every dialect, every accent mingled
several men fell to their knees; the others, continuing, walked over them
as he looked at the prisoners he revelled in imagining their punishment
she has indeed taken refuge in notre-dame
a great clamour rose up in the mappalia
we’ll go from bishop guillaume’s doorway and saint-jean-le-rond to the sainte-chapelle, then to nicolas flamel’s house, in the rue marivault, to his tomb, in the holy innocents’ cemetery, to his two hospitals in the rue de montmorency
three, however, emerged from the crowd and came to sniff at him
these wretches were scarcely recognizable, with their faces hidden beneath vermin and filth
the idea of committing sacrilege revived the mercenaries’ greed; they quickly set fires under bronze pots and enjoyed watching the fine fish struggling in the boiling water
cerberus would not nibble at the honey cake
then he gently patted the thick wall of the keep, like someone stroking a charger’s crupper
she has probably forgotten me, and i don’t even know her name
then silence fell on everything, some remaining perched on the pediment of buildings, shading their eyes with their hand, while others lying flat at the foot of the ramparts listened intently
suddenly he dropped the wooden leaves and flung himself down full length, with arms outstretched, in the position of a condemned man
no roof of iron crosses, no octagonal lantern, no slender columns rising to spread out on the edge of the roof into capitals of acanthus and flowers, no chimerical and monstrous waterspouts, no carved timbers, no delicate sculpture deeply cut into the stone
my father charles vii used to say that truth was ailing
from the first step he took she had stood up; then, involuntarily, as he drew nearer, she had gradually come further forward to the edge of the terrace; and soon all the outside world was blotted out and she saw only mâtho
no words can describe the amazement mixed with fright which fell with this beam upon the bandits
the cool breeze blowing downstream stirred the leaves of the single tree planted at the tip of the terrain quite audibly
perhaps he had stayed behind?
i will buy my freedom!
but now salammbo felt no fear of him
he said to the poor sleeping clerk, and went off
the beggar accepted the alms and the gibe without flinching, and went on crying mournfully: charity, please!
he had just bought this cloak from the secondhand-clothes dealer near the pomme d’ève, no doubt as protection against the cold march evenings, perhaps to conceal his dress
her body bounced with every jolt of the tumbril like a thing dead or broken
then from that eye, which up to then had been so dry and burnt up, a big tear could be seen slowly rolling down that misshapen face, so long distorted by despair
some tore off their amulets and spat on them
that head was very deformed
sire,  the provost of paris answered, i suppose that as the people have come to snatch her out of her asylum in notre-dame, they are offended by her impunity and want to hang her
jehan observed with a sigh that there was no saucepan
but someone, under the trees, was running behind them; and mâtho, who was carrying the veil, several times felt it being pulled very gently from below
twenty good lancers could easily have stopped them with a frontal attack on their column; the carthaginians watched them pass by in utter amazement
she imagines she can see him, she does see him, all of him, living, joyful, with his delicate hands, round head, pure lips, untroubled eyes with the whites still tinged with blue
the story of a maize cake
we’ve got his palliasse, we’re going to make a bonfire with it!
my father’s a bird—my mother’s another,
it had not yet then been obstructed by the tall forest of chicanery and legal procedure which these two jurisconsults planted there at the beginning of the sixteenth century
where could it be then?
she struggled in his arms
finally mâtho murmured: beaten!
everyone tried to turn round and face the place
she would caress her, kiss her, tickle her, dress her up, almost eat her!
great flashes of lightning came from time to time; then it became darker than ever; and all she could see were mâtho’s eyes, like two embers in the night
with the power of punic money behind him, the adventurer had caused the numidian states to revolt by promising them their freedom
[against goads, red-hot irons, crosses and shackles, fetters, chains, prisons, hobbles, foot-chains, iron collars]
at length he fell down a second time, exhausted; he dragged himself out of the cell on his knees, and crouched down facing the door in an attitude of astonishment
thief from egypt, you will be going up there again!
what do you need then to break it down?
you are off to look for lodgings in the rue thibautodé, aren’t you, monsieur le recteur, the man who gambles with the devil?
spendius had been right in foreseeing it
finally he stopped with a look of despair
suddenly a puff of wind blew his lamp out, and at almost the same time he saw appearing, at the opposite corner of the tower, a shadow, a patch of white, a shape, a woman
the routes he took remained always unknown
in fact,  of the soundest, etruscan, libyan, and spartan mercenaries, had gone to the heights from the beginning, and had so far stayed there unsure what to do
she made one last effort and began to cry: help!
as he thus delved into his soul, when he saw what spacious provision nature had made in it for passions, he laughed all the more bitterly
that’s a bit much
a novice’s habit from the hôtel-dieu
he said hastily: oh!
serpents had feet, bulls wings, man-headed fish were eating fruit, flowers were blooming in crocodiles’ jaws, and elephants with raised trunks passed proud as eagles through blue sky
former caravan leaders tied ropes tightly round their bellies
some insisted on following the armies
she said, flushed and anxious, i do feel warm!
but such is the king’s good pleasure
indeed, when after groping one’s way up the long, dark spiral staircase, pierced vertically through the thickness of the tower walls, one at last emerged on to one of the two lofty platforms, flooded with light and air, it was a fine picture that on every side at once unfolded before the eye; a sight sui generis, which can be readily visualized by those of our readers who have been lucky enough to see a gothic town intact, complete, homogeneous, such as the few still remaining, nuremberg in bavaria, vittoria in spain, or even smaller specimens, so long as they are well preserved, vitré in brittany, nordhausen in prussia
as the work of demolition seemed to be making progress, the mother automatically moved back, pressing the girl more and more tightly against the wall
these preparations annoyed the barbarians
are you crazy, jehan?
without realizing what he was asking for, she was seized with horror
he came to spendius and said:
by the pope’s bowels!
at that moment the cell rang with the clanking of weapons and the noise of galloping horses which seemed to emerge from the pont notre-dame and to be approaching nearer and nearer along the quay
this pile of ordinary dwellings, packed together like cells in a beehive, had a beauty of its own
many women had come there to weep, until they died, for parents, lovers, sins
then he said: i frighten you
louis’s face became sombre and thoughtful
the king looked straight at him: i said tomorrow morning
not that pierre gringoire felt any fear, or contempt, for the cardinal
windows are your eyes
for less than a week ago we had the miracle of divine punishment being visited by our lady of aubervillers on the man who scoffed at pilgrims, and that was the second miracle this month
the halberds of the colourfully dressed beadles rang on the floor, and a few moments later a long procession of priests in chasubles and deacons in dalmatics, chanting as they advanced gravely towards the condemned girl, came within her sight and the eyes of the crowd
he made great efforts to convince himself that he was mistaken, that there was only one cross, and even to believe that there were none at all
suddenly a light shone out, and in an instant seven or eight lighted torches cast their light over the heads, their tufts of flame flickering in the shadows
he had the trumpets sounded
oh, tower of babel!
it was quasimodo’s whistle
the four characters of the prologue were bemoaning their insoluble predicament, when venus in person, vera incessu patuit dea [a true goddess was evident in her step] appeared before them, wearing a fine cotehardie emblazoned with the ship of the town arms of paris
so nothing shows outwardly of the fire burning my heart!
when he was outside, he took the great zaïmph from around his neck, and raised it as high as he could above his head
from then on he did not stir
her thoughts were locked up in it, never to leave it until her death
all that didn’t stop me growing up tall and thin, as you can see
the king did not notice
the goat looked at him shrewdly, lifted a gilded hoof and knocked seven times
said the suffete scornfully
as the priests hurried, so the people’s frenzy increased; as the number of victims diminished, some cried out that they should be spared, others that more still were needed
these were the flames that had been gleaming from afar on the lake
to please him she has put on the goddess’s robe; and as she yields her body, she delivers up the glory of your name, the majesty of the gods, the country’s vengeance, the very salvation of carthage!
with one bound she leaped to the far end of the cell, stooped, and straightened up again with a small dagger in her hand before gringoire even had time to see where the dagger had come from; angry and proud, her lips puffed out, nostrils flaring, cheeks apple-red, eyes flashing lightning
porters slept in the streets up against the entrance to the houses; the shadow of the colossi grew longer over the deserted squares; far off the smoke from a still-burning sacrifice escaped through the bronze tiles, and the heavy breeze carried with the scent of spices the tang of the sea and the odour of walls heated by the sun
you will be repaid in heaven
de venire inferi clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam, et projecisti me in profundum in corde maris, et flumen circumdedit me
i discover countless things in those stars sprinkled over the black fireback
private debts were considered as public debts, men of canaanite race had the monopoly of trade; by multiplying the profits of piracy with those of usury, by crude exploitation of the land, the slaves and the poor, some people achieved wealth
this isn’t what they told me
but at the top they found a second wall, composed of stones and long beams lying flat, alternating like the pieces of a chessboard
after that he opened his jaws wide, and for a few moments let out a long roar, reflected by echoes from the mountain, which finally died away in the solitude
but she mumbled: he’s too skinny,  and went away
but he’s a devil of a man
did you throw many double sixes last night?
how lucky you are to have someone who loves you!
now, hanging men of letters is a poor way of being a patron of letters
each hole contained a round, dark stone that looked very heavy
the university looked like one single block
he was jealous of this carthage that contained salammbo, as he would have been of someone who possessed her
that was a near thing!
the poet went on fondly
the two natural exits from this impasse were closed by the portcullis and by the heap of rocks
it had no depth which quasimodo had not penetrated, no height he had not scaled
you can see how i have gnawed at my arms, lord!
at last the gypsy said to him: that does not fill me with as much loathing as you do
he quickened his step
but of darkness, of flames, and not of light
we’ll never get in through the door
give your nonsense a rest!
do you see that row of idiotic-looking statues there above the three doorways?
one evening i had my spinning-wheel going, there’s a bang at my door
examples proved that this method compelled the scourge to disappear
there’s a staircase for you!
at night he often left carthage, alone, and pressed on beyond the lagoon, towards the mouths of the macar
it seemed to her that the sort of veil which had shrouded her memory was being rent asunder
besides, sire, i am a man of letters
jacques charmolue brought him fully back to reality by asking him: well then, master, when are you coming to help me make gold?
sparks flew, spurted out; they were walking through fire
suddenly his majesty turned to the governor of the bastille
it was hardly worth sending you to the slave school at syracuse
gringoire scratched his ear with a very serious look
suddenly, as he swept the great city with that one eye which, by way of compensation, nature had made so piercing that it could almost make up for the other organs which quasimodo lacked, it seemed to him that there was something odd about the outline of the quai de la vieille pelleterie, that something was moving at that point, that the line of the parapet, standing out black against the whiteness of the water, was not straight and still like that of the other quays, but rippling as he watched like waves on a river or the heads of a marching crowd
if your church is sacred, so is our sister; if our sister is not sacred, neither is your church
behind extended the city, its tall, cube-shaped houses rising in tiers like an amphitheatre
but a fatality dogged the poor foundling
thus in the town you could go in a straight line from the porte saint-antoine to the porte saint-honoré; in the university from the porte saint-victor to the porte saint-germain
i’ve just come from there
they continued, and went on to the end
the argoteers made him stand on the stool
almost everything has disappeared
the moment was brief
which has constantly superimposed itself, without a break or a lapse, on advancing mankind, that monster of a thousand feet?
they go for each other with their tongues, and that’s all
but how did the carthaginians beat you?
two days later the mercenaries left carthage
all the ash i could wish
and at the same time, with her free hand, she swiftly opened the little bag decorated with green glass beads which she wore round her neck
thus numb, chilled, petrified, she had hardly noticed on two or three occasions the sound of a trapdoor opening somewhere above her, without letting in even a chink of light, and through it a hand throwing her a crust of black bread
in a suburb there were almost as many places of asylum as of execution
the archdeacon and the bell-ringer, as we have already said, were not greatly liked by the people, high or low, who lived near the cathedral
write down the names of the ones who seem to be the bravest, and try to find out if they are loyal to the republic!
a great tumult arose, shaking the staircases, and a mass of people: women, servants, slaves, rushed into the room with spears, clubs, cutlasses, daggers
he said, this will kill that
he added, looking around him at the place de grève: it’s a name with echoes around here
right away,  said oudarde
so they resolved, in order to weaken barca, to give a share in delivering the republic to the one they favoured, old hanno
it was all shouting and bawling
the man stopped, turned to her and raised his hood
finally, in the intervals between these roofs, these spires, these uneven contours of the innumerable buildings which bent, twisted, and indented so oddly the outer line of the university, one caught a glimpse here and there of some great section of wall, overgrown with moss, a thick round tower, a crenellated city-gate, representing the fortress; this was philip-augustus’s enclosure
on its base some ancient titles of humanity, unrecorded by architecture, have been rewritten
there was no fighting that day, everyone was too exhausted
only at intervals some ragged urchin would stretch up on tiptoe to reach the window sill and shout into the tavern the mocking old cry with which drunkards were then harried: aux houls, drunk, drunk, drunk!
besides, they had no idea how to drill and in his discouragement autharitus did not ask anything more of them
the groves of the king’s garden, which covered the western tip of the city, concealed the cowferryman’s islet
the poor woman felt her assurance slipping away more and more
our readers have certainly not waited until now to recognize in maître olivier’ that terrible figaro whom providence, that great dramatist, involved so artistically in the long bloody play of louis xi
what have you to say in your defence?
the sides to the north and east, defended by the sea and the gulf, remained inaccessible
above the flame, the enormous towers, each showing two sharply distinct faces, one all black, the other all red, seemed bigger still with the immensity of the shadow they projected right up to the sky
now that spirit seemed to have disappeared; the cathedral seemed dreary and only too glad to be silent
there was one who stood motionless, head bent, not speaking; his great white beard fell down to his fettered hands; and the carthaginians, feeling in their innermost hearts as though the republic had collapsed, recognized gisco
the evening of the same day the whole army departed
he would have liked to envelop her, absorb her, drink her in
replied spendius, the temple is empty
besides, she might perhaps obtain the veil and not perish
for, so that others should have no occasion to laugh at him, from the moment that he realized he was deaf he firmly resolved to keep a silence which he hardly ever broke except when he was alone
recovering from his initial stupefaction, he cried with all his might to the four characters on stage: go on!
the capital is increasing only in houses, and what houses!
elephants are all afraid of the sea!
then they passed under a gallery covered over with foliage
the shepherds could be seen running down from the mountains
to think that her shoe is there and that’s all!
this was to force the souls to return
cowardly blabbermouth, with a slipper for a helmet!
she will obey you
the goat raised its foreleg and struck the tambourine once
and he angrily threw away the hammer
not for the sake of the house, which is plain and quite unpretentious, but for jehan fourbault’s paintings, which brighten up the wainscotting
women leaned over the battlements screaming
to crush them on the isthmus two armies would simultaneously have had to take them in the rear, one landing at the end of the gulf of utica, the second at the mountain of the hot-springs
some swam across, others used their shields
but their feet slipped; they fell into deep pools
he said, the witch!—monsieur d’estouteville, what were the people wanting to do with her?
dignitas, says joannes loemnoeus, quae non cum exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque praerogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est [a dignity which is accompanied by no small power of police, and many prerogatives and rights]
coictier exclaimed: by heaven, dom claude, alchemy no doubt has its point, but why blaspheme against medicine and astrology?
the moment was critical
the rich lined up along the mappalia as soon as the cock crowed; and hitching up their robes practised pike drill
the rugged cathedral was his carapace
they were used to murderous effect; ethiopian archers went into the baskets; then, with the cables under control, they stayed suspended in the air shooting poisoned arrows
by the time pierre gringoire reached the place de grève he was numb with cold
talking of which, mademoiselle, that is where i should have begun
we should be bathed in perfumes; i should have slaves in my turn!
salammbo had left the sacred rhythm
mentally he summoned salammbo to a meeting; then waited for her
when rats eat cats
i think she’s gone to dance some fandango in that house opposite, where they called her in
the priest asked after a silence
let us return to paris and the fifteenth century
he suddenly noticed the long chain which was pulled to operate the gate’s drawbridge
captain, it’s not the joist that’s bothering us, it’s the door, laced all over with iron bars
the barbarian was wrong; hanno was in one of those extremities when all considerations are lost, and besides he so detested hamilcar that on the least hope of salvation he would have sacrificed him and all his soldiers
i felt the draught from it, tête-bœuf!
phoebus planted a mighty kick in his chest with his boot
and no means of saving themselves, no hope!
in any case, these buildings which mark the transition from romanesque to gothic repay study no less than the pure types
one evening, at supper-time, a cracked and heavy sound could be heard coming closer, and far away something red appeared in the rolling landscape
then he put his foot on the ladder to go up
when one councillor remarked that they were all tired and it would be a long time to wait until the torture was finished, the president replied that a magistrate must be ready to sacrifice himself to his duty
before sunset he withdrew
i need money to go and see isabeau la thierrye this evening at the val d’amour
i can’t tell you
in the middle ages, once a building was completed there was almost as much of it in the ground as outside
the cat-faced old woman came up from the trapdoor first, then phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, the beautiful and graceful figure of la esmeralda
a priest and a philosopher are two different things
aren’t you tired of sleeping on the hard ground, drinking the vinegar they serve in camp, always hearing the trumpet call?
for feeding a rogue and vagabond shut up for the past six months in the cell at the flayers’ yard, while waiting to learn what to do with him—number livres number sols
and what is this talk, then, of husband and wife?
she cried, how can i…?
she did not answer
lord god, i am only a vile sinner; but my daughter made me pious
salammbo followed him through the entire camp
phoebus was delighted that the first question helped him evade the second
you want to die?
i promise you one
they would meet next day at sunrise, on the plain of rhades
wipe away, i beseech you, the great drops of sweat streaming from my brow!
mâtho seemed insensible; suddenly he gathered his forces, and began to run at random, his lips making the sort of noise people make when shivering with intense cold
anyhow, what am i?
all the stewards followed him
the town of cambrai,
he belonged to one of those families of middle rank which, in the impertinent language of the last century, were called indifferently upper bourgeoisie or minor nobility
it was getting rusty,  he said as he gave it back to her
suddenly exclaimed jacques coictier, what has become of that stabbing pain for which your majesty had me summoned?
his position was indeed becoming less and less tenable
right at the back, in the shadows of the apse, a gigantic silver cross could just be made out, spread out over a black drape hanging from the vaulting to the pavement
they were taking their revenge for the constraint to which the political ceremonial had just obliged them; and though they had wanted hamilcar to return, they were angry now that he had not prevented their disasters, or rather had not endured them as they had
and the money it cost!
the unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp
then he put the boy on a stool, by the gold shields
meanwhile the square sparkled with a thousand torches
at least it wouldn’t be as dull as listening to those windbags
one of the sergeants of the wand had to draw maître charmolue’s attention to this, for, throughout this scene, he had been busy studying the bas-relief of the main doorway which represents, according to some, abraham’s sacrifice, according to others the alchemists’ process, portraying the sun by the angel, the fire by the faggots, the operator by abraham
it is certain that the archdeacon often visited the cemetery of the holy innocents, where his father and mother had been buried, it is true, with the other victims of the plague of number; but he seemed to pay much less devotion to the cross on their grave than to the strange figures set upon the tomb of nicolas flamel and claude pernelle, erected beside it
she cried, still from the same dark corner of the square
first, turning a blind eye to their revolt, he wanted to detach all the tribes from the barbarians’ cause; then, when they were isolated in the midst of the provinces, he would fall on them and wipe them out
behind every bush they met sentries in ambush
i was passing by there this evening
i swear by the holy angels in paradise
he’s a monstrous prince
these words were, so to speak, the point of intersection of two scenes which had up to then developed in parallel, simultaneously, each on its own stage; the one, which you have just read, at the rat-hole, the other, which you are about to read, on the ladder of the pillory
there thus filed by in column of four, wearing the different insignia of their degrees in this strange faculty, most of them disabled in some way, some limping, some with only one arm, the courtauds de boutanche, coquillarts, hubins, sabouleux, calots, francsmitoux, polissons, piètres, capons, malingreux, rifodés, marcandiers, narquois, orphans, archisuppôts, cagoux, an enumeration to make homer weary
i love you—that little mark on your neck, do you still have it?
it had been a long time since he had last seen the archdeacon, and dom claude was one of those solemn, passionate men an encounter with whom always upsets the balance of a sceptical philosopher
the squad of sergeants surrounding him was attended by the captain of the watch in person, bearing the arms of france embroidered on his chest and those of the town on his back
the captain’s one thing, but him!
exquisite scents were evaporating
as a reward he promised new-carthaginians full citizenship
the carthaginians had not yet returned to their homes when the clouds piled up ever more densely; those who were looking up at the colossus felt large drops on their foreheads, and the rain came down
that’s a pity,  gisquette replied
his nights were awful
you’ll see her hang
to prove the point, it is crowned by an attic storey such as was never seen in athens, a fine straight line, gracefully broken here and there by stove pipes
louis xi gave him a penetrating look
quasimodo made no reply
in the midst of the punic syntagmata the voice of the crier announcing the orders could no longer be heard; the standards above the dust repeated their signals, and each one went on, carried away in the tide of the great mass surrounding him
come along then,  the shadow went on
the clibanarii, whose horses were exhausted, did not try to catch them up
so that the people do not say: where are their gods now?
eye of baal, may your house flourish!
so he climbed up inside the north tower, while down below the beadle was opening wide the church doors, which at that time were huge panels of stout wood covered in leather, bordered with gilded studs and set in a framework of most skilfully worked’ sculptures
you’ll see how i love you too
but the gate of malqua, the gate of tagaste and the great gate of khamon lay wide open
their heavy cudgels bristled with bronze spikes; cutlasses flashed against their revoltingly dirty clothes, and they opened their eyes wide in a menacing and surprised look
it was in just such a sump, in the oubliettes excavated by st louis, in the in pace of the tournelle, that they had, doubtless for fear of an escape, deposited la esmeralda, condemned to the gallows, with the colossal palais de justice over her head
from the student, who had begun to be seriously afraid that his knee was going to take on the imprint of his chin
shining and round you skim the mountain tops like a chariot wheel
nothing will unite us, not even hell!
i don’t want that girl accosting me in the street
show me your rat-hole, then, so i can give her her cake
they were agnès la herme, jehanne de la tarme, henriette la gaultière, gauchère la violette, all four of them widows, all four bonnes-femmes or religious from the chapel of étienne haudry, who had left their house with their superior’s permission, and in accordance with pierre d’ailly’s statutes, to come and hear the sermon
however, inexperienced and diffident to start with, it opened, broadened out, contained itself, and did not dare soar up into spires and lancets as it did later in so many marvellous cathedrals
the sergeants of the watch cleared a way for it through the crowd with great sweeps of their boullayes
when he could not ravage the fields, he threw stones into them to make them barren
am i a poor man then?
cried in a voice of thunder a horseman who suddenly emerged from a crossroads nearby
this great bell was called marie
some even thought they could recognize hair, limbs, whole bodies
do you see, compère guillaume?
he was sorry, he said, to have none of his own blood to offer: and he stared at hamilcar, facing him at the other end of the room
so far no one knew her
i feel that what i am doing is wrong
he sped off over the steps
it’s for seven o’clock, as you know
a porter, a pastrycook, a baker, two carters, each at number livres a year!
it was as though she was containing herself for fear of being driven away
said jehan to himself, that’s a long time to wait for a gold écu!
amid all this witches’ sabbath he could still be seen up on his pillar, like a cabin boy in the crow’s nest
when, at a bend in the gallery overlooking the roof of the side-aisles, he saw the narrow cell with its little window and little door, huddled under a huge flying buttress like a bird’s nest under a branch, the poor man’s heart failed him, and he leaned against a pillar to stop himself falling
he was the son of a greek orator and a prostitute from campania
monsieur the king’s attorney,  pierrat said brusquely, what shall we start with?
gringoire said to him: master, my answer to you is il padelt, which is turkish for god is our hope!
it fell all night, abundantly, in a deluge; the thunder rumbled; it was the voice of moloch; he had conquered tanit, and now made fertile she was opening her vast womb from the heavenly heights
the total comes to number livres number sols number deniers
he put the basket on the ground and said: eat
all the same, you will be aware that noël lescripvain was fined a week ago number sols parisis for carrying a short sword
the arrival of such help did not please the carthaginians as much as the mere sight of these powerful animals sacred to baal; it was a pledge of his affection, a proof that he was at last going to take a hand in the war for their defence
well then, young gypsy, if neither you nor your goat have any dancing to show us, what are you doing in here?
some of the elders had stationed themselves on the platform of the towers, and no one knew why at intervals there stood a long-bearded figure in an attitude of meditation
first he had instructed the actors, who had remained in suspended animation, to go on, and to speak more loudly
anyone who could have seen her in such a state, after seeing her laughing and singing in the sunlight, would have shuddered
it grieved him deeply
a wretched bycocket, it is true, but still good for a day of sunshine or a day of rain
hamilcar tolerated them, more from foresightedness than contempt
well now,  he said, that’s an idea which would never have occurred to me just like that
she let out a cry of joy: oh!
do not despise me because i am weak!
they shouted out that they were soon going to empty those big bellies, brush the gold dust off their skin, and make them drink iron
no, no,  he said
there was certainly an element of scorn and mockery in the graceful little grimace
we should add that his deafness to some extent made him also dumb
the poor devil said to her in a low voice
like them we shall leave jehan sleeping under the kindly gaze of the stars, and will follow too, if it please the reader
meanwhile the good lady had stood up irritably
she came forward to face the suffete and they looked at each other for a time; suddenly hamilcar started; at a sign of his hand the slaves withdrew
finally the three leaders and the schalischim asked themselves what they now ought to decide
suddenly he stopped, wide-eyed, as if he had discovered his death sentence among the figures
this, thought the priests of moloch, was an outrage he had come to perpetrate against their god; with sweeping gestures they tried to repulse him
hamilcar did not want to be involved again in any government
when chantefleurie learned these horrible details she did not weep, she moved her lips as though to speak, but could not
ah!—there’s a decree of parliament sending you back to the scaffold
oudarde was insistent: no, sister
with that said, like a body returning to its centre of gravity, he became motionless once more
perhaps that will stop the queen coming to paris in september,  put in another
she flies, she’s happy, she’s just been born; she seeks the spring, the open air, freedom; oh!
the man who had acted so rashly was the individual with the bald forehead who, a moment before, blending with the group round the gypsy girl, had chilled the poor girl with his menacing and hateful words
hamilcar had recommended the taking of prisoners
first you will languish, light as a vapour hovering over the water; and after longer trials and suffering you will depart into the centre of the sun, the very source of intelligence!
when you have children, oudarde, you will know that there’s nothing prettier than such tiny hands and feet
he said between his teeth
we shall not attempt to give any idea of her gestures, her tone, the tears she swallowed as she spoke, the way she clasped and then wrung her hands, her heart-rending smiles, her tearful glances, the groans, the sighs, the chilling cries of misery mingled with her muddled, crazy, incoherent words
men in scarlet cloaks removed him from the enclosure; then, once outside, he went round all the colleges in turn, and the priest, henceforth without a god, disappeared into the crowd, which drew away at his approach
thybalde aleatorl [thibaut the gambler] silly old fool!
on his left he had the succentor, on his right the precentor armed with his staff of office
it’s because i think i recognize him
she was more cut off from the world than quasimodo!
monsieur the provost, i’m a soldier and it’s not my business to hang witches
the windows of the gondelaurier mansion, however, stayed lit up, even after midnight
he went right up to the edge, lay on his back, and, feet first, slid all the way down to the bottom; then he swam to the cape of tombs, made a wide detour by the salt lagoon, and by evening had returned to the barbarians’ camp
he’s a sponge for soaking up money laid upon the people
the king replied with a smile of satisfaction that he tried in vain to disguise
then they seated him on a gaudy litter
he returned that same evening
an old bully addressed him
it was one of those spectres, half light, half shade, such as one sees in dreams and in goya’s extraordinary works, pale, motionless, sinister, crouched on a grave or leaning against the bars of a dungeon
what is he called?
pale, fists clenched, he quivered like a harp whose strings are about to snap
yet over it all lay so much sadness and gentleness that she began to get used to it
the barbarians still expected to see mâtho appear – and they were unwilling to leave the mountain from discouragement, weariness, the obstinacy of sick men who refuse to move; finally, when provisions were exhausted, the zuaces went away
he might still land at the cape of grapes, and thence march on one of the towns
such generosity amazed the barbarians; some were terrified, and mâtho was sorry that the spokesman had not been killed
and, going inside the building, who overthrew that colossal saint christopher, proverbial among statues just as the great hall of the palais was among halls, the spire of strasbourg among steeples?
when he came to the porte baudoyer he made straight for the stone cross standing in the middle of the square, as if he had been able to distinguish in the darkness the figure of a man dressed and hooded in black sitting on the steps of the cross
no one had yet noticed in the gallery of the statues of the kings, carved immediately above the arches of the doorway, a strange spectator who had so far been observing everything so impassively, his neck so outstretched, his face so deformed, that but for his costume, half red and half violet, he could have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose jaws the cathedral’s long gutters have been discharging for six hundred years
there are some words on it that we can’t understand
the archdeacon could feel this pipe slowly giving way
then they pushed against the walls drills which would loosen them when applied to the joints between the blocks
from their houses the carthaginians heard the fanfare of the trumpets controlling the exercises
they told us at the châtelet that they were taking him to the pillory straightaway
she writhed, with her lovely body half naked on his knees
devil take the bishop of paris and his water-mills!
but the slope was too steep, and he had no strength left
hurry up there and pull your boy along
he thought of the wretched lot dealt him by providence, how women, love, sensual delight would everlastingly pass before his eyes, how he would only ever see the bliss of others
the bell-ringer retreated a step or two behind the archdeacon, and suddenly, rushing at him furiously, pushed him in the back with both his huge hands, down into the abyss over which dom claude was leaning
she pushed him away and clung to gringoire’s sleeve, while he, in his turn, busy with the goat, almost pushed her away
as long as you are completely cured, my phoebus!
in this way he could see everything that was going on in the next room
i mustn’t stay too long
above our heads a double ogive vault, panelled with wooden carvings, painted sky-blue, sprinkled with golden fleurs-de-lys, beneath our feet a marble pavement with alternate slabs of black and white
phoebus found the moment’ suitable for stealing another kiss, adding to the torment of the wretched archdeacon in his corner
right,  he murmured almost aloud, it is obvious that the king is unwell today
all right, my dear fellow,  rejoined charmolue, leave it open
a long pile of black ashes smoked on the libyans’ site; the earth rippled like the sea where it had been churned up and the tents, with the canvas torn to shreds, looked vaguely like ships half wrecked on reefs
she noticed a path in the thickness of the rampart
i declare this bold metaphor to be admirable, and maintain that natural history in the theatre, on a day of allegory and royal epithalamium, has no cause for offence in a dolphin being son of a lion
they thought that some of their number, remaining behind in the city (for they did not know how many they were) were amusing themselves by pillaging a temple
why, there’s a maypole and a bonfire in the town; a mystery play, pope of fools, and a flemish embassy in the city; and in the university not a thing!
he said rather timidly:
but soon the barbarians set up, opposite, an immense raft to prevent the carthaginians from coming out
or was she speaking of the barbarians?
the priest lifted up his hood
he tore his knees, broke his nails, then fell back into the water and made his way back
he clung to life
a short while ago she had been singing among the tables; she had disappeared, and from that moment he had been continually climbing these stairs
it was, as we have said, the mother’s last rampart
spendius was untiring in directing them
whereupon he hurled his cap at the wall and clicked his fingers like castanets
should he rouse the gypsy?
here alone lies truth’ (as he spoke he had picked up from the chest a phial full of the powder mentioned earlier), here alone is light!
he remembered that dom claude was the only person with a key to the staircase leading to the cell, he recalled his nocturnal attempts on the girl, the first of which quasimodo had assisted, the second prevented
a candelabra carved all over with flowers burned at the back, and each of its golden branches held a byssus wick in a diamond cup
the strange faces which came one after another to grind their teeth at the rose-window were so many brands thrown on the fire
a long shudder ran through her whole body from head to foot, her teeth chattered, she half raised her head, and, pressing her elbows tightly against her hips and taking her feet in her hands as if to warm them, she said: oh!
men wearing ragged cloaks, as a sign of despair, stood at the corners of crossroads
but for its form as a building it would have found itself being publicly burned at the hand of the executioner in the form of manuscript, had it been unwise enough to risk appearing thus
he cast a haggard eye over the tortuous double path which fatality had made their two destinies follow up to their point of intersection, where fatality again had smashed them mercilessly against each other
it was neither woman nor man, nor living creature, nor definite shape; it was a figure; a sort of vision where reality and fantasy intersected like darkness and daylight
well now, upon my soul,  joannes went on, it’s clopin trouillefou
she went to pick up the hanging amphorae by the neck; she cooled her breast beneath the large fans, or amused herself burning cinnamon in hollow pearls
he was beginning to understand
the pontiffs of moloch walked over the great slab, examining the crowd
she saw in a dream blurred stars passing under her feet
such is the cathedral of rouen, which would be entirely gothic if the tip of its central spire did not dip into the renaissance zonenumber
their huts, of seaweed and slime, clung to the cliff like larks’ nests
he bent over and whispered in compère tourangeau’s ear in a voice too low to be heard by the archdeacon: i warned you that he was mad
a herald was immediately dispatched
it’s the end of manuscripts, the end of books!
the barrier was lowered; she was at once in the barbarians’ camp
his eminence is at this moment accompanying the most honourable embassy of monsieur the duke of austria; which is being delayed at the present moment while they listen to the address of monsieur the rector of the university at the porte baudets
a moment later she put a finger to her lips and beckoned to mahiette to come and look
look out that you don’t finish on the cross!
every evening, for a good hour
those irregular teeth, with gaps here and there like the battlements of a fortress, that calloused lip, over which one of those teeth protruded like an elephant’s tusk, that cleft chin, and above all the facial expression extending over the whole, a mixture of malice, amazement, and sadness
above it you can see the very delicately pierced bell tower
his absence leaves a vacuum which is felt only too keenly today
he’s not a clerk, he’s a layman
two coals seemed to burn in place of his eyes, which had no eyebrows left; a mass of wrinkled skin hung down over his forehead; his two ears, standing our from his head, were beginning to swell, and the deep creases which made semicircles around his nostrils gave him a strange and frightening look, like that of a wild beast
since the death of madame rolande it had rarely been vacant for a year or two
jehan prepared for a violent clash, but the deaf man stayed motionless; he had simply turned towards the student and was looking at him
on my way back i saw the rock white with their bones!
at about one o’clock in the morning the guests began to leave
the name reassured her
see, eye of baal,  he said, indicating a sturdy libyan, there is one we caught with a rope round his neck
was i then such a miserable creature, lord, that you couldn’t look at me before condemning me?
then, behind the town, at the back of megara, higher than the acropolis, appeared hamilcar’s palace
supposing the priests had hidden it?
the domes in the ceiling filtered through their gratings a pale light which projected something like luminous discs on the water, and the darkness around, thickening against the walls, pushed further back endlessly
the general characteristics of popular masonry on the other hand are variety, progress, originality, opulence, perpetual motion
she turned her head in the direction of the call, her shining eyes fixed on phoebus, and she stopped dead
she was full of despair at having seen the zaïmph, and yet this gave her a kind of joy, an intimate pride
at that moment the clock of notre-dame slowly struck noon
what should he do?
first of all people in the town must be dissatisfied
what have you done with her?
soon the mass, too compressed, ceased to advance: pikes clashed in the air and the barbarians’ arrows smashed against the walls
they say king louis xi is in paris
in three days it had completed the march from sicca, to come and exterminate everything in carthage
in the front rows numerous venerable figures are already seated, in their ermine, velvet, and scarlet hoods
lastly, a third audience, the noisiest, jolliest, and most numerous, jammed the benches and tables in the midst of which a shrill voice was perorating and swearing from beneath a set of heavy armour, complete from helmet to spurs
poland, catalonia, valogne, i always confuse those three provinces
the suffete learned this and could expect no help!
claude frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than phoebus, has seen in all this adventure no other bogeyman-monk than the archdeacon), claude frollo groped about for a moment or two in the dark recess where the captain had bolted him in
agathocles, regulus, caepio, any man of courage has only to land to take it; and when the libyans in the east come to an understanding with the numidians in the west, when the nomads come from the south and the romans from the north…’ a cry of horror arose: oh!
with each slash he traced around him a ring of severed limbs
is all in fine array
you swell the seashells!
narr’havas reminded him that he had exterminated hanno’s last cohorts – as for elephants, they were being hunted in the forests, he was arming soldiers, the horses were on the way; and the numidian, stroking the ostrich plume which fell down on his shoulder, rolled his eyes like a woman and smiled irritatingly
why did narr’havas not return?
now in some dim corner of the church you would collide with a kind of living chimera, squatting with a scowl; it was quasimodo thinking
may the devil squash your nose!—this is a fine beelzebub’s tavern where the wenches use the forks for combs!
he became an expert on fevers and contusions, wounds and abscesses
they probed and pried with their malicious words into her poor outlandish costume of sequins and gaudy rags
as our good plautus says:
once a wretched being had been buried down there it meant farewell to daylight, fresh air, life, ogni speranza [all hope]
what does the word la esmeralda mean?
it’s our prince from yesterday, our pope of fools, our bell-ringer, our one-eyed, grimacing hunchback!
the suffete needed soldiers: he would accept then unconditionally, so much did he admire their bravery
i’d rather give suck to a vampire
on his return to the sacristy he had ripped off alb, stole, and cope, tossed the lot into the hands of the astonished beadle; he had made his escape through the concealed door into the cloister, ordered a boatman from the terrain to take him across to the left bank of the seine, and had plunged into the steep streets of the university, without any idea where he was going, at every step running into bands of men and women gleefully hurrying towards the pont saint-michel in the hope of getting there in time’ to see the witch hanged; he was pale, distraught, more confused, more blind, more unapproachable than a night bird released and pursued by a pack of children in broad daylight
blood showered up into the foliage, and red shapeless masses howled as they writhed at the foot of the trees
he himself tightened the skeins of the balistae
i am not the king’s doctor, and his majesty has not given me the daedalus garden so that i can observe the constellations from it—don’t lose your temper, listen to me—what truth have you drawn, i won’t say from medicine, which is much too foolish, but from astrology?
she bowed her head
all those fine red copes!
at night all that could be distinguished of this mass of buildings was the dark serrated outline of the roofs unfolding their chain of acute angles round the place
never had a living creature come so close to nothingness
zarxas, among the balearics, stayed stretched out full length, hair over his arms, inert
then gradually as the sound increases they merge, blend, coalesce, all combine in one magnificent concert
that’s fair enough, isn’t it
spendius held him back; on the morning of the sixth he left
fashions have done more harm than revolutions
advance was impossible; it looked like a sea full of leaping red plumes with bronze scales, and the light-coloured shields rolling about like silver spray
the beer and cider vendors are rolling their barrels among the groups of people
then tortuous lines, the rues de la plâtrerie, de la verrerie, de la tixanderie, coiled over the whole
phoebus, my beloved phoebus, do you see me?
that doesn’t seem as clear to me as it does to you, maître pierre
and i can put an end to it whenever i choose to put on a frown
in such misfortune, in such a dungeon, she could no longer distinguish sleeping from waking, dream from reality, day from night
this is what we do
this only made their thirst more intolerable: and they had always before their eyes the long cascade of the clear water falling from the aqueduct
yet quasimodo was still there
you are provost-marshal, you have the men of your provostry; take them
she stood up, however, at an order from the guard, and walked quite steadily, preceded by charmolue and the priests from the officiality, between two rows of halberds, to a side door, which opened suddenly and closed behind her, making the dejected gringoire think of horrible jaws which had just devoured her
and the soldier’s kisses, more devouring than flames, ran over her; she was as though swept away in a hurricane, caught in the power of the sun
she owed that nature to the wandering life she had always led
think about all that and hold your tongue
men from every nation were there, ligurians, lusitanians, balearics, negroes, and fugitives from rome
the surface of this throng was grey, dirty, muddy
this book of granite was begun in the orient, carried on by greek and roman antiquity, and the last page was written in the middle ages
he felt vaguely uneasy with this man, who was at once so cowardly and so terrible
both parties had to put up with that
what does that mean—la esmeralda?
the king’s horsemen, in the midst of whom phoebus de châteaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the edge of the sword cut down any who escaped the thrust
a priest i don’t know
he came back to mâtho, took his arm
monsieur,  the stout man answered with a yawn, what for?
i have always been kind!
he understood her mime
in her inmost heart she was grateful to him for it
his tone was now sorrowful and gentle, contrasting painfully with the lofty harshness of his features
he remained for a moment without answering
the parvis was full of dense smoke which musket volleys streaked with fire
but narr’havas, going on, compared his desires to flowers drooping for want of rain, lost travellers waiting for the dawn
what would you say then, and what would become of your office, if i were a king like king chilperic, whose habit it was to hold his beard in his hand?
there was quite a wide crack in the worm-eaten door to his hole
to henriet cousin, master executioner of the justice of paris, the sum of number sols parisis, taxed and ordered to him by my lord the provost of paris, for purchasing, on the orders of the said monsieur the provost, one large broadsword to be used for executing and beheading those persons condemned by justice for their misdeeds, and providing it with a scabbard and all appurtenances; and likewise refurbishing and renovating the old sword, which had been splintered and chipped in carrying out sentence on messire louis de luxembourg, as may appear more fully …’
for the rest it had no windows or skylight, and the sloping angle of the roof made it impossible to stand up inside
she refused the coat as she had refused the flask and cake, and answered: a sack
my lord,  one of the archers said suddenly, ask the old hag why the bars on her window are all broken like that
suddenly a great galloping of horses filled the neighbouring streets, and with a long line of torches and a dense column of riders, riding with bridles dropped and lances ready, furious sounds swept through the square like a hurricane: france!
so that’s why my heart leaped each time you went by
the bronze arms went faster
he stayed mouth agape, head lowered, eyes fixed
they felt the need to transfer to others the surplus fury they had been unable to use against themselves
as she went past a lighted window, she made an effort, stiffened up abruptly, and cried: help!
when there were no weapons left to hold they wrestled bodily with each other; chests cracked against breastplates and corpses hung with head thrown back between stiffening arms
by all kinds of tricks hamilcar won over the village chiefs; and the mercenaries were driven off, repulsed, tracked down like wild beasts
don’t be afraid,  said a voice not unknown to her, it’s me
she hurried to get dressed
i have been shivering now for fourteen years in an iron cage
to ensure complete equality in their twin tensions, their cords were tightened by striking alternately to right and to left, until both sides sounded the same
despite the servants, someone wanted to come in; and as the noise increased hamilcar ordered the unknown person to be let in
he took a still smoking ember and threw it contemptuously on to the debris of his tent
gringoire could not stand it
her ardour rose at the gleam of the naked swords; she cried out with open arms
what was strange and profound about this impression was that it was indeed the strasbourg steeple, but a strasbourg steeple two leagues high, something incredible, gigantic, immeasurable, a structure such as had been seen by no human eye, a tower of babel
he was intending to incorporate the best of them into his troops and thus to promote defections
she repeated in alarm
round their mouths, fixed by two bronze chains, they wore a muzzle, to make it impossible for them to eat the flour, and their hands were encased in fingerless gloves to prevent them taking any
sometimes a whole town which needed repopulating was temporarily made a place of refuge
so it’s you, maître!
at that word, which had the same effect as the order to mount on a halted regiment, all the truands, men, women, children, rushed in a body out of the tavern with a great clatter of arms and old iron
suddenly you began to sing
meanwhile good dame aloïse, delighted to see them leaning together whispering like this, said as she played with the clasps of her book of hours: what a touching love scene!
the best tried to dig mines; the ground caved in for want of proper support
well, sister, you should rejoice,  said the priest, glacial as a statue on a tomb, she’s the one you are going to see die
the recluse had gone to sit down by her daughter, putting her own body in front of her as a shield, her eyes staring, listening to the poor child who did not stir and whose only utterance was a low murmur: phoebus!
they stripped him of shirt and doublet down to his waist, he let them do it
it pains us to have to add that, given the rigours of the season, he was using his tongue as a handkerchief
the priest had lied!
he saw and heard nothing more
monsieur, you are the only representative of the muses here,  said gringoire
assuming that he was some groom who had lost his way, the usher stopped him
the barbarians still could not climb them
he was almost as fond of the goat
from time to time the old lady addressed him in an undertone, and he replied as best he could with a clumsy and constrained sort of politeness
and now he is praising the romans!
he must have mixed up the cases!
but narr’havas, warned by his nurse’s son, had fallen upon cirta, poisoned the victors with water from their reservoirs, lopped off a few heads and restored order, so that he arrived more furious with the suffete than the barbarians
dragging out his words, he imitated salammbo’s voice, while his outstretched hands simulated two light hands playing on the cords of a lyre
then the barbarians heard a great cry
she was pale, she was sombre
ought i to have let them hang you?
this was the opinion of the veterans, that of mâtho himself, and it was decided that spendius would go and attack utica, mâtho hippo-zarytus; the third army corps, based on tunis, would occupy the plain of carthage
or rather crush your face against the ground!
none of them was the captain
that night la esmeralda had gone to sleep in her cell, filled with oblivion, hope, and sweet thoughts
once you used to obey; now you command an army, and if carthage is not conquered, we shall at least be granted the provinces; we shall become kings!
and if they appear i will crush them like vipers!
no,  she answered; and the eyes she had just closed out of fear she opened again out of curiosity
at night, alone in his tent, he contemplated the zaïmph
all right,  oudarde went on, offering her a flask, there’s some hippocras to warm you up
the common people, especially in the middle ages, are to society what the child is to the family
suddenly the recluse cried out, as though the gypsy’s question had taken all that time to get through to her mind: what have you done to me?
let’s see, my djali, have you forgotten any of your pretty tricks?
they wanted both to be convinced of his death and share in it
he heard them bawling out the old refrain:
may god have mercy on your soul!
it is an extreme point
there was no more room for doubt; the gypsies had held their sabbath on that heath, and had devoured the child in the company of beelzebub, as the mohammedans do
his chest heaved, his teeth were chattering
at the same time the two assistants began rummaging through their hideous arsenal
suddenly he turned round towards gringoire
i’ll come to the point now!
the girl looked at him again, then she flushed as though a flame had risen in her cheeks, and tucking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished onlookers towards the door of the house from which phoebus had called to her, slowly, unsteadily, and with the troubled look of a bird surrendering to the fascination of a snake
this apparition, which had always been so fateful for her and had driven her from misfortune to misfortune as far as the torture chamber, roused her from her torpor
meanwhile impatience gave way to anger
then, the choice must fall exclusively on the great families
then he took off his parti-coloured surcoat, and they saw hanging from his right hand a thin, slender whip of long, white, shiny, knotted, plaited thongs, armed with metal hooks
that’s a devilish bad start,  gringoire observed
he tried to soften her with soothing words, as one does with someone who is angry
then they went round the hot-springs mountain to avoid autharitus – and progressed so slowly that instead of catching the barbarians by surprise one morning, as the suffete had calculated, they only arrived in mid-afternoon on the third day
but now it was impossible to know how many mercenaries had been hired, and the elders were appalled at the exorbitant sum they would have to pay
no doubt the spokesmen had given themselves to the suffete
then he vaguely felt waken within him a jealousy he had never expected, a jealousy which made him go red with shame and indignation
schahabarim bit his lips
they had all climbed the ladder to come up on stage
she had realized that after trying to love a robber, the only man who might have wanted her; but after a little while she saw that the robber despised her
she clung to it as to her very life
then when the sun had completely set, he disappeared behind the nopal hedge, and that evening, at the assembly of the rich, in the temple of eschmoûn, he said as he went in:
all lands toiled around you, and the plains of the sea, ploughed by your oars, cradled your harvests
in phoenician architecture one is aware of the merchant, in greek of the republican, in gothic of the citizen
compère,  said louis xi, two companies of my men-at-arms and a volley from the serpentines would make short work of a mob of the common people
hell’s teeth,  gringoire objected, i’ll break my neck
now, as regards the number marcs, i haven’t yet been able to get them together
claude with his limping companion!]
but the latins were grieved not to be able to collect the ashes in urns; the nomads missed the hot sands in which bodies become mummified, and the celts missed the three rough stones, beneath a rainy sky, deep in a bay full of islands
is it because it’s printed?
she said, still glacial and unmoving; then why do you talk to me of living?
in the middle, on an island, stood a house for the marine suffete

ice enclosed underground for a thousand years turns into rock crystal; lead is the ancestor of all metals (for gold is not a metal, gold is light)—it takes lead only four periods, each of two hundred years, to pass successively from the state of lead to that of red arsenic, from red arsenic to tin, from tin to silver
very good, maître pierre, but how does it come about that you are now in the company of that dancer from egypt?
in the centre the île de la cité, looking like a huge tortoise in shape and thrusting out its bridges, scaled with tiles, like paws from beneath its grey carapace of roofs
i’ll wager my head against a slipper that you will have opened that door, taken the girl and stripped the high altar before even one of the beadles has woken up!
why didn’t you kill him?
at this the young gossips, becoming excited at the memory of the legate’s entry, both began talking at once
his people might be a collection of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars, no matter!
the gypsy smothered her with kisses
but there were not enough ships, and day broke with nothing decided
then, while guillaume rym, a wise and crafty man’ as philippe de commines puts it, followed both of them with a mocking and superior smile, they each went to their place, the cardinal quite put out and pensive, coppenole calm and haughty, reflecting no doubt that after all his title of hosier was as good as any other, and mary of burgundy, mother of the marguerite whom coppenole was marrying off that day, would have feared him less as a cardinal than as a hosier: for no cardinal would have stirred up the people of ghent against the favourites of charles the bold’s daughter; no cardinal would have steeled the crowd with a word against her tears and entreaties when the lady of flanders came to the very foot of the scaffold to beg her people for mercy on their behalf; while the hosier had only to lift his leather elbow to make both your heads roll, my most illustrious lords guy d’hymbercourt and chancellor guillaume hugonet!
master, there’s the moon coming out again—i only hope no one spots us!
the king remained silent for a moment, looking thoughtful, but pleased
ever since he had known the gypsy to be still alive, the chilling thoughts of spectre and tomb which had obsessed him for one whole day had vanished, and the flesh came back to goad him
he went up one of the lateral flights of steps leading to the altar, and walked on to the altar itself!
paying her fourpence: quattuor denarios
that phantom, that he-goat, that all smells of magic,  said one of gringoire’s neighbours
in the middle of the tent, on a mat where the captains went to sit down, was a dish of steaming gourds
it was the paving of the gallery running along the cisterns
i stop work, go out of my hosier’s shop into the street, and shout pillage!
in fact the barbarians had no sooner come down than men, crouching behind the rocks, had tipped them over, using beams of wood as levers; and as it was a steep slope, these enormous blocks, rolling headlong, had completely blocked the narrow opening
perhaps we are wrong to permit him to do so
i lose her, and that lasts fifteen years, then i find her again and that lasts one minute!
a waste of time
don’t you have your income from the gaol and palace bailiwicks, and the rent from all the houses, stalls, huts, and booths within the walls?
already a considerable army encroached upon it, by occupying the base of the isthmus, and soon it would perish of hunger, for they could not survive without help from the provinces, since, unlike rome, the citizens paid no taxes
there’s the little goat with golden hooves!
they have cut into the living flesh, attacked the bone-structure of the art underneath, they have hewn, hacked, dislocated, killed the building, in its form as in its symbolism, in its logic as in its beauty
to be accepted into argot you’ve got to prove that you are some use, and to do that you’ll have to search the dummy
they had taken refuge on top of the hill
so saying, the desolate gringoire kissed the king’s slippers, and guillaume rym whispered to coppenole: he does well to crawl on the ground
it was like the weight of mountains on my days; and yet something drew me on!
a papal bull granted them that right

do you know what friendship is?
but what’s to be done, messire?
one felt there the abiding presence of a spirit of noise and caprice singing out through all those bronze mouths

dead coals go with cold ash
they went to settle down further away, all determined to lay siege to carthage
how bitterly he saw the piecemeal collapse of his whole edifice of fame and poetry!
when they came out of the gardens they found their way blocked by the wall enclosing megara
guillaume rym was the only one to notice his eminence put to flight
all that could be seen from below were high walls going up endlessly, like the sides of a monstrous tomb
the man spying on them from the shadows had also recognized them, apparently, for he slowly followed all the zigzags which the student imposed on the captain, who as a more seasoned drinker had kept a perfectly cool head
why should i obey you then?
a few moments later the door of the retreat opened and then closed again on the five individuals whom the reader saw there at the beginning of this chapter, and who had now gone back to their places, their subdued conversations, and their attitudes
mâtho ordered wooden towers built to be as high as those of stone
she has a good memory,  observed fleur-de-lys

bright fires burned under hanging pots; and the crimson reflection of their flames lit up certain places and left others completely in darkness
he was hardly in one place before he was moving on to the next
what a tiresome mood you’re both in!

its fine skin, covered like the firmament with golden spots on a black background, was yellow now, flabby, wrinkled, and too big for its body; mildew extended like fluff round its head; and in the corner of its eyelids could be seen little red spots which seemed to move
he began by declaring that if it were a question of their courage they were worthy of them
some of them thought they were at the baths, because of the mist floating around them, or, noticing the foliage, imagined they were out hunting and ran upon their companions as though they were wild beasts
almost all were without a face or an arm; some still appeared intact; others were completely dried up and powdery skulls filled their helmets; fleshless feet stuck straight out of the cnemides, skeletons kept on their cloaks; bones, cleaned by the sun, made gleaming patches in the middle of the sand
maître pierre, it simply has to be done
a tall man went down into the water
over there is the abbey of saint-martin, singing sharp and cracked; here the gruff, sinister voice of the bastille; at the other end the great tower of the louvre, with its bass-baritone
no he hasn’t,  said jehan judiciously
have them flayed alive!
till tomorrow,  repeated gringoire
they ran to it
it’s a really bold countermine, and it will solve the problem for all of us
salammbo noticed, and pressed the amulet she wore upon her heart
not much—i have so many things—goodness, what a pretty little goat that was!
their chests heaved with great rasping breaths, and their eyes stared out from their long hair which hung down as though it had been in a bath of purple
he had divided his soldiers by even numbers, being careful to put alternately along the ranks a strong man and a weak, so that the less vigorous or more cowardly should be both led and pushed by two others
what could i do?
you no longer have to defend you the strong men of former days, who went beyond the oceans to build temples by the shore
over to the east the morning breeze chased across the sky a few white shreds of cottonwool torn from the hazy fleece covering the hills
i tell you,  clopin went on in a rage, that i’m not a jew, and i’ll have you hanged, by the synagogue’s belly!
a profound silence fell on the assembly, with some laughter, though muffled so that they could listen to all the ludicrous names and civic titles that each individual transmitted imperturbably to the usher, who then tossed names and titles in any order and much mangled down to the crowd
she interrupted him with a smile and a look full of the utmost sweetness: oh!
a second blow completed the collapse of the old iron crossbar which blocked the window
he was almost trembling for fear that she might want him
the girl submitted to it all, repeating at intervals, very softly and with infinite gentleness: mother!
i’ll let you know when you can come near
the only piece of furniture suitable for sleeping on was a fairly long wooden chest, though it had a carved lid, as a result of which when gringoire stretched out on it he felt somewhat like micromegas lying down full length across the alps
he wore black felt boots, sprinkled with silver moons
it is not very much—let us return to the real great hall of the real old palais
when mâtho arrived the moon was coming up behind her
and the cripple took up the musical phrase as he repeated: un pedaso de pan!
a hot wind blew
tristan l’hermite in his corner had the disgruntled expression of a mastiff which has seen but not had
a fourth small boy, squatting in the mud, was almost lost in a cauldron which he was scraping with a tile, producing a sound to make stradivarius swoon
the archdeacon silently contemplated the gigantic building for a while, then sighed as he stretched out his right hand towards the printed book lying open on his table and his left hand towards notre-dame, and looked sadly from the book to the church
said fleur-de-lys, the poor creature!
after a silence, louis xi again spoke up
remarkably enough, all the crowd, which had been in such an uproar a few minutes before, was now quite docile as it waited, trusting in the actor’s word, which goes to prove the eternal truth, still a matter of daily experience in our modern theatres, that the best way to get the public to wait patiently is to assure them that the play is about to begin at once
but how did she come to be by him, in his tent, at his mercy?
meanwhile the good mother, delighted to see the betrothed pair getting on so admirably together, had just left the apartment to attend to some domestic detail
le mur murant paris rend paris murmurant
what does my mother matter?
a woman hurled a stone at his head: that’ll teach you to wake us up at night with your damned ringing!
the suffete’s soldiers had by chance been unable to discover them, and as he had withdrawn from the battlefield, they were still in their deep pit
the attorney turned round aghast
i have just had a very narrow escape!
the man beckoned to gringoire and his companion to get into it
if all he needs for that is my curse, then i freely give it to him, his cathedral, and his mills!
my wife, according to what i was told by an old ruffian whom our people call the duke of egypt, my wife is a foundling, or a stray, which comes to the same thing
they had nothing to fear; any change of fortune meant an end to their troubles
they had not expected such clemency; spendius cried:
he was somewhat reassured by the fact that the condemned girl did not take her eyes off the floor of the tumbril
guillaume rym thought he should intervene: maître coppenole, you are talking to a mighty king
it was no doubt his sister
gringoire sighed, heartbroken, bassa latinitas [alas!
or if you do not want to, i will stay
in the centre of the eastern side of the place rose a heavy, heterogeneous construction consisting of three houses in juxtaposition
they hastily took the little clubfoot away
but when some houses had caught fire the remaining dead and dying had been quickly thrown over the walls; zarxas had kept to the reeds at the edge of the lake until the following day; then he had wandered round the countryside, trying to find the army from footprints in the dust
the person who entered wore a black robe and a gloomy expression
she was free, she was dead
that’s true, by god
in the syssitia buildings there were twelve hundred nubile slaves, some of those intended for prostitution in greece and italy, and their hair, made springy by the use of unguents, was wonderful for war machines
and from the very first moments, without anyone thinking of watching him, he had firmly secured to one of the colonnets of the gallery a stout knotted rope, its end trailing down on the steps below
hamilcar, not making it a point of pride to keep the battlefield for himself, had withdrawn a little further, to the left, on to heights from where he could dominate them
, pointing to the suffete’s guards, motionless in their gleaming armour
the great painted stars had stopped turning; the tabernacles had been set on the ground; and smoke from the censers rose straight up, like gigantic trees spreading out their blue branches amid the azure
she could hear no sound, detect no sign of human movement save from the cité, in uproar and glowing red, separated from her only by an arm of the seine, and from whence her own name reached her mixed with cries of death
it’s a brand new morality, never been used before
huge trunks of hippopotamus hide carried, at their corners, whole rows of smaller sacks; heaps of bullion lay in mounds on the floor; and here and there a pile had grown too high and had collapsed, to look like a ruined column
compère jacques, you should know
it’s me, look at me
they hurried in pursuit
the poor deaf creature whispered, fancy refusing that!
monsieur le docteur coictier, i was delighted to learn that your nephew, my reverend lord pierre versé, had been appointed to a bishopric
when next day the mercenaries resumed their task, the top of the walls was completely padded with bales of cotton, cloth, cushions; the battlements were closed with mats; and on the rampart between the cranes could be made out a row of pitchforks and cleavers stuck on to poles
hamilcar had made them extravagant promises, vague, to be sure, but solemn and repeated
a moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so violently that she sat up fully awake and furious
and what grievance do they have against the bailiff?
margaritas ante porcos [pearls before swine]
however, this cry, which frightened the gypsy girl, delighted a band of children who were prowling about
the three women retraced their steps, and when they were near the house of the tour-roland, oudarde said to the other two: we mustn’t all look into the hole at the same time in case we frighten the sachette
you are tiring yourself out with praying too long!
come on,  he added, where’s henriet cousin?
he was one of the temple servants, a man schahabarim used for dangerous missions
this time, on the contrary, she sat up as if with a start and listened eagerly
he ground his teeth and raised his great hand against spendius
as soon as he recognized hamilcar he rushed towards him, crying:
i beg your majesty …’
she knew nothing of obscene effigies, since with each god manifesting itself in different forms, cults that were often contradictory bore witness simultaneously to the same principle, and salammbo worshipped the goddess in her astral image
; sometimes a word devoid of any obvious sense: άναγνοϕαγία, perhaps concealing some bitter allusion to the regime of the cloister; sometimes a simple maxim of clerical discipline formulated as a regular hexameter: cœlestium dominum, terrestrem dicito domnum [call the lord of heaven dominus’, of earth domnus’]
o florian, you oaf!
he was witty, subtle, full of ideas and words; the barbarians grew used to his services; he won their affections
he had his eyes fixed on the tumbril
he leaped at one of the camels of the baggage train, tore off its halter; with the long rope he flogged the stragglers: and ran to right and left, alternately, at the rear of the army, like a dog driving a flock of sheep
they blocked their ears to the shooting, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, let the dispute be settled with or without the watch, and next day people in paris would tell each other: last night they broke into etienne barbette’s house
it was formed of two walls and packed with earth; the upper parts were knocked down
it is certain that if the soul had not yet left this inert, somnolent, lethargic body, it had at least withdrawn to hide in depths to which the perceptions of external organs no longer penetrated
my poor room with blood all over it, the captain stretched out full length with a dagger in his neck, the girl acting dead, and the goat quite terrified
but the more schahabarim felt himself doubting tanit, the more he wanted to believe in her
he needed some coastal base, so that he could bring in from the islands or cyrene provisions and soldiers, and he coveted the port of utica as being closest to carthage
finally, far off to the east, vincennes and its seven quadrangular towers; to the south, bicêtre and its pointed turrets; to the north saint-denis and its slim spire; to the west saint-cloud and its keep
on two lower seats were her father and her bridegroom
he said, grinding his teeth
he was more than a brother to the child, he became a mother to it
he had been waiting for a quarter of an hour; he felt as though he had aged by a hundred years
the rain beat on the terraces and overflowed, forming lakes in the courtyards, cascades down the steps, whirlpools at street corners
look, here it is!
the negresses’ heads made large black spots in the line of gold plated fillets which clasped the brows of the roman women
suddenly, as she struggled, crawling on the floor, the gypsy’s hand touched something cold and metallic
the archdeacon spoke with authority
the small chapel facing the marble table was chosen as the scene for the face-pulling
then lying flat on him he slowly pulled out the entrails with the end of his teeth
ladders were put out for them; they all rushed to them
in order to penetrate the deepest mysteries of her dogma, she wanted to know the old idol in the most secret recesses of the temple with its magnificent cloak on which depended the destiny of carthage – for the idea of a god did not clearly emerge from its representation, and to hold or even see its image was to remove a part of its strength and, in some way, to dominate it
but their anger with the suffete had not abated; they shouted parting threats at him, and hamilcar replied:
it still seems as if it happened yesterday!
he’s yelling loud enough to deafen a cantor,  continued gauchère
people were expressing annoyance, still quietly, it is true
the latter were the most violent

it was indeed the rector and all the university dignitaries going in procession to meet the embassy, and at that moment crossing the place du palais
he opened his cassock
the wretched woman began to laugh her wild laugh
the gypsy girl made no reply
you will be so happy!
for earrings she had two little sapphire scales holding a hollow pearl filled with liquid perfume
now there would be the frightening sight of a bizarre dwarf on top of one of the towers, climbing, wriggling, crawling on all fours, coming down the outside over the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, delving into the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was quasimodo dislodging crows
at last the members of the grand council made up their minds
they were in agony
they were a troop of  slingers who had come in the previous day, and who, on that day, had overslept
indeed,  said phoebus, as though looking for some accommodation with himself, to encounter a sword or a girl are both delightful assignations; but i don’t see why i should give up one for the other when i can have both
he let her go: degrade me, hit me, be vicious!
at once the earth shook – and the barbarians saw charging, in a single line, all the elephants of carthage with their tusks gilded, their ears painted blue, armoured in bronze, and with leather towers shaking about on top of their scarlet caparisons, with three archers in each holding great open bows
finally, no longer knowing what to do or what would become of me, i denounced you to the official
a pack of beggars, who have become good friends of mine, taught me twenty kinds of herculean tricks, and now every evening i give my teeth the bread they have earned during the day by the sweat of my brow
the priest, upright, angry, menacing, imperious: quasimodo prostrate, humble, suppliant
said the whole crowd with one voice
it gave on to a narrow passage
with each step she took forward, he took one back, and that was all
gringoire stammered, i haven’t got so much as a denier parisis
at the same time the little goat put itself in front of her, and confronted gringoire in battle order, bristling with two pretty, gilded, and very sharp horns
then the porters, the sutlers, the slaves began to murmur, and no one, neither the people nor the grand council, sent even a hope
behind the bastille a score of poor cottages huddled round the curious sculptures of the croix-faubin and the flying buttresses of the abbey of saint-antoine-des-champs; then came popincourt, lost among the cornfields; then la courtille, a merry village full of taverns; the bourg saint-laurent, with its church, the steeple from a distance looking like an addition to the pointed towers of the porte saint-martin; the faubourg saint-denis, with the vast enclosure of saint-ladre; outside the porte montmartre, the grange-batelière girdled with white walls; behind, with its chalky slopes, montmartre, which at that time had as many churches as windmills, but has kept only the windmills, for all that society now demands is bread for the body
my name is pierre gringoire, and i am the poet whose morality play was performed this morning in the great hall of the palais
the men, the architects, the artists of our own day
gisco was dismissing them, but i did not want the interpreters to be able to speak
next morning she realized when she woke up that she had been asleep
then, suspended over the abyss, launched on the fearsome swinging of the bell, he seized the bronze monster by its lugs, gripped it with both knees, spurred it on with both heels and added the whole shock and weight of his body to increase the frenzy of the peal
and he fell back into his chair in an attitude of one powerful and inspired
then hamilcar went extraordinarily pale, and those who were leaning outside over the pit saw him put a hand against the wall to prevent himself from falling
you can’t escape now, even if you had the pope’s bowels to digest with
he was too ugly
the girl seemed to be taking no notice of him; she came and went, moved a stool, talked to her goat, pouted now and then
what i say, master, is that they won’t hang me maybe, but will hang me indubitably
i like such plain speaking
i sent for oxen from hecatompylus, i sent out hunters into the desert!
here the louis xiii churches, heavy, squat, surbased, stocky, weighed down with a dome like a hump
no doubt this strange beacon would awaken in the distance the woodman of the bicêtre hills, terrified at seeing the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame wavering over his heath
they gulped down all the greek wines that come in wineskins, campanian wines kept in amphorae, cantabrian wines brought over in casks, as well as wines of cinnamon, jujube, and lotus
he added: besides, we are old friends
i have to say men of the art’ since there have been individuals in the past two centuries who have assumed the title of architect
unable to get rid of it, hearing your song always ringing in my heart, seeing your feet always dancing over my breviary, feeling always in my dreams at night the smooth touch of your shape upon my flesh, i tried to see you again, to touch you, to find out who you were, to see if i would find you anything like the ideal image of you which had remained with me, perhaps to break my dream with the reality
she seized it with a convulsion of hope, put it to her lips and blew with all her remaining strength
stones from the catapults and demolitions ordered for defence purposes had piled a heap of ruins in the middle of the streets
at that moment the curtain of the dressing room described earlier parted, and through it came an individual whose mere appearance stopped the crowd and as if by magic changed its anger into curiosity
as the priest drew nearer this smile became clearer, more distinct, more radiant
as for flight, what way was there?
where’s the benefit for me?
it was indeed a quite marvellous grimace that was just then beaming through the hole in the rose-window
you freed me from the prison
the elephants halted; they swung their massive heads, loaded with ostrich feathers, and beat their trunks against their shoulders
i give you simon radin’s office
though his conscience rebelled he committed appalling deeds, imagining that he was obeying a god’s voice
he witnessed countless little scenes between the gypsy and the deaf man, whose pantomime, seen from a distance and commented on by his own passion, seemed most affectionate
she turned her head with the sharp, abrupt movement of a steel spring, her two long, skinny hands came up to push the hair back from her forehead, and she looked at the boy in bitter, hopeless amazement
she looked up at the magistrate with her large, staring eyes, and answered like a machine, without tension or tremor: yes
that is what he called coming to a tragic end’
kyrie eleison,  repeated the crowd in a murmur running over their heads like water lapping in a choppy sea
her face was covered by a white scarf wound over her mouth and forehead, so that only her eyes could be seen; but her lips shone through the transparent material like the jewels at her fingers – for salammbo kept both hands wrapped up, and all the time they were speaking she did not make a gesture
such was the pope whom the fools had just given themselves
to be a poet and have as much success as an apothecary!
her slave slowly raised her up, for according to the rites someone had to come and tear the suppliant from her prostration; that meant that the gods approved, and salammbo’s nurse never failed in this pious duty
this all happened so fast that had it been night time, everything could have been seen by the light of a single flash of lightning
that was infallibly what was going to happen
[when the coloured birds are silent and the earth …]’
they stopped  yards from the camp to pull out from the sheaths on their saddle-bows their round shields, broad swords and boeotian helmets
he frothed and twisted, like some marine monster being butchered on the shore, predicting that their end would be still more horrible and that he would be avenged
the student finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and swung over very nimbly to the applause of all the truandery
that is the charming turret which occupies the northern corner of the place and which, already buried beneath the ignoble coats of distemper which clog the bold lines of its carvings, will perhaps soon have disappeared, submerged by the rising flood of new buildings so rapidly swallowing up all the old façades of paris
come,  said charmolue, carry her on to the cart and let’s get this finished!
he resolved to devote himself entirely to a future, for which he would answer before god, and never to have any other spouse, any other child than the happiness and prosperity of his brother
without constraint, with all your heart, with the intention of carrying out your promises?
they added that people had met him one evening of the previous month, in the middle of the mappalia, led by an old man
she met monsieur le curé of saint-rémy and told him: monsieur le curé, i’ll plough the earth with my fingernails, but give me back my child!—it was heart-rending, oudarde; and i saw one very hard man, maître ponce lacabre, the prosecutor, weeping
what a tiresome, disagreeable hussy,  said one old judge, having them apply the question to her when we have not yet had supper!
that same night quasimodo was not asleep
as she entered this room she was struck with horror
the rope is a death like any other, or, to be more precise, it is not like any other death
they did not know how to answer so much talking
the gypsy girl had suffered so much that all that now remained was astonishment
fortunately someone came to rescue him and assume responsibility
it was for him one of those moments of selfish, exclusive, supreme delight when the artist sees in the world only art and sees the world in art
so he was running away; and sailing northwards, he disappeared into the haze
that’s all you know about her?
then from the compartments round the wall he took two purple squares, put one on the boy’s chest, the other on his back, and joined them at the collarbone with two diamond clasps
envious of what, monsieur the archdeacon?
he swept the horizon with a haughty look as if to say all that is now mine!
a warm, heavy fog, such as comes in these regions at the end of winter, fell upon the army on the fourteenth day
he cried in despair
claude frollo was no longer the simple student of the collège de torchi, loving protector of a little child, the dreamy young philosopher who knew a lot of things and was ignorant of many more
salammbo, used to eunuchs, was lost in wonder at this man’s power
and it’s now that she is beautiful, grown up, talking to me, loving me, it’s now they come to devour her, before my eyes, i, her mother!
exclaimed maître jehan as he came out of his hole, the two screech-owls have gone
she asked in a changed voice
the dog and his master
then, standing up on his barrel: nobody wants him?
to the right of the tournelles, that enormous bundle of inky-black towers, running one into another, and lashed together, so to speak, by a circular moat, that keep with far more loopholes than windows, that drawbridge kept always raised, that portcullis always lowered, that is the bastille
she said, the man’s drunk
this figure, which looked as though it were fixed to the floor, seemed to be without movement, thought or breath
next day she took advantage of a moment when the child was asleep on her bed, for she always put it to sleep with her, very quietly left the door ajar, and hurried to tell one of the neighbours in the rue de la séchesserie that the day would come when her daughter agnès would be served at table by the king of england and the archduke of ethiopia, and lots of other surprising things
there’s always some broken cask lying around
go back to carthage!
swear to carry out all my orders, to follow me like a shadow!
giddenem soon came back, presenting a young boy
you’ve never seen anything more amorous than her eyes, more rounded than her legs, more noble than her attitude, better draped than her skirt
for the moment it is a stock exchange
a proper leech pulled off a barrel
unless it was built on piles, like notre-dame, a palace, a fortress, a church, always had a double bottom
he seemed to make it a point of honour to swallow it
beauty only loves beauty,
we have absolutely no idea
you saw at once two long, parallel streets, running without a break, without disturbance, almost in a straight line, crossing each of the townships from end to end, from south to north, at right angles to the seine, connecting and mingling, then, constantly infusing, pouring, and decanting the people from one into the walls of another, and making the three into one
as they recognized several of the proper names which had caught their ear, the mercenaries were convinced that he was giving an exact account of the suffete’s speech
they were full of anxiety
one could just make out by the beams of a little light a sort of hut, shaped like a beehive, where the ferryman sheltered at night
their hands were hidden in their sleeves, their feet beneath their gowns, their eyes beneath their caps
how did he manage to be here, the old gambler?
at last they made out a large black snake
i looked for you
meanwhile our philosopher reflected
then the soldiers’ delegates and those of the grand council were reconciled, swearing by the genius of carthage and the gods of the barbarians
i’ll just tell them you escaped, that i let you go
he was now irrevocably lost
whoever can that be, standing beside the trestle with his black smock and pale face?
surrounded by his sons, giving orders to his happy slaves, counting on the wall how many necklets of honour his country has given him?
then he said to her aloud: girl, have you asked god’s forgiveness for your faults and failings?
the story of the cake
cries rose up; a fearful glare blazed behind the canvas
the gypsy was not indifferent to these pinpricks
they stretched out their arms over the chains, crying that he had been allowed too wide a path; and he went, probed, pricked, ripped by all these fingers; when he reached the end of one street, another appeared, several times he hurled himself sideways to bite them, they quickly drew away, the chains held him back, and the crowd burst out laughing
where are you going then, tybalde ad dados [thibaut the dice], turning your back on the university and trotting off towards the town?
phoebus replied, it’s all the same to me
we parisians are generally mistaken in thinking how much ground we have acquired since then
he was a sombre and imposing person, before whom trembled the choirboys in their alb and gown, the machicots, the brethren of saint augustine, the early morning clergy of notre-dame, as he slowly passed beneath the high arches of the choir, majestic, pensive, with his arms folded and his head bent so low on his chest that all that could be seen of his face was his great bald forehead
it is hard to convey any idea of the degree of proud and blissful satisfaction which the hideous, mournful features of quasimodo had come to express in the course of the journey from the palais to the grève
on the furnace were heaped in disorder all kinds of vessels, stone flasks, glass retorts, charcoal matrasses

curfew had sounded an hour before, night had fallen, and there was only a flickering wax candle on the table to provide light for five individuals variously grouped around the room
moreover, it may be added, the captain had been thinking for the past few moments of the deep darkness of the night, of the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral tones of the strange messenger, that it was past midnight, that the street was as deserted as it had been that evening when the bogey-monk had accosted him, and that his horse snorted when it looked at quasimodo
their golden bracelets leaped up and down amid the floating folds of their cloaks

we say rue coupe-gorge
but in a short time all these attempts at communal legislation fell into disuse

the pitcher broke into four pieces
two esquires, corpus christi!
quasimodo, who could not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the pikeheads, all this cavalry, at whose head he recognized captain phoebus; he saw the truands, thrown into confusion, the terror of some, the agitation of the best of them, and this unhoped-for aid so revived his strength that he hurled off the church the first attackers who were already stepping over the gallery
the priest’s eyes were fixed, haggard, blazing, and remained riveted to the horrible little group of the fly and the spider
she stood there aghast and stupefied
the guards of the legion galloped at random; people went up on to houses, terraces, the shoulders of colossi and into the masts of ships
muttered phoebus, here’s a nasty, scruffy customer i seem to have seen somewhere before!
he continued, musing and as though talking to himself: very nice
she is sitting on wheatsheaves, and has a handsome garland round her head of ears of corn interwoven with salsify and other flowers
a cloud of grey dust drifted down

they were lined up along the rampart, beating tambourines, plucking lyres, shaking castanets, and the rays of the sun setting behind them in the mountains of numidia struck through the strings of the harps, on which their bare arms stretched out
when would you like me to have that little enchantress picked up?
that force of sex and blood in the grown man which, as a foolish youth i thought i had stifled for life, had more than once convulsively shaken the iron chain of vows binding me, poor wretch, to the cold stones of the altar
there was, however, a certain air of gentleness about that face, but the gentleness of a cat or a judge, an affected gentleness
it’s the recluse from the tour-roland,  they shouted, laughing wildly, it’s the sachette grumbling!
the condemned girl held up in her teeth the shift which had not been properly fastened
when she withdrew her head from the window her face streamed with tears
mâtho went round the terrace, hugging the walls
opposite the tall cathedral stained red by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built over the porch of a handsome gothic mansion, standing on the corner of the place and the rue du parvis, some lovely young girls were laughing and chatting in the most delightful and light-hearted manner
they shouted, leaped up, and the most cheerful began telling stories; the bad times were over
some resentment, however, still smouldered in the captain’s heart: too bad if the devil’s muck-cart picks you up as it goes by!
maître jacques charmolue paraded at their head
i don’t really know … a trifle, a horse, a remark!
who stupidly fixed that heavy stone anachronism into hercandus’ carolingian pavement?
let your anger go like a runaway chariot,  said spendius

her lyre dropped, she fell silent – and pressing both hands to her heart, she stayed for some moments with her eyes closed, savouring the excitement of all these men
if i wanted …’
feed what should be hanged!
behind rose the forest of slender spires of the tournelles palace
one of these towers had been converted by the truands into a place of entertainment
as he passed by the door of the ringing chamber, which stood ajar, he saw something that struck him; he saw quasimodo, leaning at an opening of those slate louvres which look like huge venetian blinds, also looking down on to the square
spendius would have spat upon the images of olympian jupiter; yet he was afraid to speak loudly in the dark, and never failed every day to put his right shoe on first
it was like a snake following her
coictier calmed down, muttering under his breath: after all, he’s mad

but the marine suffete, a priestly magistrate under the sun’s protection, was inviolable, so long as the assembly of the rich had not judged him
she looked up at him in astonishment
she’s in the rue de glatigny
these men, accustomed to war, found it boring to stay in a town: they were easily convinced, and the people went up on the walls to see them go away
a broad, deep moat, fast-flowing during the winter floods, washed the foot of the walls all round paris; the seine provided the water
the greek tore from his hands a roll of papyrus filled with phoenician writing
with it she rubbed her ears, heels, her right thumb, and her nail indeed stayed slightly red, as if she had squashed a fruit
you are behaving like the rhinoceros who tramples in its own excrement: you are displaying your stupidity!
she will call, her slaves will run up and, for all your strength, you will die!
a second blow followed the first, then a third, and another, continously
each night his delirious imagination depicted la esmeralda to him in all the attitudes which had most set fire coursing through his veins
he stayed like that for over an hour without stirring, his eye fixed on the deserted cell, more gloomy and pensive than a mother sitting between an empty cradle and a full coffin
the town, the largest of the three portions of paris, had the right bank
the suffete meanwhile had breached the outer walls and got as far as the citadel

hanno contented himself with blocking the port without risking an attack
on the face of this old queen of our cathedrals, beside each wrinkle you will find a scar

on the wall facing the barbarians, they brought up tree trunks, millstones, jars full of sulphur, tubs full of oil, and built furnaces

their fine white gorgets, their red-and-white striped tiretaine skirts, their white knitted stockings, with coloured embroidery at the ankles, pulled trimly over the leg, their square shoes of fawn leather with black soles, and especially their headdress, a sort of tinsel horn loaded with ribbons and lace, such as women still wear in champagne, in common with the grenadiers of the russian imperial guard, proclaimed that they belonged to that class of rich tradespeople which comes midway between what servants call a woman’ and what they call a lady’
take monsieur de châteaupers with you
explain yourself on all these points—clerk, have you written down what the accused has said so far?

suddenly small stones rolled down from above
barbarians whom i once commanded chained me up by the arms and legs, like some murderous slave
he came up to gringoire, who seemed to be sunk in profound reverie, his feet up on a firedog

because with us when a woman gives a soldier a drink,  said the gaul, she is offering him her bed
this detonation woke up the peaceful occupants of the houses round about, several windows could be seen opening, and nightcaps and hands holding candles appeared at the casements
the archdeacon’s pale face blushed as red as a young girl’s cheek
he had frail limbs, a slanting skull, a pointed chin; his skin looked cold to the touch, and his hollow face, furrowed by deep wrinkles, looked as if it was contracted in some eternal longing, some grief
the pointed arch, dominant from then on, constructed the rest of the church
phoebus, then, quickly put his mind at rest concerning the enchantress esmeralda, or similar, as he called her, the stabbing by the gypsy or the bogey-monk (it mattered little to him which), and the outcome of the trial
his stomach overflowed on to the scarlet jacket that covered his thighs: the folds of his neck fell down to his chest like an ox’s dewlaps, his tunic, painted with flowers, was split at the armpits; he wore a scarf, a belt, and a full black cloak with double laced sleeves
the spectacle is indeed a curious one, well worthy of the spectators’ attention
one morning she found a birdcage on her window
the gates were closed

the loveliest black eyes!
there was a light in one of the ground-floor windows
he was not laughing any more, he was terrible, pacing up and down, a fox turned into a hyena, he seemed to be so choked that he could not speak, his lips moved, and his bony fists clenched
for several days now he had been on his guard
innocent and venerable infancy of art and stage machinery!
but the care of his body did not interrupt his concern for the welfare of the state, and he was dictating a letter to the grand council and, as some prisoners had just been taken, wondering what terrible punishment to invent
the duke of egypt sadly pointed out to him the two streams of boiling lead which continuously streaked down the black façade, like two long distaffs charged with phosphorus
when quasimodo, who had never for a moment stopped fighting, saw this rout, he fell to his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, drunk with joy, he ran, he went up as swiftly as a bird to the cell whose approaches he had so dauntlessly defended
and he added a few vague words about the public problems which he hoped to resolve alone
it meant that one power would succeed another

when the student saw himself disarmed, stripped, weak, and naked in those redoubtable hands, he did not try to speak to the deaf man, but began laughing insolently in his face and singing in the carefree, dauntless way of a lad of number, the currently popular song:
it was a long session
gringoire heroically endured this new encounter
the slave lit the perfumes

mâtho had said to himself that if he could pass between the walls and narr’havas’ tents quickly enough for the numidians to have no time to come out, he would fall on the rear of the carthaginian infantry, which would be caught between his division and those of the inside
meanwhile maître florian, the auditor, attentively leafed through the dossier of the charges brought against quasimodo, which the clerk handed him, and once he had glanced at it, seemed to be reflecting for a moment
let him have his say, monsieur rym, my friend,  said the king
there’s someone wants a word with you

they are expensive animals,  said louis xi
the abbot of saint-germain-des-prés had battlements like a baron, and spent more on bronze for bombards than for bells
carthage was full of joy – deep, universal, boundless, frenetic joy; the holes in the ruins had been filled in, the gods’ statues repainted, branches of myrtle were strewn over the streets, incense smoked at crossroads, and the crowd on the terraces with its multi-coloured clothes looked like heaps of flowers opening out in the air
if i had,  the archdeacon replied, pronouncing the words slowly, like a man reflecting, the king of france would be called claude and not louis
and to the scorpions: pierce them to the heart!
suddenly she felt the stranger’s hand upon her own

they read your hand and told you the most amazing prophecies

she went on slowly, staring fixedly at her daughter
leaving aside here the less important peculiarities of old paris, and the caprices of right of way, we may say in general, taking only the overall pattern and major features in the chaos of communal jurisdiction, that the island belonged to the bishop, the right bank to the provost of merchants, the left bank to the rector of the university
only one tent remained
the captain, emboldened by her docility, put his arm round her waist without meeting any resistance, then began very quietly unlacing the poor child’s bodice, and disarranged her gorget to such an extent that the priest, breathing heavily, saw the gypsy’s bare shoulder emerge from the gauze, round and brown, like the moon rising on a misty horizon
spendius, autharitus, and zarxas, four italiots, a negro, and two spartans offered themselves as spokesmen

the king of tunis frowned
exclaimed the poor unhappy child, at the same time clinging to the captain and making him sit beside her
and they would have hanged it too, wouldn’t they?
on top of the acropolis, the dungeon door, cut into the rock at the foot of the temple, had just opened; and in this black hole a man stood at the entrance
of the kingdom of argot
meanwhile maître philippe lheulier, advocate extraordinary to the king, intervened again: may i remind you, messieurs, that in the deposition taken down at his bedside, the murdered officer, while declaring that the thought had vaguely occurred to him at the moment when the man in black accosted him that he might very well be the bogey-monk, added that the phantom had keenly pressed him to enter upon familiar relations with the accused, and on his observing, i mean the captain, that he had no money, had given him the écu with which the said officer had paid la falourdel
and i’ve no money left!
from time to time a river came into sight with the green of tamarisks, only to disappear as it went round the hills
in former times this cell had been constructed almost on top of the tower, among the crows’ nests, by bishop hugo of besançon,number who had practised the black arts there in his time
it was like a hurricane whirling round him
they wielded cutlasses split into several branches like antelopes’ antlers, pruning hooks fastened to the end of a rope, iron triangles, clubs, punches
spendius beckoned to him, and led him to a fold in the ground where zarxas and autharitus were hiding
others had silver arrows in their hair, emerald butterflies, or long needles fanning out in the sun

the pointed steeple of saint-sulpice marked one of the corners of the bourg
the barbarians jostled each other and shouted
the sky was low and cloudy
it was an obsession
of the twin sounds that a church makes, the organ within, the bells without, only the organ was left

there are only a few, but it is a superior kind of audience, an educated audience
this gigantic man, master of the zaïmph, dominated the rabbetna as much as baal did and appeared to her surrounded by the same lightning flashes; then the gods’ souls, sometimes, visited men’s bodies
bowing his head with its assyrian mitre, he looked at the gold plate on his breast covered with fateful stones, to which the reflection of the flames imparted irridescent gleams
he thought of how the meadows smelled on autumn mornings, of snowflakes, of how the aurochs lowed when they were lost in the mist, and closing his eyes, he imagined he could see the fires of the long, straw-roofed huts, flickering over the marshes, in the depths of the woods
the compère answered in the same low tones, with a bitter smile
however, under so many different names, they were still only two streets, but two parent streets, the two generators and arteries of paris
the archdeacon put in
ropes of pearls fastened to her temples fell to the corners of her mouth, rose red like a half-open pomegranate
the president bent over to a man at his feet, wearing a gold cap and a black robe, a chain round his neck, and a staff in his hand
he had clung to it, embodied himself in it, identified himself with it
cried salammbo, i shall see her, shan’t i?
but gringoire only tried harder and cried still more loudly: start again!
at the cardinal’s entrance it seemed as though a magic, invisible thread had suddenly drawn every eye from the marble table to the tribune, from the southern end of the hall to its western side
very well, comrades,  cried out the marcandier, on to notre-dame!
no character so unexpected, no twist of plot, no dramatic suspense but had to climb this ladder
in the middle he put the etruscans, all linked together with a bronze chain; the archers were behind, and on the two wings he distributed the naffur, mounted on shaven camels, covered with ostrich feathers
and a salvo from crossbows and arquebuses was fired at the front of the church
put it all together as best you may
they shook it, it gave, and they found themselves on the steps of a staircase

mâtho meanwhile was besieging hippo-zarytus
master, just now the carthaginians are sure of their victory

but then he would be between the two armies, a piece of imprudence he could not commit with scanty forces
the poor cicada stopped dead
they ran, calling to each other to welcome the elders
one more day like this and the war would be over!

it made him swell out like a bird in the sunshine
we have tried everything we’ve got, as the old comedian plautus has it:
as for those who went to buy chalcedony along the road of syrtes and the temple of ammon, they had doubtless perished in the sand

he pushed him away with a caress
the slaves were about to hurl themselves on him

at the very most he would watch anxiously when dom claude went up the tower staircase, but the archdeacon had of his own accord refrained from appearing again before the gypsy’s eyes
being stunned, petrified, as though asphyxiated by the immeasurable tirades continually erupting from every part of his epithalamium
the little open-work rose-window pierced over the doorway was in particular a masterpiece of lightness and grace; it looked like a star woven from lace

this did not increase her fright, but transformed it
but shaven greeks, whiter than marble, threw behind them the peelings from their plate, while shepherds from bruttium, dressed in wolf skins, munched in silence, heads bent over their food
a dog was running along the wall
the suffete and the slave went off into a distant corner of the room
the hearing was suspended
all the stewards stood with arms crossed, heads bowed, while abdalonim proudly lifted his pointed mitre

at his feet a few hens were pecking as they foraged in the undergrowth, enamelled beetles ran about in the sunshine; above his head a few clusters of dappled-grey clouds were scudding across a blue sky; on the horizon the steeple of the abbey of saint-victor thrust its slate-covered obelisk across the curving contour of the hillside, and the miller of the butte copeaux whistled as he watched the sails of his windmill diligently spinning round
dogs were roaming about with their black muzzles stained with red
djali,  said the girl

there, sitting above them,  gringoiure went on, who is that stout, red-faced man all in a sweat?
it’s a fine way for a king to be lavish
you must have good eyesight if you can recognize him from here!
mâtho seemed to see them and grew angry
in your place you left me, my fair one,  went on the captain, whose tongue was loosened now that he was speaking to a girl from the streets, a pretty surly rascal, one-eyed and hunchbacked, the bishop’s bell-ringer, as i believe
what does it matter to you?
all kinds of people follow behind poets
we have only to draw the curtains

here and there along its length vague, shapeless masses crawled, all moving towards the light flickering at the end of the street, like those heavy insects which at night drag themselves along from one blade of grass to the next towards a shepherd’s fire
what did you do with it?
he stopped for a moment, leaned against a marker-stone like a drunken man, then again took up the trail of the two merry rascals
i know that phoebus isn’t dead!
dramatic surprise, reversal of fortune
and she heard a still more bitter voice tell her in her inmost heart: she’s a rival!
dom claude, sunk deep in his own thoughts, was no longer listening
said dom claude, this is the last money you will get from me
i don’t know,  answered gringoire
… nothing easier—a sudden raid—under cover of the disorder, she can easily be snatched away
i want you to tell me if you love me

it is not a virtue of which the finest examples are to be found among men
but the nearer she came to it, the slower her steps

don’t go lying to me, you old spectre,  he went on
he swore to himself, since his companions had appointed him schalischim, to wage war; the certainty that he would not come back alive drove him to make it ruthless
the three men in black robes were waiting for him in the great hall, standing against the stone disc
hamilcar had done this to gratify his army’s instincts and, by this treachery, to bind them to himself
i am only a historian
the archdeacon replied unmoved: there are certain things which i think about in a certain way
but why was he sending it off?
djali,  she said, how i had forgotten you!
half-eaten corpses blocked the streets
it is notre-dame the people are besieging
but the town was protected by a lake communicating with the sea

the king spoke so quietly that the flemings could not hear anything of his dictation except occasional isolated scraps like: … maintain fertile areas by trade, and infertile ones by manufacture … show the english lords our four bombards, the london, the brabant, the bourg-en-bresse, the saint-omer … artillery is the reason why war is waged now more judiciously … to monsieur de bressuire, our friend … armies cannot be maintained without tribute … etc
she had been wanting a child for a long time
she stuck out her lower lip in her pretty little pout
meanwhile daylight continued to fade
finally, right at the back, near the door, there stood in the dark, still as a statue, a sturdy, thick-set man, in military equipment, and an emblazoned tunic, whose square face, with eyes sticking out from his head, split by a huge mouth, ears concealed beneath two wide screens of flattened hair, with no forehead, took after both dog and tiger
then a garamant came through the crowd, brandishing a sickle; everyone understood his intention; their faces flushed deeply and full of shame they shouted: yes!

but taanach set up in front of her a copper mirror of such height and breadth that she could see all of herself in it
the few lights went out, the broader streets fell silent, then shadows slipped through the darkness

to soften him salammbo said plaintively:
and as he spoke the young rascal was stealthily getting his crossbow ready
in the midst of his reverie there was a knock at the door
gringoire suddenly exclaimed, we are as bright and cheerful as [if we had all been changed into owls like] ascalaphus!

what have the years, what have men done to these marvels?
the young student jehan frollo du moulin cried out from his corner

it was jehan du moulin who struck the first spark
the aforesaid dolphin, then, was young, handsome, strong, and above all (magnificent origin of all the royal virtues!)
as the house goes up i am being ruined
meanwhile the clerk, just as maître florian barbedienne was reading over the sentence in his turn before signing it, felt moved by pity for the poor devil who had been condemned and, in the hope of obtaining some mitigation of the punishment, came as close as he could to the auditor’s ear and said to him, pointing to quasimodo: that man is deaf
the moon was rising at sea level, and specks of light, of whiteness shone out over the town, still plunged in darkness; a wagon shaft in a courtyard, a scrap of cloth hanging up, the corner of a wall, a golden collar on a god’s chest
he had returned to a position a few yards from them, behind his pillar, where he listened, watched, relished
and to you, mighty men in shining armour who have set me free!
the other barbarians, encamped away on the isthmus, were surprised at these delays; they muttered; and they were let loose
wrinkles and warts on its skin are the work of time; marks of violence, brutality, contusions, fractures, the work of revolutions from luther to mirabeau
for a time he hesitated
they thought how empty their courage was
he said, what a big letter!
hamilcar was in despair; all were going to perish thanks to mâtho’s genius and the mercenaries’ invincible courage!
it came from a dummy which the truands were suspending with the rope round its neck, a kind of scarecrow, dressed in red, and laden with enough jingling, tinkling little bells to provide the harness for thirty castilian mules
in the sixteenth century the wall seemed to be visibly withdrawing, buried deeper and deeper in the old town, so dense already was the new one beyond it
where were the days when father guybertaut could earn number sols parisis with a song at a single coronation?

what say you, maître guillaume rym?
then mâtho, raising his arm towards the planet of chabar, cried:
mighty carthage, mistress of the seas, splendid as the sun and terrible as god, there existed men who dared to attack her!
but he was not even tempted to go and see her there
quasimodo could not hear the laugh, but he saw it
yes, from that day on there was a man in me whom i did not know
this very night, do you hear?
said gringoire, because she is my wife and i am her husband
the flames were stifled by bloodsoaked cloaks thrown over their faces from a distance

thus an immense mass, what the romans called insula, an island, of private dwellings, flanked to right and left by two blocks of palaces, one crowned by the louvre, the other by the tournelles, bordered on the north by a long belt of abbeys and cultivated enclosures, the whole amalgamated and fused as one watched; above these hundreds of buildings whose roofs of tiles and slates stood out against one another to form so many strange ridges and chains, the tattooed, embossed, guilloched steeples of the forty-four churches on the right bank; innumerable streets crisscrossing; bounded on one side by an enclosure of high walls with square towers (that of the university had round towers); on the other by the seine, which was intersected by bridges and bore a heavy traffic of boats: such was the town in the fifteenth century
that’s his whole court
he was counting on some event, something decisive and extraordinary
the soldiers took the money from the bags to pelt hanno with

the suffete ordered that thirty-two of the elephants should stand in the river a hundred paces further on, while the others, downstream, would stop the lines of men swept away by the current; and all of them, holding their weapons above their heads, crossed the macar as if between two walls
certainly at that moment he was even more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable, with his streaming, purple face, his distraught eye, his mouth frothing with rage and pain, his tongue half lolling out
at the end, beside a tall chimney breast emblazoned with coats of arms from top to bottom, in a sumptuous red velvet armchair, sat the dame de gondelaurier, whose number years were written no less clearly on her clothes than on her features
once up in the lofty cage of the bell chamber, quasimodo, sadly shaking his head, contemplated for a time the six bells there, as if bemoaning some alien intruder which had interposed itself in his heart between them and himself

clopin trouillefou preaches like our holy father the pope,  cried the emperor of galilee, smashing his pot to prop up his table
her eyes and her diamonds flashed; her polished nails were a continuation of the fine jewels on her fingers; the two clasps of her tunic raised her breasts a little and brought them closer together, and in his imagination he was lost in the narrow cleft between them, down which hung a thread holding an emerald plaque, which could be seen lower down under the violet gauze

the poet’s already ailing doublet gave its last gasp in the struggle
maître coppenole himself applauded; and clopin trouillefou, who had been a competitor, and goodness knows the intense degree of ugliness his face could attain, confessed himself beaten
we have come on a matter known to you… your son!
he thought of the unfortunate girl who had caused his ruin, and whom he had ruined
cried the wretched girl
this was not how he had hoped to return!
they want to hang you again
the zaïmph sparkled, covered with radiance
aren’t her hands just perfect?
i am racked by remorse and creditors
the priests of ceres, dressed in blue robes, had wisely stopped in the street of satheb, and were chanting in a low voice a thesmophorion in megarian dialect
her pure, rose-red lips were half smiling; her calm, innocent forehead was at times overclouded by her thoughts, like a mirror by a breath; and from her long, dark, lowered eyelashes shone a kind of ineffable light which gave her profile that ideal sweetness which raphael later found at the mystic point of intersection of virginity, maternity, and divinity
a skirt with variegated stripes, tight at the waist, hung down to her ankles, where two pewter rings clashed together
this central, generative church is a kind of chimera among the old churches of paris; it has the head of one, the limbs of another, the rear of a third; something of all of them
but instead of keeping his position to cover the infantry, narr’havas turned sharply to the right, as though he wanted to be crushed by hamilcar
this last of the barbarians represented to them all the barbarians, all the army; they avenged themselves on him for all their disasters, terrors, opprobrium

down with the chancellor of sainte-geneviève!
said salammbo: the spirit of the gods lives in sweet savours
beat swords, keep on beating!
mâtho, who could not understand such indifference, suspected the greek of having a genius he did not want to talk about
at this point jacques coictier, who had been unseated by the archdeacon’s fiery replies, put himself back in the saddle, and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one scholar correcting another: erras, amice claudi [you are mistaken, friend claude]
it’s in your interest that we thrash you, so as to harden you against beatings
and as she sat down, she gracefully held out her tambourine to the goat
he sat breathing heavily on the cushions, looking at her almost tenderly, as if he found in that sight some relaxation from his weariness
she cried, quite overcome
from the height at which he stood all the torches on their bronze stems seemed like a huge wreath of lights, set level with the floor; the black smoke which they gave off rose up into the darkness of the ceiling; and for some minutes the silence was so profound that the noise of the sea could be heard in the distance
it had at first been proposed that he should be flayed alive, that molten lead should be poured into his insides, that he should be starved to death; that he should be tied to a tree and that a monkey, behind him, should hit him on the head with a stone: he had offended tank, tank’s baboons would avenge her
he felt humiliated at having defended them; and as he could not avenge himself on the soldiers, or the elders, or on salammbo, or on anyone, and as his anger was looking for someone, at one blow he condemned all the garden slaves to the mines
what do i intend to do with it, august king of tunis?
between the rues saint-martin and saint-denis extended the enclosure of the trinité

spendius recognized them; he held back a cry
mâtho, like a drunken man, slept lying on his side, with one arm projecting over the edge of the couch
it was while he was still lying on a sickbed at the surgeon’s house that he had undergone the first interrogation of philippe lheulier and the official’s inquisition, which he had found very tiresome
here’s her shoe, all that i have left of her
finally they were allowed to go, and in a kind of homage to moloch or from some vague destructive urge, they tore down great cypresses in the temple woods, and lighting them from the cabiri’s torches, carried them through the streets singing
salammbo walked beneath it, slowly; then she crossed the terrace to go and sit at the back, on a kind of throne cut out of a turtle-shell
the doves seemed to be coming down towards the sea, gradually; then they disappeared as though swallowed up and falling of their own accord into the sun’s maw
you have come back to see us perish, haven’t you?
but if the siege of the towns was lifted, their inhabitants would come out, attack them from behind, and they would have the carthaginians in front of them
that’s no drink for january
human thought discovered a means of perpetuating itself not only more durable and more resistant than architecture, but simpler and easier
said the former slave, if your heart is bold, i will lead you into carthage
its huge muzzle drooped on to its chest, and its two forepaws, half concealed under its luxuriant mane, were widely separated like the wings of a bird
some of them kissed his hands; others, bowing low, came up to him to ask for orders; for now he was the real, sole leader of the barbarians; spendius, autharitus and narr’havas were discouraged, and he had shown such boldness and obstinacy that everyone obeyed him
[the abbot of saint-martin, that is the king of france, is by custom a canon and holds the minor prebend held by saint venantius and should sit in the treasurer’s seat]

at night the gates were closed, the river at each end of the town was barred with great iron chains, and paris slept peacefully
he found dom claude much changed, pale as a winter’s morning, hollow-eyed, hair almost white

all the hidden treasures in the louvre will melt away in such a blaze of expense!
the internal opening of these spouts was in the floor of the platform
i’m going to see it!
michelangelo, who already in the sixteenth century no doubt felt that it was dying, had one last idea, an idea born of despair

summon up your will and stop imploring the gods, for they do not turn aside for the cries of men!
i had my gold écu
mâtho facing him could find nothing to answer

they all rushed off to the maison-aux-piliers
every cathedral is a thousand million francs
they cried out for women
said the archdeacon, with a nod of his head
the barbarians could catch them up, crush them all
then a faint white curve showed up vaguely, and they found themselves on the bank of the macar
then he turned to his acolytes from the officiality: there at last justice is enlightened!
and the gilded chamber?
the barbarians broke through their lines; slaughtered them with their swords; they tripped over the dying and the dead, blinded by the blood spurting from their faces
the provinces quake at your fury, the furrows are full of corpses!
with one hand he seized hannibal, tore off with the other the edging of a garment lying about, bound his feet, his hands, stuffed the end into his mouth as a gag and hid him under the ox-hide bed, under a wide drapery hanging down to the floor
]’ then he began to sing, with a faraway look as if in ecstasy, in the tones of a canon chanting vespers: quae cantica!
the soldiers recognized this recumbent figure as the suffete hanno, the man who by his slowness had helped to lose the battle of the aegates islands; and as for his victory over the libyans at hecatompylus, if he had acted mercifully, it was out of greed, the barbarians thought, for he had sold all the captives on his own account, though he had declared their death to the republic
that does no one any harm, and it makes number deniers parisis for the matrons, who are poor women
his wild eye bore a singular expression; a look both enchanted and gentle
then they wandered round, lost in the complications of the architecture
it was a great purple litter, with bunches of ostrich feathers decorating the corners

the judge thought it had been answered, and continued:
cried the suffete; and through the smoke his eyes flashed like torches at this tall man who began to understand
a few students had stayed astride the window ledges and were looking out on to the place
from their gestures of mimicry, their roars of laughter, the banter and jeering cries they exchanged with one another from one end of the hall to the other, it was obvious that these young clerks did not share the boredom and weariness of those present, and knew very well how to turn the sight before their eyes into an entertainment for their private pleasure which gave them patience to wait for the other
and to you, gods hidden beneath the mountains and in the caverns of the earth!
needless to say, they picked up the money first, and the archdeacon followed them
he seemed stupefied by their daring; he called his captains
nego [i deny that],  retorted the advocate
the old louvre of philip-augustus, that building out of all proportion whose massive tower grouped around it twenty-three major towers, not counting turrets, seemed from a distance to be inset into the gothic rooftops of the hôtel d’alençon and the petit-bourbon
it did not matter that one did not worship the stars, believing certain constellations to be favourable or fatal, one still sacrificed to them; some unknown amulet, found by chance amid some danger, became a divinity; or it could be a name, merely a name, which one repeated without even trying to understand what it might mean
this great noise and great glare had drawn the barbarians to the foot of the walls; clinging to the wrecked helepolis to get a better view, they watched, aghast with horror
then using both hands she finished breaking and pushing clear the rusty stumps of the bars

the gate of malqua opened

he found the strength to look
what good are these old ones to me?
the moon herald who watched every night on top of eschmoûn’s temple, to give signals on his trumpet about the movements of the celestial body, noted one morning, over to the occident, something like a bird skimming the surface of the sea with its long wings
come to me, taanach, kroûm, ewa, micipsa, schaaoûl!
so saying, she turned round to phoebus
what is this then?
there was still a somewhat sulky tone in fleur-de-lys’s brief words
hamilcar went down the three steps; from a silver basin he took a llama skin floating in some black liquid
it caused, therefore, no little surprise and alarm when just as quasimodo, in this state of semi-intoxication, was passing triumphantly before the maison-aux-piliers, a man was seen suddenly to dart from the crowd, and with an angry gesture tear from quasimodo’s hands the gilded wooden crozier, emblem of his fools’ papacy
alas, no,  maître jacques replied, still smiling sadly
a poor man found her little golden cross hung on the stone cross in the field where they hold the fair
now i’m trembling and shivering, i’m failing at the decisive moment, i feel something supreme enfolding us, and i stammer
salammbo had parted the canvas, held it up at the end of her arm, and, without answering him, was looking in the direction of hamilcar
a child, i say!—a pretty little girl!—my agnés,  she went on, distraught, kissing some object in the shadows
don’t condemn us both
between these two patches of white, the left bank of the seine, at which he was gazing, thrust forth its dark mass, and dwindling steadily in perspective, plunged into the hazy horizon like a black arrow
more arrived every moment
he carried a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other
from his earliest steps among men he had felt, then seen himself the object of jeers, condemnation, rejection
he mended old breastplates
it was said that he had tasted successively all the apples from the tree of knowledge and, whether from hunger or disgust, had ended by biting the forbidden fruit
the vermilion on her lips made her teeth look whiter, and the antimony on her eyelids made her eyes look longer
spendius hesitated; he was trembling; finally, addressing the libyans, who were most numerous, he said:

and she began pacing up and down before the bars of her window, dishevelled, eyes blazing, banging her shoulder against the wall, with the wild look of a caged she-wolf which has long been hungry and feels feeding time draw near
the carts’ axles sometimes became caught in the streets; the devout would then profit from the opportunity to touch the baalim with their clothes, which they would subsequently keep as holy objects
they did not have beards, or hair, or eyebrows; in their hands, sparkling with rings, they carried immense lyres and they were all singing, in shrill voices, a hymn to the divinity of carthage

it opened on to a huge square, where a thousand scattered lights flickered in the hazy night fog
she had begun making blunders, and realized with terror that she was not saying what she should have said
she will give in!
finally the tumult died down and the soldiers went away to begin again
then he dived back under the twisting vault of the spiral staircase and went down again
he cherished them like parts of his own person, of his hatred, and it made his spirits rise, his arm feel stronger; all that had to be accomplished appeared clearly to him
have you seen her great eyes under the wide eyebrows, like twin suns beneath triumphal arches?
the canons of sainte-geneviève!
thus in france you can still read over the wicket of the seigneurial prison at tourville: sileto et spera [be silent and hope]; in ireland, under the shield placed on top of the main gate of the castle of fortescue: forte scutum, salus ducum [a strong shield, the safety of leaders]; in england, over the main entrance to the hospitable manor of the earls cowper: tuum est [it is yours]
the nomads’ wives swayed in their square, dun-coloured dresses of dromedary hair; musicians from cyrenaica, swathed in violet gauze and with painted eyebrows, sang squatting on rush mats; old negresses with pendulous breasts picked up for fuel animal droppings which they dried in the sun; syracusan women had gold plates in their hair, the lusitanians seashell necklaces, the gauls wolfskins on their white breasts; and sturdy children, verminous, naked, uncircumcised, butted passers-by in the stomach, or came up behind like tiger cubs to bite their hands
it was not death that made them go pale, but the horrible compulsion to which they were reduced
she had dragged herself along on her hands, then iron rings had cut into her ankles and there had been a clanking of chains
thunder rolled in the distance
the chief of perfumes admitted that he knew nothing about it, soldiers had arrived with knives, yelling: he had opened the boxes for them
a genius,  she went on, is driving me on to this love

then, the women of the neighbourhood would say, the whole church took on some element of the fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths opened here and there; you could hear barking from the stone dogs, wyverns, tarasques which keep watch day and night, neck outstretched and jaws open, round the monstrous cathedral; and if it was a christmas night, while the great bell seemed to growl as it summoned the faithful to the blazing lights of midnight mass, the atmosphere spread over the sombre façade was such that the great doorway seemed to be swallowing up the crowd and the rose-window watching it

revolt and brigandage have no part in apollo’s company

maître andry,  jehan went on, still hanging on to his capital, shut up, or i’ll drop on your head!
i’m going to tell you what up till now i hardly dared to tell myself when i furtively examined my conscience during those deep hours of the night when it is so dark that it seems as though god can no longer see us
she fell down in a faint
as if there were not enough misfortunes at the same time, it was learned that the mercenaries of sardinia had crucified their general, seized the fortresses and everywhere slaughtered men of canaanite race

he looked down on her trembling at his feet, he felt a kind of joy as he saw her suffer for his divinity, which he too could not completely embrace
claude’s compassion was increased by such ugliness; and he vowed inwardly to bring up this child for love of his brother, so that, whatever faults jehan might commit in the future, there should stand to his credit this act of charity, performed for his sake

my friends, i’d like someone to speak to me—the human voice comes as music to the human ear
seu de pellibus grisis fourratisl [or lined with grey fur!
if she were not hamilcar’s daughter…’
spendius envied his strength; but for the dispatch of spies, the choice of sentries, skill in using machines and all defensive means, mâtho listened docilely to his companion; and they no longer spoke of salammbo – the one did not think about it, the other was held back by a sense of shame
quasimodo would have needed only to stretch out his hand to haul him back from the gulf, but he simply did not look at him
and you enjoy that?
suddenly he straightened up and his whole body trembled

it was an angel!
pour out gold by the ton!
several abandoned their companions; they chose their army according as the fancy took them, and the gauls with autharitus went over to join the men from the cisalpine province whose language they understood

what can we do to rouse her?
this first enclosure contained a wood of plane-trees, as a precaution against plague and infection from the air
has the good god no pity?—oh!
and anyhow, i will soon know what you want from the movement of your lips and your eyes
now that their first joy was past they began to feel some anxiety
they waited for the thrice-holy feast when, from the top of a pyre, an eagle flew off into the sky, symbol of the year’s resurrection, the people’s message to their supreme baal, which they saw as a kind of union, a way of attaching themselves to the sun’s strength
spendius felt the ground and recognized that it was carefully carpeted with lynx-skins; then they seemed to feel a large damp, cold, slimy rope slide between their legs
all we have to do then is thrash you for a week
muttered gudule, rummage in your devilish amulet!
camp to recover the zaïmph!
a few ashes on the coals!

there he adjusted the noose

he also took from there the double ladder, which he set up right against the gibbet
the children sprawling about their legs would have scared a monkey
no’, coming after the oh!
do you know that my name is florian barbedienne, monsieur the provost’s own deputy, and, what is more, commissioner, investigator, comptroller and examiner with equal powers in the provostry, bailiwick, conservancy and presidial courts?

they had to be left outside
it was further remarked that for some little time his horror of gypsy women and zingari seemed to have intensified
yes, we have,  said maître jacques, rummaging in his wallet
mâtho commanded his companions with the iberians, the lusitanians, the men from the west, and from the islands, and all those who spoke greek had asked for spendius, because of his intelligence
at that, she emerged from the state of collapse into which she had fallen for a few moments, and cried out, and while she spoke her voice at one moment rent the ear like a saw, at the next stammered as if every possible malediction had crowded upon her lips to burst out simultaneously
come to me, my phoebus!
two other rows of smaller basins extended on each side in parallel
from time to time the priests plucked muffled chords on their lyres, and in the intervals of the music could be heard the faint sound of her golden chain and the regular clacking of her papyrus sandals
mâtho whipped the canvas aside
he stopped, the shadow stopped
cohorts of infantry appeared; they closed in; and at the same time all the others saw foot soldiers running up with galloping horsemen
from behind the old woman spat out a curse
mâtho cried out as if wounded by a sword
the greeks dug pits with their sword points
now i can crush men like cockleshells, i can throw myself at the phalanxes, brush aside the sarissae with my hands, stop stallions with my hand in their nostrils; even a catapult would not kill me!

what the cell contained nobody knew; but at night, from the shore by the terrain, there had often been seen, at a little window it had at the back of the tower, a strange, intermittent red glow, appearing, disappearing, reappearing at short, regular intervals, which seemed consistent with the puffing of a bellows and to come from a flame rather than a light
squatting in irregular groups they looked at each other in a daze and did not speak
instead of her sweet little agnès, so rosy and fresh, who was a gift from god, a kind of little monster, hideous, lame, one-eyed, misshapen, was dragging itself across the floor squawking
he even asked her whether, by chance, someone had not driven her into it; and, with a nod of her head, she answered no, so proud was salammbo of having saved the zaïmph
but what particularly drew the eye, and held it long fixed on that spot, was the abbey itself
the presence of that gibbet was enough to impart to all its surroundings the most sinister air

others walked right through the dishes on their crimson cloths and kicked to pieces the ivory stools and glass tyrian phials

it was an impenetrable place, communicating with the shore by a tunnel known only to him, and as he looked all round he took in a great draught of air
louis xi’s grave features contracted, but what could be seen of his emotion passed in a flash
he had no regrets, he was not sorry; all he had done, he was ready to do again; he would rather see her in the executioner’s hands than on the captain’s arm, but he was suffering; suffering so much at times that he tore out handfuls of hair to see whether it had gone white
so saying he held out his cutlass to the priest
gringoire shook his head

the student huddled under the furnace
this question brought a gleam of hope into jehan’s eyes
then the citizens of hippo-zarytus, on the pretext of an alarm, made hanno’s three hundred men go up on to their walls; then, coming up behind them, they suddenly took them by the legs and heaved them over the ramparts
scatterbrain,  muttered the archdeacon
it was like watching those young roman ladies who would amuse themselves by sticking gold pins into the breast of some beautiful slave girl
cried the suffete, what you don’t have on your face you must have on your shoulders!
although he was dying she saw him again in her tent, on his knees, with his arms around her waist, stammering gentle words; she yearned to feel those arms, hear those words again; she did not want him to die!
he has a fine beard!
very well,  said colombe, the goat must entertain us in its turn and do a miracle for us
and from his purplish lips escaped a breath more noisome than the stench of a corpse
you are very moving,  he said, wiping away a tear
and then, as he plunged further down the street, legless men, blind men, cripples, swarmed round him, and men with one arm, or with one eye, and lepers with their sores, some coming out of the houses, some from little side streets, some from the cellar openings, shouting, bellowing, yelping, all hobbling, bobbing along, hurrying towards the light, wallowing in the mire like slugs after rain
not one will be sold!
below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling away
three thousand feet of timber cut down at maschala, and at ubada granaries burst open and cisterns filled up!

suddenly, at the moment when the executioner’s assistants were preparing to carry out charmolue’s phlegmatic order, he climbed over the balustrade of the gallery, gripped the rope with feet, knees and hands, then they saw him slither down the façade, like a raindrop sliding along a window pane, run towards the two executioners as swiftly as a cat fallen from a roof, lay them low with his two huge fists, pick up the gypsy in one hand, like a child with its doll, and in a single bound leap back into the church, lifting the girl over his head and crying in a formidable voice: asylum!
what do you want with my religion?
besides, now full of hate, they naively turned to moloch the killer, and all abandoned tanit
which has expressed, not only its literary and scholastic obsessions, but its vast, deep, universal movement?
he said to a slave who stood writing in the hollow of his hand
in egypt he would have been taken for the temple’s god; the middle ages thought he was its demon; he was its soul
it’s the devil who made them in the image of his fork!
look at you weeping like a coward!
it sometimes happened that a solemn decree of parliament violated the asylum and delivered the condemned back to the executioner; but that was rare
spendius urged them to give in
my lord,  he said returning to the provost, which one am i to take?
this tower was the most lively, and thus the most hideous, spot in the truanderie
to obey you i would go down through the cave of hadrumetum into the kingdom of the shades… forgive me!

now,  clopin trouillefou went on, as soon as i clap my hands, andry-le-rouge, you push the stool over with your knee; françois chante-prune, you hang on to the rogue’s feet; and you, bellevigne, jump on his shoulders; all at the same time, do you hear?
his face was convulsed by unspeakable anguish, and he was choking as he held back his sobs, he wanted so much both to ask questions and cry mercy!

narr’havas was the finest of them all; straps studded with pearls clasped his slim arms; the golden circle which fastened his long garment round his head held an ostrich feather which hung down behind his shoulder; a continual smile revealed his teeth; his eyes seemed as sharp as arrows, and in all his person there was something alert and nimble
she had a he-goat with her, a big one, black or white, i forget now
anyone who has ever tossed a stone into a pond full of frogs or fired a gun at a flock of birds can imagine the effect of such unseemly words when the attention of all was fixed elsewhere
go back to carthage!
the king sprang outside and called his horsemen
as he could no longer sit, he remained lying by the door, half hidden in the fringes of the high tapestry; and when the pontiff of moloch asked them if they would agree to giving up their children, his voice, suddenly, boomed out from the shadows like a genius bellowing from the depths of a cave
men bent over a windlass; the great beam rose, became horizontal, rose up almost vertically, and, overloaded at the end, bent like a huge reed
the palais of the légion d’honneur is also a most distinguished piece of confectionery
the heavy surbased arches of monsieur de brosse, the clumsy architect of the portail saint-gervais, so much for art; and as for history, we have the garrulous memories of the great pillar, still echoing with the patrus’ gossip
with what thoughts did the unfortunate man wrestle?
but they caught sight of a small lake, divided into a number of pools by blue stone walls
the orator delivered it with a marvellous range of actions
my name is tristan l’hermite and i’m the king’s compère

why do they call you la esmeralda?
even poor poetry, properly so-called, that which went on obstinately vegetating in manuscripts, found itself obliged, if it were to count for something, to become incorporated into the framework of the building in the form of hymn or prose sequence; that after all was the role played by aeschylus’ tragedies in the religious festivals of greece, by the book of genesis in solomon’s temple
suddenly a long arrow whistled, then another, and stones thudded: but the ill aimed shots (for they were afraid of hitting the zaïmph) passed over his head

streets emptied at his approach, and this torrent of men in flight burst up on either side up to the tops of the walls
a little further away there was a food-warmer, and a prie-dieu in crimson velvet, set off with small gold studs; finally, at the far end, a simple bed of pink and yellow damask, with no tinsel or braid; the fringes quite plain

he was unable to conceal his delight, though he tried from time to time to compose himself
gringoire, who had not yet quite reached that state, half rose
hamilcar interrogated the chief of the ships
his harangue went on for seven hours
exclaimed gringoire, there’s a great king!

thus, having duly ruminated over quasimodo’s case, he threw back his head and half closed his eyes, to appear more majestic and impartial, with the result that at that moment he was at once deaf and blind—twin conditions without which no judge is perfect
hamilcar meanwhile was ranging over the eastern territories
i am teaching him to hurl javelins and drive teams of horses
what is certain is that they are gypsies
what was that inner fire which sometimes flashed in his eyes, so much so that they looked like holes pierced in a furnace wall?
what difference does it make to you, your majesty, by whom every eye is dazzled, that there should be one more poor man on earth?
he ran to it as to a star
taanach, with a smile like an old monkey’s grimace, went back to her task
that is indeed a frightful story,  said oudarde, enough to make a burgundian weep!
at the sight of that ugly face appearing in the middle of her song, the girl broke off with an involuntary gesture of fright

quasimodo, remaining on his own in the vastness of notre-dame, a moment before under such tumultuous siege, made his way back to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many weeks with him as her guard
mâtho the libyan leaned towards her
mâtho, as he walked ahead of her, drove them aside with a gesture of his arm which lifted his red cloak
and many people simply preferred to see them living, breathing, moving, jostling, in flesh and blood, in this flemish embassy, this episcopal court, in the cardinal’s robes, in coppenole’s jerkin, rather than painted and dressed up, speaking in verse and, so to speak, stuffed like dummies beneath the yellow and white tunics in which gringoire had rigged them up

she repeated her question
first of all she said more than a year,  observed the soldier
the man with the lantern walked straight to the tip of the terrain
whatever is without beauty is wrong to exist,
and that all came from quasimodo

the vertical section of this kennel, as phoebus had so aptly described it, would have made a triangle
i have not crawled on my belly for so long with my nails in the earth through the cavern’s countless ramifications without glimpsing far ahead, at the end of the dark tunnel, a light, a flame, something, no doubt a reflection from the dazzling central laboratory where wise and patient men have caught god unawares
there are indeed some quite superb high-warp tapestries there
and ate her with their teeth
these places of asylum, amid the deluge of penal laws and barbaric jurisdictions which flooded the city, were like islands rising above the level of human justice

hippocrates, a dream, urania, a dream, hermes, an idea
she turned round, begging him with a smile: please leave me alone, phoebus!
you demanded horses, women, land, judicial office, no doubt, and priesthood!
comrade, is there any reason, because you bored us this morning, for not hanging you this evening?
then he began to run over the platform from end to end – and like a charioteer triumphing in the olympic games, spendius, exultant with pride, lifted up his arms
it was a large dogheaded ape, one of those which lived freely in the goddess’s enclosure
that did not stop quasimodo reappearing from time to time those first few days
he kept seeing, prowling ceaselessly around the church, sinister-looking men who never took their eyes off the girl’s place of refuge
he dismounted from his horse; and spurring it on the rump with the sword in his hand sent it into the barbarians
several people fainted; others became inert and petrified in their ecstasy
she nodded assent and said: yes
and leaning over the balcony balustrade he began shouting: little girl!
the court of miracles lay in total darkness
he went on still louder: mademoiselle esmeralda!
but then came the crusades
it is certain that if ravaillac had not assassinated henri iv there would have been no documents from ravaillac’s trial to be deposited in the registry of the palais de justice; no accomplices with an interest in making the said documents disappear; hence no arsonists obliged, for want of any better method, to burn down the registry in order to burn the documents and to burn down the palais de justice in order to burn the registry; in short, therefore, no great fire in number the old palais would still be standing with its old great hall; i could say to the reader go and see it’, and we should both be spared the trouble, i of composing, he of reading, any detailed description of it
it occurred to her that someone might hear; so she fell silent

the captains, in their bronze buskins, had occupied the central path, under a purple, gold-fringed awning, which stretched from the stable wall to the first terrace of the palace; the bulk of the soldiers were spread out under the trees, where numerous flat-roofed buildings could be seen, presses, cellars, stores, bakeries, and arsenals, with a yard for the elephants, pits for the wild beasts, a prison for the slaves
these pillars were arranged in such a way as to reproduce in their circular rows, one inside another, the saturnian period containing the years, the years the months, the months the days, and finally met against the wall of the sanctuary

under clumps of turpentine-trees could be seen little buildings of varying shapes
his deputies for civil, criminal, and private cases were doing his job for him, as was customary, and since eight o’clock in the morning some scores of townsfolk, men and women, packed and squashed in a dark corner of the lower court of the châtelet, between a stout oak barrier and the wall, had been blissfully looking at the varied and delightful spectacle of civil and criminal justice being dispensed by maître florian barbedienne, auditor at the châtelet, deputy to monsieur the provost, a little confusedly and quite at random
hamilcar looked at giddenem; he wanted to strangle him
suddenly, as they were all grouping together round the battering ram for a final effort, each man holding his breath and flexing his muscles so as to lend his whole strength to the decisive blow, a screaming even more awful than that which had broken out and then expired beneath the beam, went up from their midst
exclaimed salammbo, you will never wipe out what is irreparable!
they dragged him off
perhaps the others are stronger?

so, gringoire, you have never felt envious of those handsome lads in their military actons?
people looked like corpses as they slept
so here i am then in actor’s garb, like saint genestus

for making a great new wooden cage with big joists, ribs and string-pieces, number feet long by number feet broad, number feet high between the boards, smoothed and bolted with large iron bolts, which has been installed in a room, belonging to one of the towers of the fortress of saint-antoine, in the which cage is kept and detained, by command of our lord the king, a prisoner who lived previously in an old, worn-out and decrepit cage—in the making of the said new cage there have been used number horizontal joists and number upright ones, number string pieces number wises long; and number carpenters have been employed in squaring, working, and shaping all the aforesaid wood in the yard of the bastille for twenty days …’

everyone wanted a better view of him

sometimes he broke off, uttered a harsh, guttural cry; mâtho’s mule increased its speed; the others hurried to catch them up, then spendius began again, always torn by his anguish
drunkards carried off wineskins, those greedy for food took hunks of meat, cakes, fruit, butter wrapped in fig leaves, snow in linen bags
the priest had remained motionless, finger still pointing at the gibbet, holding his gesture, like a statue
i’ll take you to see the lions of the hôtel du roi; they’re wild animals

quasimodo hurried to that tower

the witch didn’t escape by the rue du mouton

an immense clamour came vaguely to him and lying on his back he looked up at the stars

i had to stay to the end
thus a lot of men disbanded themselves and roamed over the countryside
he had judged that it must come directly towards him, against the most invulnerable part of the wall, which for that very reason, was short of sentries
they were our brothers!
the women made loud protests at this decision; they coveted the punic ladies’ jewels
bellevigne de l’étoile, andry le rouge, fraçois chante-prune came closer to gringoire
in the mornings he hid in caves; in the evening he started off again, with his wounds bleeding, starving, sick, living on roots and carrion; at last one day he saw lances on the horizon and followed them, for his reason was disturbed by terror and privation
is it not enough that all my property has been given to my judges, my plate to monsieur de torcy, my library to maître pierre doriolle, my tapestry to the governor of roussillon?
today there remains only one quite imperceptible trace of the place de grève as it then existed
the zaïmph fell down, covered her; she saw mâtho’s face bending over her breast
clopin stamped his foot
that damned perrette callebotte!
however, the peculiarly high and steeply pitched roof of the modern palace, bristling with carved gargoyles, covered in lead sheets over which glittering incrustations of gilded copper twisted in a thousand fantastic arabesques, this oddly damascened roof sprang gracefully from amid the brown ruins of the ancient building, whose massive old towers, bulging with the years like casks collapsing with age and splitting from top to bottom, looked like fat bellies released from the support of buttons
he had just wet his lips at the goblet, and spat the liquid out again, saying: ugh!
it will be lovelier still today,  their interlocutor finally put in, his patience apparently tried as he listened to them
the danger was imminent and a decision urgent
she embraced his knees
quite so,  answered gringoire
he sent out zarxas to mâtho, went through the woods, rallied his men (losses had not been heavy) – and furious at having been beaten in battle, they reformed their lines, when someone discovered a vat of paraffin, no doubt abandoned by the carthaginians
when i had seen you twice, i wanted to see you a thousand times, i wanted to see you always
the goat skipped after them, so happy to see gringoire again that she kept making him stumble by sticking her horns between his legs
i protest that it was not i who wrote that to my lord of guyenne, but monsieur the cardinal balue!
three times a month they had their beds set up on the high terrace bordering the wall of the courtyard: and from below one could see them at open air tables, without boots or cloaks, with diamonds on their fingers as they prodded the food and their great earrings leaning against the pitchers – all big and fat, half naked, happy, laughing and eating under the blue sky, like great sharks playing in the sea
she opened her mouth to answer
but next to him was a figure dressed in black and veiled from head to foot who struck her dumb
his sword rose and fell
i tell you she’s my daughter!
the unhoped-for testimony of the archer put new spirit into the recluse for whom this interrogation was like crossing over an abyss on a knife-edge
how could anyone imagine,  continued dom claude, that every beam from a star is a thread attached to a man’s head?
he tried some other questions but she barely answered
he was seen, and a clamour arose
his army amounted to , men, about twice as many as the barbarian army
what is death, when you come down to it?
they went on a few steps, and the temple façade spread before them
his eminence’s entrance had a shattering effect on the audience
it was obvious that everything in her was shattered
there is noah’s misadventure carved in explicit detail, as in the great doorway at bourges
the first had a big, stupid face, drunk and dumbfounded
hamilcar was counting with the beads; they rattled under his fingers
hamilcar, back at last with salammbo, untied hannibal
she had drawn back into a corner; but she took a step towards him, and stretching out her bare arm:
from the movement of her lips quasimodo thought she was sending him off: so he stood up and limped away, slowly, hanging his head, not even daring to look up at the girl with his eye full of despair
the feathered bolt whistled and stuck in the hunchback’s left arm
his head was on fire
i ask you, oudarde, putting the devil with the foundlings!
a poor old woman now, but used to be a pretty girl, my lords
and there was i thinking it was all to do with the bailiff!
the girls laugh at me
landlady, my love, some other wine!
some devout men had at first tried to count them, to see if their number corresponded to the days of the solar year; but others were added and it was impossible to distinguish them in the dizzy movement of the horrible arms
the same silence as before
the little island appeared in the shadows like a dark mass on the far side of the pale strip of water separating him from it
every toad that is baptized should be dressed in red or black velvet, with a little bell round its neck and another on its feet
she told how he climbed the mountains of ersiphonia, of the journey to tartessus, and the war against masisabal to avenge the serpent queen:
but vague ruins, heaps of black earth, gardens made darker masses in the shadows, and down in malqua fishing nets stretched from one house to another, like gigantic bats spreading their wings
it is never more solid than when it lacks all reason
they looked like two statues facing each other
this something, or rather someone, was a blind man, a little blind man with a bearded jewish face, who, as he swept the area round him with a stick, with a big dog towing him along, said in a nasal hungarian accent: facitote caritatem!
just remember: when she appeared, how all the torches paled
you cannot imagine his joy on the days of a full peal
the forty-two colleges were distributed fairly evenly, and were to be found everywhere; the varied and amusing summits of these fine buildings were products of the same art as the simple roofs they dominated, and amounted to no more than the same geometrical figure multiplied by its square or its cube
from inside the wall a throaty laugh responded to these bloodthirsty words
the state of that soul, the habits it had contracted, the shape it had taken beneath that constricting envelope, leading so unsociable a life, such questions would be hard to determine
with considerable difficulty he was torn away from this contemplation, but at last he turned round, and at a sign from him two men in yellow, the executioner’s assistants, came up to the gypsy to fasten her hands again
if utica alone were captured, hippo-zarytus, six hours further along the coast, would replace it, and the metropolis, thus provisioned, would prove impregnable
the archdeacon returned to his cell dumbfounded, finally realizing the identity of compère tourangeau, and recalling this passage from the cartulary of saint-martin of tours:
during the night following la esmeralda’s execution, the executioner’s men had taken down her body from the gibbet and carried it, according to custom, into the cellar at montfaucon
he put a hand on the arrow, tore it from his arm, and calmly snapped it over his huge knee
but their position made them indispensable
or on your knees,  said rym
it was mere chance that he was at the feast – his father had made him live in the barca household, according to the custom of kings who sent their children to stay with the families of the great in order to prepare marriages; but in the six months that narr’havas had been there, he had not yet seen salammbo; and, squatting on his heels, beard bent over the shafts of his javelins, he watched her, with nostrils flaring, like a leopard crouched in bamboo
the palais bailiff is obliged to deliver the malefactor after sentence to be executed, if it’s a lay person to the provost of paris; if a clerk, to the bishop’s official
isn’t it so, master?
he went off immediately to the western provinces, to take his revenge in the very places which had seen his shame
at regular intervals they came upon small square temples, used as stages for the pilgrims going to sicca
what would the throne of france mean to me when i could rebuild the empire of the orient!
it was truly a sight worthy of a more intelligent spectator than phoebus to see how these lovely girls, with their poisonous, angry tongues, coiled, slithered, and twisted round the street dancer
then, suddenly, narr’havas marched resolutely towards a sentry
the abbadirs, stones which had fallen from the moon, swung in slings of silver wire; little loaves, in the shape of a woman’s sex, were borne on baskets by the priests of ceres; others brought their fetishes, and their amulets; forgotten idols reappeared; and the mystic symbols had even been taken from the ships, as though carthage wanted to give herself up totally to thoughts of death and desolation
nothing makes a man more adventurous than an empty feeling behind his waistband
so they freed themselves, threw off the yoke of architecture and each went its own way
he demanded prerogatives for his men and set them up in important posts; and the barbarians all looked wide-eyed when they saw the numidians on the towers
what must one be to please you?
then jehan had hidden himself behind one of the stone kings, not daring to breathe, staring at the monstrous hunchback with a look of terror, like the man who, paying court to the wife of a menagerie keeper, went one night to keep a tryst, climbed over the wrong wall and suddenly found himself confronting a polar bear
let’s bet those are pebbles!
baal-samin, god of the heavenly spaces; baal-peor, god of the sacred mountains; baal-zebub, god of corruption, and those of neighbouring countries and related races: the iarbal of libya, the aldrammelech of chaldea, the kijun of the syrians; derceto, virgin faced, crawled on her fins, and tammouz’ corpse was drawn on the middle of a catafalque, among torches and shorn hair
you hide your sorrows from me, you despise your old nurse!
cried the girl, burying her face in her hands
all around him was stone; before his eyes the gaping monsters; below, at the very bottom, in the square, the pavement; above his head quasimodo weeping
the recluse did not stir
hamilcar, carried away by some spirit, continued, standing on the topmost step of the altar, quivering, terrible; he raised his arms, and the rays from the candelabra burning behind him, shone through his fingers like golden spears
he went out into the fields to gather herbs for the sick
come on,  he said between his teeth, on our way!
that gave me something to think about
her teeming crowds are as though lost in the dust of your sandals, and all its treasures, together with the provinces, the fleets and the islands do not move me with desire like the coolness of your lips and the curve of your shoulders
let them talk, little girl!
quasimodo gasped for the third time
the slave said to him
the mighty city had burst successively four rings of walls like a growing child splitting its last year’s clothes
besides mâtho, who was a brave man, would not abandon them
surprised, intoxicated, spellbound, i let myself go on looking at you
it looked like a veil hiding your face; you looked through at me; your memory was mingled with its rays; i could no longer distinguish between the two of you!
he said; i was forgetting … it’s our custom not to hang a man without asking if there’s a woman who wants him
then he prostrated himself in sign of slavery, and as evidence of his loyalty recalled all his behaviour since the beginning of the war
the night before, as a precaution, they had made a wide detour
i can tell you, i gave the carter a piece of my mind!
they all had rights over the public highway
she no longer had any hope, she no longer knew what she wanted, but she did not want them to take her daughter away from her
april turns her back on january
the gypsy crouched down on her knees, and rested the goat’s head against her cheek as it caressed her
hamilcar listened hard for a few minutes, still afraid of seeing them return
the moon glided between two clouds
there was some booing, for the tyranny of the male principle prevailed that day in the consciousness of all, and the goddess had even been forgotten to such an extent that the absence of her pontiffs had passed unnoticed
the idea of yet again losing life, hope, phoebus, whom she still glimpsed in her future, the absolute void in which her weakness left her, all escape cut off, unsupported, abandoned, isolated, all these thoughts and countless others overwhelmed her
went on fleur-de-lys; don’t you remember?
that of charles iv?
taanach lit in the corners of the apartment four tripods full of strobus and cardamom; then she unfolded some big babylonian tapestries and stretched them on cords all round the room, for salammbo did not want to be seen, even by the walls
it was in fact the king’s troops arriving
the veil itself is divine, because it is part of her
the space that the barbarians had in front of them, full of swirling confusion, drew them on like a whirlpool; some threw themselves in
i had a child!
the hall was spacious and gloomy, which made it look all the more spacious
then mâtho, frightened by the silence, said to spendius:
gradually the flood of houses, constantly driven outwards from the heart of the town, overflowed this enclosure, eroded it, wore it down, erased it
his immobility had something of the hawk who has just discovered a sparrows’ nest and is watching it
a street opened in front of him; he found it so dark and deserted that he hoped to escape there from all the echoes and illuminations of the festival
bring in the others!
he had sat down again, in gloomy silence, in his big armchair, his elbow back in its usual position on the table, his forehead against his hand
then, advancing with great care, they felt the wall to find a way out
the eunuchs, the slaves, the women had been carefully removed; no one could know the mystery that was being prepared
muttered maître andry musnier
at the hôtel saint-pol you will find forty archers of monsieur the dauphin’s new guard, take them; and with all those men hasten to notre-dame
then the church could be seen in all its length, stretching into the deep interior, dark, hung with mourning, dimly lit by a few candles twinkling in the distance on the high altar, opening like a cave mouth in the middle of a square filled with dazzling light
he had acquired the general viciousness
they implored him; and as the word treachery’ began to recur in their speeches he lost his temper
here’s one,  said the archdeacon
i do not believe in medicine
gringoire gave a start
nothing,  phoebus answered
the young lady appeared to be begging the officer to make no further demands on her
he paused once more, then continued:
he took the cup and was raising it to his lips when a gaul, the same one whom gisco had wounded, clapped him on the shoulder, jovially uttering jesting remarks in his native tongue
some could be seen climbing up and down the two stairways connecting storeys
if we were not in the fifteenth century, we should say that gringoire had descended from michelangelo to callot
some who did not die were pursued and went to drown in the sea
they asked for anything they found beautiful: a ring, a belt, sandals, the fringe of a dress, and when the denuded carthaginian cried: but i have nothing else
the night, as already mentioned, was extremely dark
the young cavalier wore the dazzling uniform of captain of archers of the ordinance of the king, much too closely resembling jupiter’s costume, which the reader has already been able to admire in the opening book of this story, for us to inflict on him a second description
a yellow wax candle lit up this scene of voracity and reflection
his jehan, his beloved brother, his spoilt child, came to his door more than once, knocked, swore, said a dozen times who he was
if you knew how pretty you were at four months!
the ladder, hurled backwards, for an instant stayed straight and upright, seemed to waver, swayed, then suddenly, describing a terrifying arc number feet in radius, crashed down on the pavement with its load of bandits more swiftly than a drawbridge when its chains snap
they lived, these people, without employment, far from the apartments, slept at night in the gardens, ate up the kitchen scraps – a human mildew sprouting in the shadow of the palace
the moment she saw what was inside, a profound pity was depicted on all her features, and her cheerful, open face changed expression and colour as abruptly as if it had gone from sunshine to moonlight
quasimodo had stopped beneath the great portal
they are to be found in every age, always the same, that is always in tune with the age
three sorts of damage can be distinguished on the ruins, and they all affect it at different depths: first is time, which has chipped it away imperceptibly here and there and left rust all over its surface; then political and religious revolutions which, blind and angry by their very nature, have hurled themselves upon it in tumult, rent its rich array of sculptures and carvings, smashed its rose-windows, broken its necklaces of arabesques and figurines, torn down its statues, sometimes for wearing a mitre, sometimes a crown; finally fashions, increasingly silly and absurd, which after the splendidly anarchic deviations of the renaissance, have succeeded one another in the inevitable decline of architecture
now we have observed that judges generally arrange things so that the day when they are sitting is also the day when they are in a bad temper, in order always to have someone on whom to vent their spleen conveniently, in the name of the king, the law, and justice
wait,  she said
then the suflete’s slaves went forward to look for the markers which, on his orders had been placed at intervals
claude put him out to nurse
it reappeared on the first floor
the king of france himself, for knocking thoughtlessly one evening on the thaumaturge’s door, sank up to his knees into his own paris pavement—that happened less than three hundred years ago
they came to an oval opening, protected by a gate
why didn’t i think of it before?
some had squeezed between the stones; other, bolder ones, had let themselves down with ropes
she was subjugated, quivering, shattered, in his arms, at his mercy
i want to go away!
rumble grève, bay grève!
he preened himself as he replied: it’s a latin word meaning sun
phoebus was no longer there
from the end of the fifteenth century it was encroached upon, superseded, and the suburbs ran still further out
clopin climbed on to a big stone
no, no, i won’t listen
take that off,  mâtho told him, i know that you are a brave man!
the priests of khamon, in fawn woollen robes, lined up in front of their temple, under the columns of the portico; those of eschmoûn, in linen mantles, with coucoupha-headed necklets and pointed tiaras, took up position on the steps of the acropolis; the priests of melkarth, in violet tunics, took up the western side; the priests of the abbadirs, tightly wrapped in bands of phrygian stuff, placed themselves to the east; and on the southern side were drawn up, with the necromancers tattooed all over, the ranters in the patched cloaks, the attendants of the pataeci gods and the yidonim, who foretold the future by putting in their mouths a bone from a corpse
the people are trying to recover her by force
he raised his cap again, and went on still musing, with the look and tone of a huntsman urging on and launching his pack: good!
but that’s no distance, sir
i am the son of an impoverished family, my dear fellow
then the king dismissed rym and coppenole with a gesture: god keep you, messieurs, my good friends the flemings
he speaks when he wants to,  said the old woman
then the sun rose; it struck at the back of her head and she involuntarily became a little drowsy
whence the prodigious external variety of these buildings where so much order and unity are essentially lodged
they choked men with their trunks, or tore them from the ground and delivered them to the soldiers in the towers; they used their tusks to disembowel them, and threw them up into the air, so that long entrails hung round their ivory teeth like bundles of rigging on a mast
gringoire was more dead than alive
his foot struck a sword
women and children went to collect stones on the shore, picked up earth in their hands and brought it to the soldiers
the dying could be seen writhing, half charred to ashes, roaring with pain
interfacings, lozenges, lines of pearls alternated on the walls, and a railing of silver filigree formed a wide semi-circle in front of the bronze stairway coming down from the vestibule
it was indeed the king’s doctor, a man of about number, whose hard features were tempered only by his crafty look
narr’havas had already let loose his cavalry; the barbarians all threw themselves on the ground face downwards; then when the horses were three paces away, they leaped up under their bellies and slashed them open with a dagger thrust; half the numidians had perished when barca arrived
sometimes a group of squalid old women, spread out squatting over the steps of some shady porch, loudly grumbling as the archdeacon and bell-ringer went by, and mumbling their malice with some such encouraging welcome as: hm!
he had sent narr’havas to carthage to bring news of the victory; and the numidian king, proud of his success, presented himself to salammbo
i nunc, anima anceps, et sit tibi deus misericors!
the archdeacon, as though waking up with a start, held back his arm with convulsive violence
one must take what comes
i’ll have him buckled back on the leather bed when i get back
forgive me then this time, our lady of paris
however, gervaise spoke to her: and did they ever find out what became of la chantefleurie?
the gods execrate her!
they turned through narrow streets, amidst the darkness
after a moment’s pause: forward, lads!
later, at sicca, i made them all furious with fear of the republic!
just as you like,  replied the neighbour
i thank you, monsieur
what are you saying?
most of them did not even know what they wanted
at your service,  said the captain
she had missed nothing of the scene between gudule and tristan, and each of her mother’s fits of anguish had found an echo in her
what a memory the good lady has for bygone things!
a roar of laughter from all the students greeted the unfortunate name of the poor skinner-furrier of the king’s wardrobe
but his mind working as lucidly as in the heat of battle, he recalled hundreds of odious things, ignominies from which he had turned aside; and in the fire of his anger, as in the lightning of a storm, he saw in a flash all his disasters simultaneously
it was the poor goat, the agile djali, who had escaped after her, just as quasimodo was scattering charmolue’s brigade, and who had been lavishing caresses on her feet for the best part of an hour without being able to get so much as a glance from her
his eyes followed her every movement; it was his last ray of hope
they were already surrounded
it was like a cabirus’s joy; and the great rays of light striking his face seemed to him like the end of an invisible network which spanned abysses to attach him to the centre of the world
well said, upon my soul!
they were unsure, disconcerted as the barbarians always were at being confronted with walls
the cloister door was closed
now it was the priest who was threatening, quasimodo who was begging
and then i’m like the maréchal de gié at the siege of pontoise, my right is resting on a little bulge in the contours
the unanimous testimony of the men of the watch confirmed the old sergeant’s words for the provost
but now he seemed at once calmer and deadlier; an arrogant will flashed in his eyes, like the flame of a sacrifice
on the left, right down below, the canals of megara began to wind their white coils across the greenery of the gardens
the individual who had thus screwed a whole panoply on to his body was so completely hidden beneath his battle order that nothing could be seen of him but an impudent, snub, red nose, a lock of fair hair, a pink mouth and bold eyes
it is the goddess’s mantle!
this perhaps’, so dear to philosophers, emboldened gringoire
he liked to compare himself to mahomet’s tomb, attracted in opposite directions by two lodestones, eternally hesitating between high and low, ceiling and floor, falling and rising, zenith and nadir
the old slave seemed to know the danger that was alarming hamilcar, and went on:
they had carried ancestors about, triumphed in wars, and were worshipped as favourites of the sun
these turned round and ran straight at the carthaginians: they overturned, then crushed them underfoot, and driving them back like this came up to hanno’s tent, where he was at that moment with thirty carthaginians, the most illustrious of the elders
they hurried down the tower stairs, crossed the church, all dark and lonely, but echoing with the uproar, which made a dreadful contrast, and came out into the cloister garth by the red door
do you know where you are going?
look,  he said in an undertone to his companion, robert poussepain, who sniggered beside him as he gave a commentary on the scenes being enacted before their eyes, there’s jehanneton du buisson, the pretty daughter of that idle dog at the marché neuf
spendius had recovered his courage
an old man with a child was there, in the courtyard, and wanted to see the suffete
however utica and hippo-zarytus were free, since the mercenaries had lifted their siege
the women showed the small children their fine robes hanging in tatters on their emaciated limbs
associated with each of these typical monuments by similarity of style, manner, and attitude are a certain number of houses scattered through different districts, which the connoisseur’s eye can easily pick out and date
an individual, who stood within the balustrade in the space left clear round the marble table, had so far gone unnoticed, so completely was his long, slender person protected from every line of sight by the diameter of the pillar on which he was leaning
it was the agreed signal from the priest to the executioner
we were kind enough to change your name from le mauvais [the bad], which is too much like your appearance
they had believed phoebus to be dead, and there was no more to be said
the girl said tenderly
he stuck his hand in his pocket in such a daze that she stopped
so communication between him and them had been rapid, electric, and, so to speak, on an equal footing
maître andry looked up, seemed for a moment to be gauging the height of the pillar, the weight of the young rascal, mentally multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity, and shut up
he drank a long draught
the city, then, first struck the eye with its stern to the east and its prow to the west
a pretty woman, upon my word—and who must love me madly to have taken me as she did
after a second attempt, it was explained that the cups were locked up in a temple
clopin trouillefou, having arrived before the lofty portal of notre-dame, had indeed formed his troops into battle order
from that moment on maître coppenole enjoyed in paris, as he did in ghent, high esteem with the people; for men of such stature do so,  says philippe de commines, when they are thus unruly
it is not unusual for the weariness caused by extreme grief to have this effect on the mind
a breach opened in it
but for the fiery blush on her cheeks, seeing her thus silent and motionless, one would have taken her for a statue of modesty
spendius understood that he was full of immense anxiety; he did not dare say any more

buildings belonging exclusively to one of these three strata are perfectly distinct, unified, and complete
kiss me, foolish girl!
plunder them, hang them, sack them!
no, phoebus, no, i’ll be your mistress, for your amusement, pleasure, whenever you like, a girl who’ll be yours, that’s all i was made for, soiled, despised, dishonoured, but, what of it?—loved
thus, to sum up what we have said so far in an inevitably incomplete and abbreviated form, mankind has two books, two records, two testaments: masonry and printing, the stone bible and the paper bible

camp followers with slings were spaced out on the flanks
she’s our sister;—we must get her out of there
they spread out in a long straight line, which overlapped the wings of the punic army in order to envelop it completely
the day a woman spurned such a love i should have thought the mountains would move
taking excessive precautions he now went on foot, near her and between the two horses; and he kept whipping them with the end of a leather thong rolled round his arm, or took from a bag hanging on his chest balls of wheat, dates and yolk of egg, wrapped in lotus leaves, which he offered to salammbo, without speaking, as he ran along
jehan interrupted, i’d like to be the demon sidragasum
spendius talked to him of his journeys, of the peoples and temples he had visited, and he knew a great deal: he could make sandals, spears, nets, tame wild beasts, and cook fish
she turned on her heels, right and left at random, looking for a ladder, a rope, a stone, something to help her
next to it, the enormous towers of notre-dame, seen thus from behind with the long nave over which they rise, silhouetted in black against the vast, red glow filling the parvis, looked like the two gigantic firedogs of a cyclopean fire
it was a squadron of the king’s troop on counter-patrol by order of robert d’estouteville, keeper of the provostry of paris
it is certain that this monastery, of imposing appearance both as a church and as a manorial seat, this abbatial palace, where the bishops of paris counted themselves lucky to spend even one night, this refectory on which the architect had conferred the appearance, the beauty, and the splendid rose-window of a cathedral, this elegant lady chapel, this monumental dormitory, vast gardens, portcullis, drawbridge, enveloping battlements, cutting out notches from the view of the green meadows around them, courtyards where men in shining armour mingled with gold copes, all grouped and gathered round the three tall romanesque spires set firmly on a gothic apse, made an altogether magnificent figure on the horizon
this flight from nature, life, himself, mankind, god, from everything, lasted all day
just look at that face!
at the idea of clasping her in my arms a frenzy of joy seizes me, and yet i hate her, spendius!
but there were nasty rumours going round about them stealing children and cutting purses and eating human flesh
then he slumped so low over the chair and table that jehan could not see him behind the huge chair-back
he’s probably dead,  someone replied
she said that the schalischim looked furious, that he had shouted a lot, had then fallen asleep
king of the two zones, self-begetting creator, father and mother, father and son, god and goddess, goddess and god!
cried the people for their part, and this immense acclamation could be heard on the opposite bank of the seine, amazing the crowd on the grève and the recluse who was still waiting with eyes fixed on the gibbet
we’ve no resistance to fear in the church
a big dog sat on its rump, looking at the fire
gudule’s heart, so horribly compressed, now dilated, and she murmured, casting a glance at her daughter whom she had not yet dared to look at since the men’s arrival: saved!
fornication is a most licentious thought
djali,  went on the girl, emboldened by her growing success, how does maître jacques charmolue, the king’s attorney in the ecclesiastical court, look when he preaches?
gringoire had passed from the love of an idea to love of the form of that idea
i beseech you,  he cried, if you have feelings, do not reject me!
he cried: a carthaginian!
so you can see that she came of good family
then the abundance that carthage had enjoyed made them furiously jealous
gringoire leaned over and whispered in the archdeacon’s ear, glancing anxiously up and down the street, though no one was passing by
he cried, with a laugh that bared his teeth and made his face look like a wolfs muzzle, two mice in the mouse-hole!
her eyes were dark and splendid, in the midst of her black hair a few loose strands shone as bright as gold thread where the sun had penetrated
where their hair had been torn out in tufts the sores on their heads were exposed, and they were so thin and hideous that they looked like mummies in tattered shrouds
they are rogues from the court of miracles
said the student; this must be it
what does it matter to you if i am there when your eyes are closed?
then the servant busied himself reading out all the proceeds of the iron mines of annaba, the coral fisheries, the purple works, the farming of the tax on resident greeks, the export of silver to arabia, where it was worth ten times as much as gold, captured vessels, less a tithe for the goddess’s temple
men were pushing with chest and arms, while others pulled, in harness
i’m very cold,  she answered
they did not lose heart, and marched behind him
gervaise went on, and the little one with little eyes, with red-rimmed eyelids, all plucked and jagged like a thistle-head?
dom claude just had time to fling himself to the ground to avoid a meeting, face to face, with his brother and being recognized by him
gisco slipped his fingers under the man’s jaw, for the helmet chinstrap eventually produced twin calloused patches there; these were called carobs, and to have carobs’ was an expression for a veteran
once he turned up just as she was fondling djali

they killed them with their lances; they ate them, and with full stomachs their thoughts were less gloomy
the crescent moon, which had just taken off above the horizon, stopped at that moment on top of the right-hand tower and seemed to be perching, like some luminous bird, on the edge of the balustrade, with its pattern of cut-out trefoils
in the middle of the terrace was a small ivory bed, covered with lynx skins, with cushions of parrot feathers (a soothsaying creature sacred to the gods), and in the four corners rose four long burners full of spikenard, incense, cinnamon, and myrrh
that’s a fixed fee
a large head bristling with red hair; between his shoulders an enormous hump, the effects of which were also visible in front; an assemblage of thighs and legs so strangely distorted that they touched only at the knees and, from the front, looked like two sickle blades joined at the handle; big feet, monstrous hands; and with all that deformity a certain air of fearsome energy, agility, and courage; a strange exception to the eternal rule which says that strength, like beauty, results from harmony
it was the first time for many hours that he felt no pain
each of them felt somehow injured in her own beauty
by the way, brother claude, a florin for not breathing
as for the little one—smelarda as they call her—i shall await your orders
you, priest, you are old!
then he went up to salammbo’s palace
those on the other hand who did not know hamilcar were quite delirious in their delight at having him in their grasp
cut off all their hands, and bring them to me in baskets!
first of all, to give only a few major examples, there are assuredly few finer pages in architecture than that façade where successively and simultaneously the three recessed, pointed doorways, the embroidered and serrated band of the twenty-eight royal niches; the immense central rose-window, flanked by the two side windows like the priest by deacon and sub-deacon, the lofty, slender gallery of trefoiled arches supporting a heavy platform on its delicate small columns; finally the two dark, massive towers with their slate eaves, harmonious parts of a magnificent whole, rising one above the other in five gigantic storeys, all unfold before one’s eye, multitudinous and unconfused with their innumerable details of statuary, sculpture, and carvings, adding powerfully to the calm grandeur of the whole; a vast symphony in stone, so to speak; the colossal work of a man and a people, at the same time one and complex, like its sisters the iliads and the romanceros, the prodigious result of contributions made from all the resources of an age, where every stone displays in hundreds of ways the workman’s imagination disciplined by the artist’s genius; a kind of human creation, in a word, as mighty and fruitful as the divine creation whose dual character it seems to have abstracted: variety, eternity
do not break out into thunder over such a nonentity as myself
listen, jehan,  he added in a low voice, be sure you never speak of what you see and hear here
and leaning over the carvings with the dazzled look of someone demonstrating living phenomena: don’t you think, for example, that this metamorphosis in basse-taille has been executed with much skill, delicacy, and patience?
some epirote shepherds ran to the left hand wing of the clibanarii and seized the horses by the mane as they whirled their staves; the animals, throwing their riders, ran off over the plain
it was a sort of investment of good works made on his young brother’s account; a parcel of good deeds which he wanted to put together for him in advance, in case the young rascal might one day find himself short of such currency, the only one accepted at the toll gate of paradise
at that thought, the eyes she was running over the populace filled with grief
spendius did not admit his terror and persisted in claiming that his leg was broken
the mercenaries’ bad faith was not as complete as their enemies thought
she found herself all alone
at last he shook his head and swung into the saddle
i don’t want to wreck my religion on his metaphysics!
some of them had pennons and some banners
panting with terror she tried to pull free

civilization has not yet reached the point where one can go about naked, as old diogenes wanted
the colleges, as they arrived, ranged themselves in the temple courtyards, on the outer galleries and along the double stairways which went up against the walls and met at the top
he expressed his sympathy for the trouble she was about to suffer
this time, however, its burning greed had led it into disgrace and danger
a number, from laziness or prudence, had stayed at the entrance to the defile
grève bay, grève rumble
i left the key in the door on purpose
they say she’s a witch, and that her goat performs quite miraculous tricks
he spent whole days with his face pressed against his window panes
and the great hall, with its gilding, its azure colouring, pointed arches, statues, pillars, the immense vault fretted with carvings?
you are ruining us!
the road snaked up and down over small hills
quasimodo looked at him, was seized with trembling, let go of the priest and drew back
so—for fifteen years now i’ve been here, fifteen years i’ve been suffering, fifteen years i’ve been praying, fifteen years i’ve been banging my head against these four walls
one should always lend, and at different rates of interest, according to people’s wealth
here, you deaf rascal!
the priest thought of midday

some fine mansions also projected magnificently over the picturesque attics of the left bank, the logis de nevers, the logis de rome, the logis de reims which have since disappeared; the hôtel de cluny, which still remains for the artist’s consolation, and whose tower was so stupidly pollarded a few years ago
the gypsy girl had stirred no more than he had
then you send them off with their wives and children, every one, without keeping a single hostage!
besides, all this floated around in her head in a melancholy haze like the memory of an oppressive dream; and she could not have found the means or the words to express it
from time to time she asked if they would soon be there
my herd of swine did us more good than a phalanx of spartans
however, when she saw her captain come in, she found him looking so fine, with his new acton, his gleaming baldrick, his passionate air, that she blushed with pleasure
whence the countless swift transformations of this architecture, only three centuries old, so striking after the stagnating immobility of romanesque architecture, which was six or seven centuries old
there was a clattering of rakes and furnaces
besides, using the veil as a shield, he held it out to left, to right, in front, behind; and they could think of no expedient
he said in a muffled voice
with time an indefinable close bond had been formed uniting the bell-ringer and the church
but here are strong men whose hatred has been aroused!
but he clapped his hands three times
and as the cauldron and the frying pan were not listening but continued their duet, he jumped down from his barrel, gave the cauldron a mighty kick, which sent it rolling ten yards away with the boy inside, kicked over the frying pan, spilling all the fat on to the fire, and then solemnly climbed back on his throne, paying no heed to the child’s muffled sobs nor to the old woman’s grumbling at the sight of her supper going up in a fine sheet of white flame
he was silhouetted against the sky
at notre-dame it was a cell constructed in the roof space of the side-aisles beneath the flying buttresses, facing the cloister, exactly at the spot where the wife of the present concierge of the towers has contrived for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of babylon what a lettuce is to a palm tree, or a porter’s wife to semiramis
the barbarians had leaped outside the fences
jacques charmolue intervened: if it please you, messieurs, we shall proceed with the interrogation of the goat
this was termed turning’ a criminal
it passed like a cloak under the idol’s face, sweeping up to spread over the wall, fastened up by the corners, all at once blue as the night, yellow as the dawn, crimson as the sun, manifold, diaphanous, sparkling, light
gringoire pressed on none the less
he suddenly felt a coolness on his face and found himself beneath the door of the topmost gallery
their boldness is quite amazing, and angers us greatly
the fires of the forward posts shone like lost stars
we’ll show you, pasque-dieu, whether we are a king or not!
he stood bare-headed, holding a long scroll, behind the armchair on which sat, inelegantly doubled up, knees crossed, elbow on the table, a very meanly turned-out individual
the girl listened to him, looked at him
great wings made shadows hover round them, croaking rent the air; and as spendius’ cross was the highest one, it was on his that the vulture came down
finally, between the rue saint-denis and the rue montorgueil, the filles-dieu
the sun was going down behind the waves; its rays like long arrows struck the crimson heart
he’s the one who cast me into this abyss
libyan women, riding on donkeys, reviled negresses who had abandoned the brothels of malqua for the soldiers; a number of them suckled children slung round their necks on a leather strap
yet he had received from his family some education and some manners; but he was too young when he had started to roam the country, too young when he had begun garrison duty, and with every day more of the gentlemanly veneer was rubbed away by the harsh pressure of his soldier’s baldric
from which clock, if you please?
in doing so he began your misfortunes, and mine, and his own
it was louis xl
calm gradually returned to la esmeralda’s soul
there was, however, no shortage of light
the stolen child cried and yelled
for some moments, the girl, absorbed in her delightful thoughts, had been dreaming to the sound of his voice without taking in the meaning of his words
meanwhile men sent by the suffete were arriving in the streets
often, on the hilltops, black tents collapsed as though blown over by the wind, and large discs with gleaming edges, recognizable as cartwheels spinning with a mournful sound, gradually plunged into the valleys
then the horde of merchants, all the sellers of wine and oil, furious at not being paid, grumbled at the republic; spendius declaimed against it
by the way, my lovely, what’s your name?
it’s crazy to stop half-way in what is monstrous!
suddenly narr’havas quietened them, and turning their backs they trotted back towards the hills
all resistance had been made impossible for him by what was then termed, in the style of the criminal chancellery, the vehemence and firmness of his bonds’, which means that the thongs and chains were probably cutting into his flesh
you are not shouting so loudly today!
is that you, master?
bell-ringer of notre-dame at number, a new disability had come to make him complete: the bells had ruptured his eardrums; he had become deaf
she listened, deeply touched
at that critical moment, he took counsel within himself, with a better and speedier line of reasoning than might have been expected of so ill-organized a brain
aiglet de soins, hutin de mailly
to have succeeded only in laying her down on the leather bed!
on the judges’ part it was the hope of being soon able to sit down to supper
thus, to give only a summary statement of a law which it would take volumes to develop, in the high orient, cradle of primitive times, after hindu architecture came phoenician architecture, opulent mother of arab architecture; in antiquity, after egyptian architecture, of which the etruscan style and the cyclopean monuments are only a variation, came greek architecture, of which the roman style is simply an extension, with the carthaginian dome put on top; in modern times, after romanesque architecture came gothic

he came in then, greeted the audience with the hereditary smile which the great bestow on the people, and advanced with measured step towards his scarlet armchair, looking as though his thoughts were elsewhere
the moon shone red as blood in a pale circle and their scarlet tongues, formed like fishing harpoons, stretched out, curling to the edge of the flame
besides the expense was bound to be excessive; he would be liable for almost all of it
he was a poor child, both thin and puffy; his skin looked as grey as the filthy rag hanging round his waist; his head was sunk on to his shoulders, and with the back of his hand he rubbed his fly-infested eyes
in wooden bowls from tamrapanni great lumps of fat floated in saffron
she ran away with loud cries as soon as she saw the soldiers’ pikes through the rocks
the rustling of the veil as it brushed against the stones reminded him of his new power; but excessive as his hopes were, he now no longer knew what he ought to do; this uncertainty unnerved him
they shone in the depths of an amphitheatre
captain phoebus’ heart, like the physics of the time, abhorred a vacuum
at each stage some of them died; several times they thought they were lost
among others there was a group of these merry devils who, after smashing the glass, had boldly ensconced themselves on the entablature of a window, and thence stared and jeered outside and inside in turn at the crowd in the hall and the crowd in the place outside
this was to push back the slaves curious to see their master, so that he should not be overwhelmed by their numbers and inconvenienced by their smell
how could he make quasimodo recognize him?
the great hall was now just a vast furnace of shameless merriment, where every mouth was a shout, every eye a sparkle, every face a grimace, every individual a posture
what a terrible child,  said the mother, smiling and scolding at the same time
let the spider get on with it!
how is she to be saved?
the base of the triangle rested on the far end of the square, so as to block the rue du parvis; one side faced the hôtel-dieu, the other the rue saint-pierre-aux-bœufs
they were a man and a woman
they won’t recognize his rights either as justiciary or over the highways
some of them were peeling bloody strips of material from their legs
he ventured a delicate question
there it is,  he said, let us begin!
others walked about excitedly; some were as pale as if they had been waiting for their own execution
he had observed temperatures, soils, stars, planted at the winter solstice, inspected the slaves, taken care over their clothes
don’t say that name!
the sick groaned on dromedaries; others limped along, supported on the stump of a pike
if i had understood i should have hastened to you: i would have abandoned the army; i would never have left carthage
jehan, accept your punishment at your master’s discretion

it was the month of schebaz, in mid-winter
amid this pile of houses one could also make out, by the tall, open-work stone mitres on the roof itself which then crowned the topmost windows of palaces, the hôtel given by the town, under charles vi, to juvénal des ursins; a little further on the tarred sheds of the marché-palus; elsewhere again the new apse of saint-germain-le-vieux, extended in number by taking in a bit from the rue-aux-febves; and then, here and there, a crossroads thronged with people, a pillory standing at a street corner, a fine section of philip-augustus pavement, magnificent flagstones scored in the middle to stop horses’ hooves slipping, and so poorly replaced in the sixteenth century by those wretched cobbles known as league paving’, a deserted backyard with one of those transparent staircases they used to build in the fifteenth century, one of which can still be seen in the rue des bourdonnais
clopin intervened, your name, rogue, and no more
they had been called out against carthage, and now they were going away from it!
what does this fellow think he’s doing?
monsieur,  the girl said, will they be going on?
before he endowed a mass for st john, the king should have found out whether the worthy st john enjoys latin chanted with a provençal accent
mouldy cheese into the bargain!
then, he was so hard of hearing that he did not catch a word of what the clerk said; however, he wanted to give the impression that he had heard, and replied: aha!
if i wish to see them!
this conclusive remark seemed to dispel all doubts in the mind of gringoire and other sceptics in the audience
i’m going back there—by the way, where’s that little student jehan who had all that scrap-iron round him?
the hosier, despite the signals that guillaume rym was sending him, appeared determined to stand up to the king
the priest, who was heaping gestures of anger and rebuke on the deaf man, bade him with a violent sign to withdraw
among the hundreds of faces stained scarlet by this glow, there was one which seemed even more absorbed than all the others in contemplating the dancer
and he signed the sentence thus modified
every time that young viper goes past my cell, she makes my blood curdle!
if instead of characteristic monuments like those we have just mentioned we examine the general picture of architecture from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, we observe the same phenomenon of decline and emaciation
besides, you know that a priest of eschmoûn is watching the cruel stars around the dog from which your illness derives
her pretty djali followed her
that’s odd,  the priest said thoughtfully
outside the infantry, near the velites, he placed the clibanarii, beyond them the numidians; when day broke both sides were thus drawn up face to face
he hastened off with the veterans
i saw her when she was only four months old
at once furious resistance began
non timebo millia populi circumdantis me: exsurge, domine; salvum me fac, deus!
pinker than the satin shoes!
gringoire returned her caresses
and who would command them?
that serves him right,  said robert poussepain, who still bore a grudge againt quasimodo; that will teach him to be rough with people
mâtho pulled them to the rear
the old trull with her white whiskers won’t give me credit
he had been seen along the gulf with the mercenaries, by the lagoon with the numidians, on the lake shore with the negroes, and from the end of the plain he drove on masses of soldiers who came up unceasingly against the lines of fortifications
there were gauls on the eridanus who needed a push, canaanites at cyrene who would have come, and while the romans send ambassadors to ptolemy…’
he added, with an effort: a woman who loves you
when they find me in that cell, got up so grotesquely in skirt and coif, perhaps they’ll just roar with laughter
the child smiled, dazzled by such splendour, and growing bolder he was even beginning to clap his hands and jump about when hamilcar led him off
it is still the pantheon in the parthenon, st peter’s, rome
but tanit is your enemy,  spendius replied: she is persecuting you, and you are dying from her anger
every eye remained riveted there, and the new arrivals, their cursed names, their faces, and their costumes constituted a continual distraction
those stars are worlds too
back there, master’; and throwing off the veils she rubbed her face with her sleeve; the dark colour, the servile trembling, the bent back, all disappeared
yes, it is me!
he had himself taken to the baths, and called for his cooks
she opened her eyes, and saw the gaunt arm of the stone gibbet stretched out above her head
formidable shouts of derision broke out from the barbarian troops, and spendius, mounted on his dromedary, cried: ha!
they went forward slowly, because of their enormous weight
then they went back to the pay slaves and started killing again
her eyes were just visible beneath her half-closed lids
the blazing sun came down hot on bare heads
he would have sacrificed twenty times more for such an enterprise to succeed
a sort of idiot grin uncovered his pale gums; his great wild eyes looked at the crowd of barbarians around him
we must admire and ceaselessly leaf through the book written by architecture; but we must not deny the grandeur of the building raised in its turn by printing
he would have driven her mad
the birds were already singing, a cold wind blew, little clouds scudded across the paling sky
i am a wretch, viler than scorpions, viler than mud and dust!
it took much trouble and much patience before claude frollo managed to teach him to talk
so the witch girl escaped!
three hours later he was still plunged in the cinnamon oil with which the bath had been filled; and as he bathed, he ate, on a stretched out ox hide, flamingo tongues with poppy seed seasoned with honey
you’re very kind, messieurs the sergeants, i love you all
they went up slowly, and as the smoke swirled away in high eddies, they seemed from a distance to be disappearing into a cloud
if the witch is still in notre-dame, should she be seized there in spite of the asylum?
he was in touch with only two things in the world, notre-dame and claude frollo
at his first distant sight of this mule and this priest the poor victim’s face softened, the fury contracting it gave way to a strange smile, full of ineffable gentleness, docility, and affection
perhaps he chose the day?
the bewildered, unfortunate girl seemed to have lost all sight and reason within the dark interior of the church
pour all your sound out into the square
brother, jehan has treated your gracious counsels like straw and dung to be trampled underfoot
you are suffering, aren’t you?
he made a tour of the cell
the king’s good humour, ever since he had been informed of the revolt against the bailiff, came through in everything
in silence they reached the rue des bernardins, which was more or less deserted
then the men in red mantles intoned the sacred hymn
there’s one over in the shed at the maison-aux-piliers,  the man answered
the stranger did not answer a word
to limit ourselves to the cell in the tour-roland, we have to say that it had never been short of recluses
can any sweeter pleasure be imagined than that of passing sentence and judgement, as messire robert d’estouteville did every day in the grand châtelet, beneath philip-augustus’s broad, flattened arches?
i feel quite robust
there still remained sixty of them
there he is dismounting!—he’s about to go into that house!—phoebus!—he can’t hear me!
he added, with hands clasped together, bells, don’t bell!
and paid for from the tax on salt-water fish sold in the paris market, what’s more!
the water was flowing imperceptibly on to the terrace and hamilcar, extraordinarily enough, did not seem concerned about it
it grew still darker
with some difficulty quasimodo managed to recognize in the man the handsome captain, and in the woman the young lady whom he had seen that morning, welcoming the officer from that very same balcony
it was an image of truth, the very spirit of his words
bit of old rag,  she muttered, and, turning to gringoire: let’s see your cape!
far from damping down her mystic desires, he excited them, and even seemed to delight in grieving her by the revelations of a merciless doctrine

first filed past the priests of the pataeci gods, then those of eschmoûn, those of melkarth and all the other colleges in succession, with the same insignia and in the same order as they had observed for the sacrifice
in cathedrals it was, as it were, another cathedral underground, low, dark, mysterious, blind and dumb, beneath the upper nave flooded with light and resounding day and night with organ and bells; sometimes it was a sepulchre
sometimes, when a bearded vulture, perched on a corpse, had been tearing it up for a long time, a man would begin crawling towards it with a javelin in his teeth
it was the jackals coming to eat up the remains
he had remained kneeling, hands folded as though in prayer, attentive, scarcely breathing, eyes fixed steadily on the gypsy’s shining pupils
but once the lecture was over he none the less calmly resumed his lawless and outrageous ways
when it was full of blood they plunged their arms into it
gringoire himself was not far from finding the whole business frightening and probable

architecture came back from the crusades with the pointed arch, as the nations did with their freedom
at the last moment everything could have been saved: there was no need to flee
he will go mad!
misfortune should help to make us cleverer
he was dressed in rags, and was walking with one knee bent and the foot dragging
hamilcar did not worry about it
he leaned panting against the wall to keep himself from falling
i am a wretch!
come of it what may, i’ll go to my brother
gringoire had scarcely raised to his lips this heady cup of joy and triumph when a dash of bitterness was mixed into it
master, one day you will enter carthage, between the colleges of the pontiffs, and they will kiss your sandals: and if tanit’s veil still weighs on you, you can put it back in her temple
being a robber doesn’t make you a jew
the men from the parliament will be properly caught tomorrow when they come to fetch her!
he seized his head, and resting it on his knee sawed at it rapidly; it fell; two great jets of blood made a hole in the dust
then they advanced like swirls of sand raised by the wind
at dawn and at dusk prowlers sometimes roamed along the walls
taanach, i wish i could dissolve in my prayers like a flower in wine!
the routed escort galloped at his side
they stopped for a moment in front of this body of soldiers massed around the rat-hole, gazed in amazement, and went on their way
but strange cries, at once hoarse and shrill, could be heard in the room, above hanno’s voice and the clattering of the dishes being set round him

more from astonishment than pity, no doubt, they were allowed to finish the dish
there are signs everywhere of the day after a public holiday
we could boil him alive at the marché-aux-pourceaux before he said anything
and he’s a kind king too!
he thought that some plot was being hatched against the unfortunate refugee
how intently you are looking at that officer!
no doubt, looking at these two bibles so widely open through the centuries, one may be permitted to regret the loss of the visible majesty of that granite writing, those gigantic alphabets formulated as colonnades, pylons, and obelisks, those man-made mountains, as it were, covering the earth and the past from the pyramid to the steeple, from cheops to strasbourg
that’s a trade you can always take up when you are a vagrant, and it’s better than stealing, as some of my larcenous young friends advised me to do
do not ask hindu, egyptian, romanesque masonry for a corrected design or improved statuary
then he secretly accused the rabbet of his life’s misfortune
the wretched man repeated
(gringoire had known that since the beginning of winter)
what have you done with my phoebus?
that’s not up to much!
he added, looking around: where is she?
one step outside the sanctuary and he fell back into the water
gisco spread out the syssitia accounts, entered in violet paint on sheepskin; he read out everything that had come into carthage, month by month, and day by day
a gentleman holding the king’s commission with letters of appointment going back to the time of the marriage of louis xi’s natural daughter to the bastard of bourbon was something wondrous in number the same day that robert d’estouteville had replaced jacques de villiers as provost of paris, maître jean dauvet replaced messire hèlye de thorettes as first president of the court of parliament, jean jouvenel des ursins supplanted pierre de morvilliers in the office of chancellor of france, regnault des dormans relieved pierre puy of the post of master of requests in ordinary in the king’s household
it was believed to be born of the earth’s clay, since it emerges from the earth’s depths and does not need feet to move over it; its progress recalled the rippling of rivers, its temperature the ancient, viscous darkness full of fertility, and the circle it describes, as it bites its own tail, the planetary system, eschmoûn’s intelligence
number livres number sols number deniers!
then they risked themselves in the water channel
the two armies, emerging from their tents, watched; the people of utica pressed on to the ramparts for a better view
captain phoebus de châteaupers, you are lying!
maybe they’ll hang you, but she’ll be saved
so saying, he threw, deft as a monkey, a small coin into the greasy hat that the beggar held out with his affected arm
don’t rot away like an illiterate donkey on the straw of the lecture-room floor
he could not help shaking his head sorrowfully
do you persist in your denial?
the reprisals after such a murderous attack would be fearful
justice at that time was very little concerned with precision and propriety in criminal trials
some, their temples transfixed by a javelin, swayed their heads like bears
in the hollow tread-wheels men could be seen going up rung by rung
asked the archdeacon, fixing a penetrating stare on coictier’s companion
un cofre de gran riqueza
unfortunately hardly anything remains of these monuments in which gothic art drew the line so precisely between riches and economy
they were no longer afraid
he approached them on tiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a very low voice to charmolue: it was guillaume de paris who had a job carved on that lapis-lazuli coloured stone, with gilded edges
he had had her after the death of several male children
he sometimes questioned her about her journey to the mercenaries’ camp
do whatever you like!
but there was no longer a rope round her neck, her hands were no longer bound
he was rubbing his hands together and laughing with that inward laughter which makes the face beam
she was not very tall, but her slim figure stood so boldly straight that she seemed to be so
the students, pressing at the window, greeted them as they passed by with sarcastic sallies and ironic applause
learned doctor, i make mock of learning; gentleman, i besmirch my name; priest, i use the missal as a pillow for lust, i spit in the face of my god!
the carthaginians shut themselves up inside; they did not move out again
he made one more effort with trouillefou
and i come to you, brother, with a heart full of contrition
what do you want with me?
a bird’s-eye view of paris
let me run away!
business is bad enough as it is!
suddenly he heard the boards of the wooden staircase creaking
salammbo rapidly recoiled, she was so afraid of this loathsome creature, hideous as a mask and terrible as a phantom
do you love me?
there was only one entrance, a modern door, set in a surbased arch, furnished on the inside with a tapestry, and on the outside with one of those irish wood porches, frail structures of curiously worked joinery, which one could still see a hundred and fifty years ago in many old houses
it was filled with much noise and many people
hosier is fine enough!
the men, on the contrary, were delighted and applauded
then they turned their desire on to the wounded and sick
non cuiquam datum est habere nasum [it is not given to everyone to have a nose]—you’re truly divine, jacqueline ronge-oreille!
from françois ii to louis xv the disease has grown worse in geometrical progression
the numidian king arrived in hamilcar’s tent; and he said, pointing to his men who had stopped still at a distance:
they made him drink some wine, and he wept; then he burst out in a torrent of words
i must have a very eleemosynary look about me for anyone to ask for my charity with my purse as lean as it is
independently of the missiles that he had piled up on the balustrade, he had built up a heap of stones on the platform itself
this priest was the archdeacon, dom claude frollo
i show the girl and the captain to the upstairs room, and i leave them on their own, that is, with the goat

in india, vyasa is complex, strange, impenetrable as a pagoda
the poor mother poured out in streams over this adored hand the deep, black well of tears within her, into which all her grief had filtered drop by drop for fifteen years
then, when they happened to lift their heads and look at each other, they choked with sobs as they discovered how horribly ravaged their faces were
there, i know who he is,  said one; he’s maître andry musnier
soon they stumbled and had to swim
let us come back to the façade of notre-dame, as it still appears at the present day, when we go piously to admire the solemn and mighty cathedral which, according to its chroniclers, inspires terror: quae mole sua terrorem incutit spectantibus [which by its mass strikes spectators with terror]
he came up, went away, and, constantly renewing this manoeuvre, gradually detached them from their camps
that’s the clerk to the court of parliament
gringoire said to himself with a sigh, the others are listening
then, as she stayed still, he cried out to ask what she wanted
and then,  claude went on shrewdly, what sort of children’s clothes are going to cost number florins?

be an honest man yourself; remain monsieur le maire; remain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent; rear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain in the galleys
the traveller paid to lagny
eternal flood and ebb of popular favor!
he drew near, and perceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket of water
i prefer to be the head of a fly rather than the tail of a lion
marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall
had he entered upon this love affair, which had ended in his marriage to cosette, without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings?
this society no longer exists
his actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it
the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern
were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragic beings merely dreams?
i am at the end of my finances, pursued the doctor; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of the paintings of jehan fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating
there are two hours yet to the pillory

one summer evening, when louis philippe was returning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee, perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly; the king, with that good-nature which came to him from henry iv, helped the gamin, finished the pear, and gave the child a louis, saying: the pear is on that also
on these mattresses they had laid the wounded
then the two men parted
however, this sceptic had one fanaticism
fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to jean valjean:-there is another thing which bothers me
no ill-temper, no harshness
you promised me that you would give me anything i like-- yes!
it is the cellar of the blind

until order, which is nothing else than universal peace, has been established, until harmony and unity reign, progress will have revolutions as its halting-places
i did wrong to spoil that gentleman's hat
it is not hard to meet him
so charles v s wall suffered the fate of that of philip augustus
he thought he was putting marius on the right road, and that the child would yield
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him
from year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness
the soothsayers practise it
all cherished some rancor against him, some for his malice, others for his ugliness
marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness
she fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream

in fact, what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?
the most terrible of motives, the most unanswerable of retorts--because
it is in this grand hall that the court is held
all eyes turned to the estrade reserved for the flemish envoys
he was dressed in an ecclesiastical costume
besides, before you told me you had one which i knew
from time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor
they will ask nothing better
i ca not go out for lack of a coat
once only, on the occasion of one of these departures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a little blind-alley at the corner of which she read: impasse de la planchette
you can read it, said he
this time it was no mirage
cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall
said jupiter, a scholar has just seized the ladder
he had but one idea now, to die; and he did not wish to be turned aside from it, but he reflected, in his gloomy somnambulism, that while destroying himself, he was not prohibited from saving some one else
it seemed as though his feet were nailed to the pavement
one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief
there opportunities of losing oneself abound
gallantry claimed her once more; men came to see la chantefleurie; she found customers again for her merchandise, and out of all these horrors she made baby clothes, caps and bibs, bodices with shoulder-straps of lace, and tiny bonnets of satin, without even thinking of buying herself another coverlet--master eustache, i have already told you not to eat that cake--it is certain that little agnes, that was the child’s name, a baptismal name, for it was a long time since la chantefleurie had had any surname--it is certain that that little one was more swathed in ribbons and embroideries than a dauphiness of dauphiny!
every sort of gulf had opened again within him
i am dying, said she
the supreme moment was approaching
ponsonby destroyed, somerset remained
neither that illustrious england nor that august germany enter into the problem of waterloo
with too much haste perhaps

the vat of trophonius contains nothing that is not in mesmer's tub; ergaphilas lives again in cagliostro; the brahmin vasaphanta become incarnate in the comte de saint-germain; the cemetery of saint-medard works quite as good miracles as the mosque of oumoumie at damascus
there is no one who does not occasionally accept in this mechanical way
let us not go too far, however; in what concerns jean valjean, this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial
the boat made its way slowly towards the right shore
where are you going?
the moon was full that night
i seem to have feathers under my head
a sound of foam was audible; but the river could not be seen
we are ignorant and impious
perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs
as for cleaning out,-- that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather than swept away
fantine listened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and m madeleine heard her say, in a low voice: how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter!

one would suppose that six centuries separated these pillars from that door

young men have such bad taste nowadays!
the sound of the latch roused him
before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force, hurled this cluster of men backward into the place
the porter's lodge was closed
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something
it was high time
monsieur, said the clerk, do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the morning
the abyss is subject to these treacheries
nevertheless, he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character
he had passed lillois and bois-seigneur-isaac

or on his knees, said rym
they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front

he plunged to his heart’s content in evil thoughts, and in proportion as he sank deeper, he felt a satanic laugh burst forth within him
he kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care
filled is exactly the word; certainly the bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds
when he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt
this gave each man fifteen rounds to fire
to have succeeded only in stretching her upon the leather bed!
he did not understand in the least, and opened it
perhaps this was only a rough draft
it was he who possessed the wit
in the bride's trap
i shall call her catherine, she said

the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys

he had before him that deaf and implacable house, six stories in height, which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window; he had on his right the rather low barricade, which shut off the rue de la petite truanderie; to pass this obstacle seemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets was visible
javert gazed at m madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and said in a tranquil voice:-mr mayor, i cannot grant you that
it sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary to liberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote, even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of its anguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions, of its fevers, of its distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, of its darkness, that great and despairing body, the rabble, protests against, and that the populace wages battle against, the people
it has its buttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses browse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one walks over this uncultivated land, and one's foot dives into mole-holes
suppose a case:i am a traveller; i say to the diligence, i will go on in advance; you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass
there are fathers who do not love their children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson
he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall, for fear of alarming her
let us inform ourselves of the trap
during the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted, without marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley
she did not wake
and then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in that case it skimmed the streets
he loved books; books are cold but safe friends
the words passive obedience indicate this
is there, then, no way of forcing this door, exclaimed the king of thunes, stamping his foot

in the midst of his torments, and long before this, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes
you saved my life, said the man
waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century
every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes' cloak
the gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively
the two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the hand
the one who was in advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other
a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers, some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of
i get down at vernon, in order to take the branch coach for gaillon
the result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had been mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, but that they ought to hasten towards saint-merry; that if there was anything to do, and any bousingot to track out, it was in that quarter

the big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's

the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts
the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature
this book was on one of the upper shelves
and then, gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband
montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk
these accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony
he found dom claude greatly changed; pale as a winter’s morning, with hollow eyes, and hair almost white
i offer you a cutlet and you answer me: by the way, i want to marry
my friends, long live women!
but in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth, his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly
i like this better, said m gillenormand
he said to himself with a sort of joy that-- it was certainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;-- that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such a father!
there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing
cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper, each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting, as cosette thought
at every blow dealt by the formidable rabbi, from the depths of his cell, upon this nail, that one of his enemies whom he had condemned, were he a thousand leagues away, was buried a cubit deep in the earth which swallowed him
a word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed
if you succeed in removing the purse without our hearing the bells, you are a vagabond, and you will be thrashed for eight consecutive days
the streets were invested, the church backed on the river
and he offered the two newspapers, unfolded, to marius, the reader is acquainted with these two papers
was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?
if your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff, he is lost
his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light
without doubt, this strange beacon light would awaken far away, the woodcutter of the hills of bicêtre, terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame quivering over his heaths
then there would be an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, a confrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time, fauchelevent, coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about his neck, the future
i can bear the comparison!
it was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands, and a tear in her great eyes
thus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obligingly opened to jean valjean, was a bit of cleverness on thenardier's part

he appeared to have grown thin and pale
what shall i do until then?
it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those who had fathers
at the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthful artisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man, emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman's voice:-monsieur marius, if you please
sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shop on the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, an awkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yet angry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished wife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, wrapped it up in a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, and went away

fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:-ah!
she told herself that she was not sure of anything, that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful
and she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating of her window, her hair dishevelled, her eyes flashing, with her shoulder striking against the wall, with the wild air of a female wolf in a cage, who has long been famished, and who feels the hour for her repast drawing near
the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the others turned away, each according to his nature
fantine had become terrible
volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth
they say she is a sorceress, and that her goat executes very miraculous tricks
the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing

then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it was alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw, which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula, and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet, its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings
at that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville, caught sight of an old holster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant's shop
it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his immediate disposal, so that, it was added, m madeleine could make his appearance at laffitte's any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes

she refused the cake which mahiette offered to her, and said, black bread

mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him
his name was ultime fauchelevent
thus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusion of consternation, all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the universe were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple and terrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due to legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy, the government, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legal infallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all this was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, javert, the spy of order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog providence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, at the summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he had come; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul
one evening during that same month of april, jean valjean had gone out; cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown
you were among them
; make him sing the marseillaise, and he will free the world

not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim, except to jeer at his thirst
towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a man turned from the rue saint-antoine at a run, made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july, and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant
louis philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present day, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor before history; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently and above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: this one flattered the other

said he, have no more fear of me than i have for you!
but then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive?
then his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind
nevertheless, there was one human creature whom quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was claude frollo
we are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
that done, she laid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep
the plateau of mont-saint-jean was captured, recaptured, captured again
she was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual
what we are doing is not wholly innocent
when facts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, the slightest complication stops and entangles them
to have taken her from me thus; you could never have looked at me with her, when i was joyously warming her at my fire, when she laughed as she suckled, when i made her tiny feet creep up my breast to my lips?

gringoire fell backwards, quite thunderstruck with joy
how do i know?--a mere nothing, a horse, a remark!

simplice of sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse-- a lie which would have saved her
from that moment forth, all was over; the ogre of corsica,-- the usurper,--the tyrant,--the monster who was the lover of his own sisters,--the actor who took lessons of talma,--the poisoner of jaffa,--the tiger,--buonaparte,--all this vanished, and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of caesar
so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, monsieur pontmercy
what say you, messieurs les bourgeois?
these squares were no longer battalions, they were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were a tempest
replied the fat magistrate, half aroused, it’s tolerably jolly, that’s a fact
what will become of her, poor creature?
only, he felt that he could not do otherwise, now that he used thou to cosette, than say you to eponine
thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, in order to preserve it from the rats, as he said
let us inflict punishment, since we are history: old blucher disgraced himself
jean valjean tore up his shirt, bandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood; then bending over marius, who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred

nevertheless, the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern palace, bristling with carved eaves, covered with sheets of lead, where coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze, that roof, so curiously damascened, darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice; whose huge and ancient towers, rounded by age like casks, sinking together with old age, and rending themselves from top to bottom, resembled great bellies unbuttoned
i must inform you that i have just seen the king, louis xi, and that i have caught this oath from him,--_pasque-dieu_!

one would have said that they were two criminals
marius' emotion was profound
the waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads, around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all

they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order
a redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius, rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years

he had been a terrible man
but let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary soldier, out of the question

dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march
tumultuous and stagnant gulf
madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest:-we say that this house is not safe at all; that if monseigneur will permit, i will go and tell paulin musebois, the locksmith, to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the work of a moment; for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by; and i say that we need bolts, monseigneur, if only for this night; moreover, monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in'; and besides, even in the middle of the night, o mon dieu!
he felt that icy breath close to him, on his heels

what was she doing?
these men did not astonish each other
he reflected that had he not given his five francs to the jondrette girl in the morning, he would have followed m leblanc's fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jondrettes and that m leblanc would have been lost, and his daughter with him, no doubt

and, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his knees in the mire
they had wit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance; they should have succeeded

he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he owed her his happiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet her
eponine and azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true

a man for nothing!
jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction
nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them
the profile had a rose in its mouth
at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness

the barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed
the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time
in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion; and it irritated him to have that within him
cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good one, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many little children, cosette was rather merry in the evening
but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt?
consider that i pray you on my knees, as one prays to jesus christ!
a full hour passed in the most profound silence
it's true that i became bankrupt, that i am in hiding, that i have no bread, that i have not a single sou, that i am a villain!
moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the rue du fouarre, did not know what it was to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_, and had cut no figure in that revolt of number, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of the sixth trouble of the university
jean prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied woman, wept over the child, confounded god and the future in the same confidence, and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head, that of andre chenier
the one who is in the shadows

with his right hand, the deaf man detached one by one, in silence, with sinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers, the helmet, the cuirass, the leg pieces
and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck, he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where the scarf became a shawl once more
he had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public

it was a dog scanning a thief
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath

why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit-picpus?
meanwhile, jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice:
she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady; i call her cosette, but her name is really euphrasie

cosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven
i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop
the man bowed lower at that harsh voice
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it
it was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind him, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to obtain a quittance from the past

we have so many expenses
by dint of toil, perseverance, courage, and will, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year
no, said the gypsy
murmured marius, how beautiful you are!
my dear, continued fleur-de-lys, with decided sharpness, you will get yourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle
the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled
farewell to mystery, myth, law
the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of number was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was the halt
the spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of the tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every one who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, a terrific fire burst forth

now, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal, the nine parts of self-esteem in gringoire, swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious augmentation, beneath which disappeared, as though stifled, that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets; a precious ingredient, by the way, a ballast of reality and humanity, without which they would not touch the earth
they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling, entreating, wringing their hands
fantine did not seem to hear it

jean had no work
what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
the doctor examined marius, and after having found that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, without a pillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even a trifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration

it was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim:-just see there!
the roll was called
on that same night, then, when little gavroche picked up the two lost children, brujon and guelemer, who knew that babet, who had escaped that morning, was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse, rose softly, and with the nail which brujon had found, began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood

my friends, there is a morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but your families will; and what sufferings!
the landlady's red and violent face brightened up hideously
was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?
the woman remained motionless
to see her once again; he still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it
a glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler's wagon with a fluted wicker hood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to nivelles, at the angle of the road from mont-saint-jean to braine l'alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages

if a flood comes, the mountains will have long disappeared beneath the waves, while the birds will still be flying about; and if a single ark floats on the surface of the cataclysm, they will alight upon it, will float with it, will be present with it at the ebbing of the waters; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold, on its awakening, the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring above it, winged and living

but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss
what is the matter?
he was transparent but impenetrable
meanwhile, the archdeacon was panting

hardly the sound of a breath was audible
did i exist before my birth?
you shall see, gentlemen, that i, in my turn, can say: it is impossible
claude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself, believed that he saw, that he saw with his actual eyes, the bell tower of hell; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior furnace; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks, so many death groans
gringoire scratched his ear, with a very serious air
we are going to bring him back, to take him with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leave us again

here, i have burned my coat
each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from gringoire’s loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion

he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by jordaens, executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confused and hap-hazard manner
marius directed his steps towards that red light
courage was necessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm

you will see how well the whole thing will work
nevertheless, whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin, if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible that he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly

to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror!
the whole barricade gave vent to a cry; but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy; for the gamin to touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth; gavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting posture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms in the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and began to sing: je suis tombe par terre, i have fallen to the earth, c'est la faute a voltaire;'tis the fault of voltaire; le nez dans le ruisseau, with my nose in the gutter, c'est la faute a

it was an odd moment when cosette's rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll

this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers; those peoples are rascals; and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures; and i was going off to denounce myself; and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly!

as possessor of this fief, claude frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in paris and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the hôtel de tancarville, belonging to master françois le rez, and the college of tours, in the records deposited at saint martin des champs
stupefied, he turned round
come, said gringoire to himself, with a sigh, the others are listening

a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements

her cap had fallen on her knees
in vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this chamber she was stricken with horror

thenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse, drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean
she lifted the stone, which was tolerably large
each vied with the other in laying his claws upon him
the insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms
it is all the same to me, she said
we have already seen something of his history
the deaf man gazed at her
a filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief
he held both these arms with one hand, and groped along the wall with the other
thenardier exclaimed:-are you mad!
i put it in my pocket

there existed some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all appearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man

the senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way, heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called conscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his goal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
it was the man with the axe, who was growing merry
the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit-picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud, whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall
wellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry
none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man
he had said, i see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to be troops

poor creature, he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, he is hungry
then, although it was still broad daylight,--it was summer,-- he lighted them
why had not javert arrested jean valjean?
i ask nothing better, dom claude; but what if i entangle myself in some villanous affair?
m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of his glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, a serious thing at his age, he was interested

the whole thing was compact, overwhelming, and misshapen
moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and then, she would not have said anything in any case
on recovering from his first stupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on the stage, go on!
i do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but i may be of use, nevertheless
they assembled in paris in two localities, near the fish-market, in a wine-shop called corinthe, of which more will be heard later on, and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue saint-michel called the cafe musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman, the second to the students
the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated, beneath the elephant's belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it
he walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along the walls of the houses
the sun had succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the drawing-room
it--that barricade, chance, hazard, disorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown-- had facing it the constituent assembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage, the nation, the republic; and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise
and all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb, the cemetery and the city; that living being cut off from the human community, and thenceforth reckoned among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness; that remnant of life flickering in the grave; that breath, that voice, that eternal prayer in a box of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illuminated with another sun; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb; that soul a prisoner in that body; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell, and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite, the murmur of that soul in pain;--nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd
the reader has divined, no doubt, that thenardier's pursuer was no other than javert
but, sad to say, from time to time, the exceptional becomes necessary

she sewed seventeen hours a day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earnings of working-women to nine sous
tis more than a year since the tail of a stone cart dashed against my window and broke in the grating
a few paces distant, an enormous pillar, then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault, in the centre of its width
the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees, cosette was meditating; an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invincible sadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows, from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour

this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion

and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread
the child, whose thoughts were still on the thenardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
the door opened instantly, and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp, both of which trembled
yes, monsieur le maire
a pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting
and she went on: this is what i call being good: being nice and coming and living here,-- there are birds here as there are in the rue plumet,--living with us, quitting that hole of a rue de l'homme arme, not giving us riddles to guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfasting with us, being my father

but not for so long
since i tell you so
he cried to cosette:-go away with you!
so it's you, you little wretch!
he had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding meditation, he said to him in a rather patronizing way, good day, master jacques

two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort of yellow vestment, in cut like a chasuble

she will find my letter
that, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die of hunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and physically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have patience; that that would even have been better for those poor little children; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable, unfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar, and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong

said he, there's the wick giving out
enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman's face, had about him at that moment something of the antique themis
cosette had meant to scratch, and she lacerated
the wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb; every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks; he feels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate
in the incomprehensible plan of these streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two clusters of great streets, like magnified sheaves of grain, one in the university, the other in the town, which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates
at moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, and undulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no one knows whence, and converting it into a snake
to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries, to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strike with lightning, to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory, to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of titans, to conquer the world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what greater thing is there?

i have that fatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration, that consideration humiliates me, and crushes me inwardly, and, in order that i may respect myself, it is necessary that i should be despised
one can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's head the crown of hot iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of red hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering?
cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled her caresses, as though she desired to pay marius' debt
it was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and equivocal being, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and the other like a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin
great things had been accomplished, with it alongside
the hydra at the beginning, the angel at the end
marius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt it vanishing within him

he has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is far better

at recreation hours, jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some unknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, that great anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word, and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute, in a lightning flash, the people and god

that which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all?
is it not the sower?
in this manner she reached the spring
she began to laugh
can one be more white and blonde?
there was no longer anything in the street; there was nothing in the garden
this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it
nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it: disinterestedness
her candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed
the matter is simple

was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future king charles vii
then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
in the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better
he did not stir
he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire
was the fire wholly extinct there?
this man has insinuated himself into your confidence, and almost into your family under a false name
he said to himself: there may still be a glimpse of life there, perchance; i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark!
the poor children, including gavroche, were famished
it was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put to himself: is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert?

these voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted
his face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks, produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale

pontmercy fought at spire, at worms, at neustadt, at turkheim, at alzey, at mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchard's rearguard

he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of l'homme arme became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois
