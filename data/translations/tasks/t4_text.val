i wrote to thomas just lately
leo naphta came from a little place near the galician-volhynian border
and yet, naphta added, after a pause, i would counsel you not to take this man and what he stands for as altogether a laughing matter; since we are on the subject, let me warn you to be on your guard
the hostess herself, her brother justus and his wife, and little therese weichbrodt were all well past sixty; while old frau consul buddenbrook, uncle gotthold's widow, born sliiwing, as well aa madame kethelsen, now, alas almost entirely deaf, were already in the seventies

his wife, who had given a sign to ida jungmann, held him back
but it is only fair to say one thing: i was just a child when i was married, a perfect goose, a silly little thing
the servants and the poor folk had had their presents and gone; ida jung-mann was chattering with riekchen severin in the hall--al-though generally, as a governess, she preserved a proper dis-tance between herself and the frau consul's maid--the lights of the great tree were burnt down and extinguished, the mon-ger was in darkness

lle deliberately brought to kretschmar unfinished things in order to be told what he knew already, then to laugh at the ar- tistic sense, the connoisseurship, of his teacher, which entirely co- incided with his own: the understanding which is the actual agent of the work-idea - not the idea of a particular work but the idea of the opus itself, the objective and harmonic creation complete, the manager of its unified organic nature; which sticks the cracks together, stops up the holes, brings out that natural flow - which was not there in the first place and so is not nat- ural at all, but a product of art - in short, only in retrospect and indirectly does this manager produce the impression of the spon- taneous and organic

unwilling to make him out as either better or worse than he really was, we feel bound to mention that the wretched wehsal, one evening when they were alone, prayed him, with pallid lips, for the love of god to tell him what had taken place after the mardi gras festivities, and hans castorp had good-naturedly complied, without, as the reader may imagine, introducing any wanton or flippant element into his recital

on the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with a broader flow, freshly and youthfully—but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or—and this is a sign of low vitality—it was never very well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been but a watch in the night

you see nothing but political trickery in the lofty exertions of democracy to fulfil itself internationally— where you would like me to see idealism or even religiosity
even the great-aunt, when the news travelled up to her end of the table, gave him a meaningful glance and smile; pretty marusja, who had barely looked at him up to now, leaned over and stared, with her round brown eyes, her handkerchief to her lips—and shook her finger too
we did not know
i’ve ordered another couple of hundred of my maria lately
you see in me a man who fought unwearied against fate, but was finally struck down
would not that, for me, the ordinary man, have something mortifying and depressing about it?
to-day he made a scene at the sitting of the central paupers' deputation; and a few days ago in the finance department the old skunk!
she took it with patience and tranquillity
yes, went on the youth, i made her acquaintance—a thing that isn’t so easy, hereabouts, you know
how’s everything in the big world?
you shall not pretend i had anything to do with your waiting—if you did wait—that i encouraged you to it, or even permitted it
frau magnus heaved a heavy sigh
he’s so lean—yet he’s robust; that is the impression he makes, at least that’s the impression i got at breakfast
why, my dear mother, he answered, what is there to say?
i saw that inez, who set such store by patrician dignity and conservative pro- priety, who indeed had only married to gratify those tastes, chose to go about with natalie rather than with the staid spouses of her husband's colleagues, the typical german professors' wives
petersen translated, glancing now and then at the other page of his book, which should have had nothing on it
hans castorp stood his ground

while frau ziemssen, with her arm about his shoulders, tried to do so, he said hurriedly that he must write out an application for an extension of his leave and hand it in at once; and even while he said this, the short crossing came to pass, as hans castorp, reverently watching in the light of the red-shaded table-lamp, quickly perceived
her voice was growing louder all the time with vexation
it could never be popular; and the church, accordingly, had at all times been unpopular
near their destination was a beautiful view of a rocky stretch of the zügenstrasse
whether he had actually lived, settembrini said, was uncertain; yet his time had given birth to an idea, which had continued its triumphant course even up to to-day: the idea of the dignity of the human spirit, the idea of equality—in a word, they were celebrating the birth of individualistic democracy, and to it he would empty the glass they gave him
thy plaintive anthem fades
his black cravat showed wear, and he wore no cuffs, as hans castorp saw at once from the lax way the sleeve hung round the wrist
for although he was at bottom glad that settembrini, after all that had passed, continued, as he did, still to talk to him, admonishing, instructing, seeking to establish an influence upon his mind, yet his understanding had reached the point where he was critical of the italian’s words, and at times, up to a point, withheld his assent
i will speak to the bathing-master early to-morrow morning, when he comes to my room
but now i have something else in mind, went on tony
the names at the end of the alphabet had lately been called in the ovid class, and presumably they would begin again at the beginning
lie knew well what would happen
he, behrens, must think it over
he could feel a few grains of sand from the beach, still inside his buttoned boot--how lovely!
the harsh, imperious call reaches the spirit on that remote path that leads into the shadows, the coolness and peace
yet it did seem to him rather premature to begin thinking about christmas even before the advent season, six weeks at least before the holiday!
he saw not only the unerring charm which his father exer-cised upon everybody: he saw as well, with strange and  d anguished penetration, how cruelly hard it was upon him
but even as i spoke i seemed to myself unspeakably fatu- ous; and even vorse, he saw it too, apparently shared my view, and felt ashamed on my account
this gently animated quiet filled little johann with a priceless sensation: the feeling of quiet, well-cared-for, elegant repose which was the atmosphere of the resort, and which he loved better than any-thing else
tony was in no state to share his feelings
first the covers were spread, one after the other, over the chair, so that a sizable piece hung down at the foot
yes, thomas, you have very little under-standing for that sort of thing, and it's my misfortune, per-haps, that i have so much
you don’t seem to, he went on, as hans castorp continued to stare at the bizarre little instrument
he returns my bow, half gets up, finishes the last lines of a letter; then he turns to me and be-gins to talk business, looking over the top of my head
he rubbed his free hands with satisfaction and looked at the frau consul out of his kindly, light-blue eyes
his neighbour avoided contact with him
behrens asked, and fixed him with his bloodshot eyes
the hofrat said to hans castorp: castorp, old cock, you’re bored
the port of cherbourg, we could confidently trust, had been put out of com- mission by the skill of german engineers; but it surrendered after a heroic radiogram to the fuhrer from the commandant as well as the admiral
her case aptly illustrates the general mood
she should have said beforehand that she was no good to play such a game, if she had the advantage of being whispered to
so it is not possible to say that herr settembrini condemned war as such
as for settembrini, he had more than once announced his intention of changing
there vias a hasty pencilled note to her betrothed, with the words: je t'aime

- its atmosphere, a little mad and quite armless; the dec- orative appeal to the senses, the holiday and artistic mood of this self-satisfied capua: all that was of course foreign to the soul of a deep, stern nature like his
dr faustus  i: if you could just keep quiet, prating jackanapes that you are!
to the point even that he was quite capable of bringing up all three as objects of his conscientious scruples!
then he set store by rivalry and social jealousy: would tell how he had been at such and such houses, yesterday at the lange- wiesches', or whoever his friends were; or at the rollwagens', who had the two thoroughbred daughters (it always upsets me just to hear that word)
well, and salt water would naturally make a tender skin smart, so he got in the way, in the service, of rubbing in cold cream
this statement was almost as improbable as it was objectionable; but frau stöhr swore to it by all that was holy—though it was hard to understand how the poor creature could expend so much zeal and energy, and be so dogmatic, upon matters like these, when her own personal condition gave so much cause for concern
well, he said to himself, i will go over to quisisana for a bit
no, as far as knowing goes, we never can
the consul would have been nai have indeed had he not realized that the good standing of his own firm was to the advantage of his son-in-law
he never got further than being subdeacon—not even to diaconate, much less to priesthood
he was quite capable of getting out of an omnibus or train when there 'were germans in it
i can rely very ,veil on my memory, and besides i com- mitted much of it to paper at once after reading the draft, and in particular this about apostasy
a mingled odour of cologne and drugs hung in the mild, dim-lighted atmosphere
it's so little trouble that even so the pleasure might be greater
they were named gerhardt, and asserted that they descended in a direct line from paul gerhardt
oh, no, of course i don’t mean you really have—i suppose it just seemed so to me for the moment, hans castorp hastened to assure him
hans castorp broke in here
she is very luxuriously inclined, herr gr� said ir-ritably
one evening after the play, probably a little the worse for wine, the prickly but at bottom shy, inexperi- enced, and defenceless creature yielded to his practised technique of seduction and afterwards was prey to the illost scathing self- contempt
the frau consul began the conversation
he came to tea at five o'clock and said he had promised to be somewhere else between half past five and six, at the langewiesches' or rollwagens' - probably it was not true at all
for instance, the great-aunt and her charges sat once more at frau stöhr’s table, and marusja laughed as much as ever
dh, tony would furnish it to the queen's taste
i do not remember, said frau permaneder
it may well be, i like to think so, that elsewhere, in both elemy and allied countries, this short cut of fate was felt more as a catastrophe and gland nal- heur
but he was thinner and more active than his old friend, with bright little greenish eyes arid a long pointed nose
he was given over to the whims of the card-goblins, ensnared by the fitful and fickle favour of fortune, which sometimes let the face-cards and elevens pile up so that the game was over before the third tier was laid, when the fleeting triumph would stimulate the nerves to new efforts
the malay hastened to carry out his master’s will
we have told it to the end, and it was neither short nor long, but hermetic
the return to monteverdi and the style of his time is what i meant by the reconstruction of expressiveness, of ex- pressiveness in its first and original manifestation, expressiveness as lament '

her lips and even the tip of her nose were blue, probably from lack of air
the transition 'was made easy for him by his previous descrip- tions
but he promised it by this afternoon
the hofrat pretended to stagger backwards
indeed that absorbed and yearning look could only have been characterized as typically civilian
she winked and jerked her head in the direction of hans castorp, whose discomfiture she parodied with her mouth drawn down—no, illness and affliction had had no power to refine caroline stöhr; her jeers over the young man’s disappointment positively went beyond bounds
then he would look at his own hands, and their still clumsy movements, and see in them the hope foreshadowed of one day holding and using his knife and fork as grandfather did
morten lay turned toward her, his chin in his hands
a pure nature product--one knows just what one's eating
the spirit of the place, if i may put it so, is not conventional
she drew her hand back beneath her mantle, inclined her head, and turned away
the permanent accompanist of i\adame de strozzi-pecic will take over for the songs, and if only you, maitre, are simply present and show yourself to the public, nothing viii be lost, everything will be gained
but on the other hand, there were cases where this result was not obtained, could not and should not be obtained; and who, dr krokowski asked, would dare to say that these cases did not, psychically considered, form a higher, more exclusive type?
he had felt that the music was his enemy; but it had almost begun to look as if it had no such important bearing upon the situation
the connection offered you is a very good one, my dear tony

she was always longing for heaven-- finished frau permaneder, and wiped her eyes
the more discordant a chord is, the more notes it contains contrasting and conflicting with each other, the more polyphonic it is, and the more markedly every single note bears the stamp of the part already in the simultaneous sound-combina- tion
silent, silent night, in four stanzas of three lines each, the last stanza of which dismayingly enough runs: but an honest joy does itself destroy for a harlot coy
but the whole lower part of his face, longish and narrow, was neither buddenbrook nor kroner, but from the mother's side of the house
for he is a quite extraordinary personality, which by itself is something for women, and then he is hardly a civilian, like me, he is a sort of military, a bit like my poor cousin, in that he has a point d’honneur, a sore spot, as it were, which is feeling, life—i know i am talking nonsense, but i’d rather go rambling on, and partly expressing something i find it difficult to express, than to keep on transmitting faultless platitudes
faith is the vehicle of knowledge, intellect secondary
meanwhile the baying of old suso or kaschperl, jumping about and rattling his chain in front of his kennel, seemed never to stop; he became quiet only when no more guests came and the conpany had gathered in the nike salon, whither the servants hastily fetchcd chairs from the family quarters and even froin the sleeping-chambers above

he wore a cinnamon-coloured coat with wide lapels and leg-of-mutton sleeves close-fitting at the wrists, and white linen trousers with black stripes up the outside seams
frau chauchat had made special toilet for carnival, she wore a new gown, or at least one new to our hero, of thin, dark silk, probably black, or at most shot with a golden brown
perhaps he wanted to play the son of the house, to whom the warerooms were commonplace everyday; perhaps the coolness native to him in general might thus express itself; for he maintained an almost shoulder-shrugging in- difference to all these splend<?urs, replying to my admiring ex- clamations with his short laugh and a yes, very nice or funny stuff or what all do not people trunl{ of!
the other figure stood in the protecting embrace of the first, with round, youthful face, and arms and hands wound and hidden in the folds of the mantle
but who is there to denounce him?
there, so to speak, one laid one’s head back in god, and closed one’s eyes

he was a poet of distinction too, composing in his leisure tales in the most elegant tuscan prose—he was a master of the idioma gentile, settembrini said, rolling his native syllables with the utmost relish on his tongue and turning his head from side to side
that is no word for it, of course, mynheer peeperkorn, said hans castorp
her upbringing had been no more than highly correct: she had spent two years in an aristocratic girls' boarding-school il karlsruhe, patronized by the court
well, as far as that goes, i do not know about the hat--but you were certainly not much more cordial than she was, my love
what delightful, cosy times they had going to bed!
i believe i do not err in assuming our agreement in the conception of an original ideal state of man, a condition without government and without force, an unmediated condition as the child of god, in which there was neither lordship nor service, neither law nor penalty, nor sin nor relation after the flesh; no distinction of classes, no work, no property: nothing but equality, brotherhood, and moral perfectitude
but now he was startled to realize that christmas would be included in the programme—perhaps because (and yet not entirely because) he had never spent the christmas season anywhere but in the bosom of the family
they had gone down the corridor and outside the outer door, where they stood at the top of three little steps that went down to the pavement

here i have in inind what happened to her delicate and suffering sister inez, who cultivated the past and its regrets - and to poor rudi schwerdtfeger, of whon i thought with horror when i mentioned just now, almost involuntarily, the share of the recluse adrian leverktihn in these events
and his grandson, opposite, watched in silence, with deep, unconscious concentration, grandfather’s beautiful, thin, white old hands, with their pointed nails, and, on the right forefinger, the green seal ring with the crest; watched the small, deft, practised motions with which they arranged a mouthful of meat, vegetable, and potato on the end of his fork, and with a slight inclination of the head conveyed it to his mouth
so a light-year amounted to a round and net figure of six trillion miles, and the eccentricity of our solar system amounted to thirty thousand times as much, while the whole diameter of the galactic hollow ball came to two hundred thousand light-years
but a short time thereafter herr popoff, quite happy and serene, with his equally serene and happy wife, was to be seen sitting at the good russian table, finishing his meal as though nothing had happened
it will be issued in some twenty folio volumes, treating every species of human suffering, from the most personal and intimate to the great collective struggles arising from the conflicting interests of classes and nations; it will, in short, exhibit the chemical elements whose combination in various proportions results in all the ills to which our human flesh is heir
with rueful loyalty i had to reproduce a given thing; to transfer it from adrian's music-paper to my manuscript; and that i have done, not only word for word, but also, i nay' say, letter for letter - often laying down the pen to recover myself, to measure my study floor with heavy, pensive tread or to throw myself on my sofa with my hands clasped upon my brow
nonsense, tony--you and your life!
the management had done its share
listen, how would it be if we just dropped him out of our minds?
herr buddenbrook is down with erysipelas, and madame has a great deal to do, on account of the billeting
he wooed her, but in a sense for another

he confined himself to watching the gentlemen with his nose wrinkled up, in order to imitate them afterward at the club or in the family circle
and if you choose a will-o’-the-wisp to light
the husband was summoned, and informed that her stay up here would terminate only with her life
according to sister berta, she was about to die
he went on in this vein, and hans castorp listened without precisely following; first on account of his fatigue, and second because his attention was distracted by the proceedings of the lightheaded young folk on the steps
s- ing, aloof to the point of offensiveness, full of a chilling iclar
the upshot was that he kept his eye on settembrini, listened keenly and critically to what he had to say when they met on their prescribed walks to the bench on the mountain-side, or down to the platz, or wherever and whenever opportunity offered
soon after this was accomplished, in june of the same year, the young consul set out to amsterdam on a business journey the duration of which he did not know
and began the variations movement, the adagio molto semplice e cantabile
pastor pringsheim's sermon went on, turning the knife in the wound that death had made: he caused each person pres- his senses felt misty with the scent from countless bouquets and wreaths--and with another odour that came wafted now and then on a current of air, and smelled strange, yet somehow familiar
and now, shall we run through the provisions, my children?
everything gels done too slowly--so when it is finished the pleasure is already gone
a more remarkable thing, however, was that he took his sister tony aside again and again to hear in vivid detail the events buddenbrook of that fatal afternoon; for madame griinlkh had a gift of lively narration
he ate excellent meals in a spacious refectory where the rule of silence obtained—as in the corridors of the establishment—and in the centre of which a young prefect sat on a raised platform and read aloud
she was the only guest, for her daughter, who was to have gone, had visited her husband that afternoon in the prison, and felt, as she usually did, exhausted and incapable of further effort
a little time passed, some three or four weeks—this on our own reckoning, since on hans castorp’s we cannot depend
dh, heavens, how sublime that is!
it rained harder and harder; it was so dark that the first thing herr gr� did was to light the three candles on the table
-four years old; to speak of his appearance and ,vay of life as they then seemed to my al- ways anxious and observant eye
the real difference is in the look with which one pays homage to the one and to the other

he did not look at anybody or change his expression
it blesses the object, the frightfully harried formulation, with overpowering humanity, lies in parting so gently on the hearer's heart in eternal farewell that the eyes run over
herr criinlich, in his long-skirted frock-coat and silk waistcoat, waited at the door
but on what pretext?
i cannot play that, my dear lady!
t the time we were there the experience which is the basis of the manuscript lay already in the past; that adrian at that time had already had the conversation which fol- lows, amounts with me to a certainty; so does it that he vvrote it down at once after the event, presumably the very next day
i recalled what he had written from halle to kretschmar about the extension of the kingdom of the banal
and then, at her request, he gave an exposition of the existing legal grounds for divorce, and an even longer dis-course after it, which had for its subject-matter the law touching dowry rights

what it lacked in quantity it made up for in—
ah, krokowski, settembrini cried
herr settembrini, in fact, found him packing his trunk
you can look out for yourself!
no formalities with a simple man like me
how splen-did you look!
when i say streps, behrens began again, you must not picture a well-known or severe type of illness
a trait at least worthy of praise
oh, he is-- frau permaneder seemed not able to get away from this dreadful phrase
i have heard you call hofrat behrens that before, herr settembrini
thus in the inmost recesses of nature, as in an endless succession of mirrors, was reflected the macrocosm of the heavens, whose clusters, throngs, groups, and figures, paled by the brilliant moon, hung over the dazzling, frost-bound valley, above the head of our muffled adept
he was driven by his own inability to be quiet--which his fellow-burghers would have been right in ascribing to his vanity--for it was another manifestation of the same thing
but i think we are far from being well enough as we are
it might have taught me how proud i was of his general indifference, and how clearly i felt that in his it is curious, indifference became a mask

after half an hour, during which nothing was heard but the scratching of pens and the sound of herr marcus discreetly clearing his throat, the consul looked over the green half-blind and saw christian coming down the street
i don’t know, really, herr settembrini
when he came home for the holidays, very clean, very well dressed, with a little red-blond moustache that became his sleepy, young patrician face, obviously en route to a considerable position in life, people looked at him, the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community and made it their business to know all about family and social relations—and that, in a self-governing city-state, meant most of the population—they looked him well over, his fellow citizens, and asked themselves what public rôle young castorp was destined to fill
my dear friend—irreproachable, very
hermetics—what a lovely word, herr naphta!
they all sat spellbound, and when quiet was restored outside, zur bohe raised his voice again in his dogmatic beautiful!

in- deed, my mind misgives me that  shall only be awakening the reader's doubt whether he is in the right hands: whether, i mean, my whole existence does not disqualify me for a task dictated by my heart rather than by any true competence for the work
should i admire your mockery?
that’s good too, laughed hans castorp
dr krokowski strode over to the wall and switched on the ceiling lamp; the light flashed up glaringly, making them all blink
hush, wehsal, hush, the coachman can understand you
then, in a voice appropriately subdued, he began a conversation with the widow, eliciting information about the sufferings, the last days and moments of her departed husband, and the arrangements for transporting the body to carinthia; displaying a sympathy and conversance that was in part physicianly, in part priestly and moralizing
but he was not very popular
frau antonie criinlich stood proudly in the doorway, behind her the two servant-maids, with white caps, bare arms, and thick striped skirts--she had engaged them beforehand for her sister-in-law
it was prob- ably an unjust reproach, for he had not necessarily got in at the same time with inez
it had with death certain relations, which one might love, yet not without consciously, and in a stocktaking sense, acknowledging a certain illicit element in one’s love
the projecting fronts of some of the houses jutted out into the roadway; others had porticos or raised benches added on

he may even have muttered some abusive epithet between his teeth, some outraged cry of protest
his active years had fallen in a decade of rapid growth and repeated upheavals, a decade of progress by forced marches, which had made continual demands on the public capacity for enterprise and self-sacrifice
but your bl dei is after all- or not after all, i beg pardon, i mean before all - a part of this abominable nature - ,vith a not very generous quan- tum of potential spirituality
hans castorp lent an ear to the learned strife between ovists and animalculists: the first of whom asserted that the egg was in itself the complete little frog, dog, or human being, the male element being only the incitement to its growth; while the second saw in a spermatozoon, possessing head, arms, and legs, the perfected form of life shadowed forth, to which the egg performed only the office of nourisher in life’s feast
they walked in this hushed, whispering peacefulness by the sea, whose every faint murmur, near or far, seemed to have a deep significance

and there was also more than one of its opposite number among the wood-wind instruments, the contra-bassoon, sixteen- foot likewise - in other words, sounding an octave lower than the notes indicate - mightily strengthening the basses, built in twice the dimensions of its smaller brother the humorous bassoon, to which i give that name because it is a bass instrument without proper bass strength, oddly weak in sound, bleating, burlesque

o lord, lead us and guide us all, so long as we live upon this earth the pen hurried glibly over the paper, with here and there a commercial flourish, talking with god in every line
both of them, behrens no less than joachim, looked at him amazed—was he not ashamed of this confused, impromptu harangue?
there were four glass doors, two on the opposite wall, opening on the verandah, a third at the bottom of the room on the left, leading into the front hall, and a fourth, by which hans castorp had entered through a vestibule, as joachim had brought him down a different stair from the one they had used yesterday evening

an enormous brick-red boiled ham appeared, strewn with crumbs and served with a sour brown onion sauce, and so many vegetables that the company could have satisfied their appetites from that one vegetable-dish

but i protest against them with my whole sense of justice as a christian and a business man

he had an odd name for the serious mental preoccupations which absorbed him in his picturesque retreat; he called them taking stock; the expression, crude as it was, defined for him an employment which he loved, even though it was bound up in his mind with the phenomena of fear and giddiness and palpitation, and made his face burn even more than its wont
such was the immediate view—wearisome to move in, quaintly, roguishly stimulating to the fancy

evening parties, blissfully absorbed in flirtation with the other sex, young girls as well as more mature women
but then, what he had said, quite unblushingly and without embarrassment, to his wife, was this: tonerl--he called her tonerl--tonerl, that's good enough for me

he, not settembrini, was in reality the free-thinker, the man who looked for guidance within himself
you won’t be able to hear yourselves think—mark my words
he would say, just as when he went to bed
this he called a compronise for home use, as also the tempered piano was a thing precisely for domestic con- sumption, a transient peace-pact, not a hundred and fifty years old, which had brought to pass all sorts of considerable things, oh, very considerable, but about which we should not imagine that everything was settled for eternity
when hans castorp stirred again, the mountains would be wholly lost in a cloud of snow; only a pinnacle, a jutting rock, might show one instant, to be rapt away the next
that is sentimental, as you say
but it was impossible; the hofrat said poor little gerngross could not stand the journey

then hanno stayed in the salon of thr kuihuusk and played on the little piano that was used to play waltzes and schotlisches for the balls and was not so good for improvising on as the piano at home: still one could some- times get amusing effects out of its muffled and clacking keys

he parried them by thanking her for having come so quickly, saying it was splendid to have her, and how delighted joachim would be
dr dverdieck, the burgomaster, was saying so just now
rudolf had not even taken off his short fur jacket, and adrian had put on his camel's-hair ulster
but it's you we are talking about, tom!

and as the fœtal slime condensed into fibrous connective tissue, into cartilage, the colloidal cells beginning to show gelatinous substance instead of mucin, he saw in certain places the connective tissue take lime and fat to itself out of the sera that washed it, and begin to form bone
it vas as though clarissa saw in rudolf the sort of suitor 'who had to hop; and in fact he constantly, in the most naive way, confidingly and unabashedly sued for adrian's favour

dr grabow's treatment consisted of giving fruit-juice before the child went to bed; which had absolutely no effect
stamping, shuffling, with a confusion of masculine voices, treble and falsetto, they flooded up the steps and over the corridor
dr faustus  a vast impropriety like this of the exploding universe?
yes, he went on, after a pause for effect, you may well open your eyes—hans castorp had done nothing of the sort, merely blinked at him rather sleepy and distraught—of course you haven’t an idea how old behrens can say such a thing
then everything would be put right and the stain wiped out
almost in the same second the girl vanished, and there was herr permaneder left standing before his wife, with drooping head, drooping arms, drooping moustaches too; and all he could get out was some idiotic remark like holy cross, what a mess!
after a reflective pause my friend went on: believe not, dear brothers and sisters, that for the promission and conclusion of the pact a crosse way in the wood, many circles and impure conjuration were needed, since already st thomas teacheth that for falling away there needs not words with which invocation takes place, rather any act be enough, even without express allegiance
as adrian's childhood intimate, and of course because, although not a theologian, i seemed to dis- playa decided interest in the field of religious study, i was wel- comed into the guest circle of the christian society winfried and permitted to share in the excursions made by the group in order to enjoy the beauty of god's green creation

that i fear for you i do not deny
perhaps they’ll play that thing from carmen—what’s the matter?
you do not make a violent effort, of course, because you are tired from your work
and when he left it, the fresh underwear on his body, the faultless ele-gance of hib clothing, the smell of the brilliantine on his moustache, and the cool, astringent taste of the mouth-wash he used--all this gave him a feeling of satisfaction and buddenbrddk adequacy, like that of an actor who has adjusted every detail of his costume and make-up and now steps out upon the stage
frau permaneder stood up and embraced her brother

pastor pringsheini began to speak
that is why there is so much discipline and decorum and regularity in the army, so much spanish etiquette,  if i may say so; and it makes no great difference whether one wears a uniform collar or a starched ruff, the main thing is the asceticism, as you so beautifully said—i don’t know if i’ve succeeded in making my train of thought quite—

but in the devoutness of her prayer, she thought only of the words as they welled up from her heart, and forgot that she did not know the whole stanza; after the third line she was left hanging in the air, and had to make up for her abrupt end by the increased dignity of her manner

joachim found him still lying when he entered at eleven o’clock at sound of the gong for second breakfast

but now it is a rather different state of affairs: i have been examined, and hofrat behrens told me in so many words that it would be no good my going home, i should only have to come back again; and that if i stopped down there, the whole lobe would be at the devil before you could say jack robinson
this morning, while my good i-ielene was preparing our morning drink and a brisk upper bavarian autumn day began to clear away the usual early mists, i read in illy paper of the successful revival of our subnarine vvarfare, to which inside twenty-four hours not less than twelve ships, among them two large passen- ger steamers, an english and a brazilian, \\jtith five hundred pas- sengers, have fallen victim

you could not trust those eyes

i saw it in your face as i came up
dh, nothing can compete with a dung-heap, for smell, dohlmann said, with a deliberately coarse pronunciation, which must have depressed everybody's spirits the more by  its hopeless cynicism

up to now it had been only the pupils who were ex-amined, but now it was the master as well
alfred lauritzen, with his big feet and his boatswain's face--it is offensive to me to think of him in the senate-house
customs, rates, construction, railways, posts, almonry--all this as well as his own business occupied him; and even in matters commonly left to profes-sionals he acquired insight and judgment, especially in finance, where he early showed himself extremely gifted- he was careful not to neglect the social side
then he said, in an oddly faltering and neutral voice: no, i did not know that - about your feelings nor about the tea
clarissa lay ,vith open eyes on the sofa at the foot of the bed, a piece from the seventies or eighties of the last century, with a back and side arm; i knew it from the rambergstrasse
the advance of the muscovites into our destined granary, the ukraine, and the elastic retreat of our troops to the dnieper line accompanied my work, or rather my work accompanied those events

a fantastic hope rose up in him, inspired by the belief that nothing was impossible to cod--despite all the worsted-coated men there were in the world

it has been levelled at the characteristic feature of the work, its combination of very new and very old; but surely this is by no means an arbi- trary combination; rather it lies in the nature of things: it rests, i might say, on the curvature of the ,vorld, which makes the last return unto the first

it must be said that hans castorp’s sentiments toward the patient of the good russian table had made distinct progress during his retirement

but as sascha and his mother went in, and hans castorp gazed after them, the corridor door opened, and the next patient entered the waiting-room—she was, of course, too early, on account of the delay in the laboratory
you have not let me finish, or you would have heard that i am ready and willing to meet you in the circumstances, and add ten thousand marks to the seventy thousand without more ado
the old pair bent over the cradle side by side and watched the slumbering child; and the consul's wife lay pale and happy, in an exquisite lace jacket, her hair carefully dressed

it would be very irresponsible of either of us to do that
he was standing in the middle of the room, in his white smock, holding the black stethoscope in his hand and tapping his thigh with it
he went on with perfect fluency

tuberculosis is the most long-winded thing in the world; but affections of this sort can be cured very quickly to-day; if you react to the inoculations, you will be as sound as a bell inside six weeks

but his grandfather had had his finger in the forming of governments; he had conspired against austria and the holy alliance, which had dismembered his native land and then held it in the heavy bond of servitude; he had been a zealous member of certain secret societies that had spread over italy—a carbonaro, settembrini explained, suddenly dropping his voice, as though it might still be dangerous to utter the word

she recognized it as a fact, since everybody else believed it--and she utilized it to her own advantage, talking of it and making herself great with it in her own eyes and those of others

do take some—no, you won’t be robbing me, i have heaps of it in my room, eight boxes, and five tablets of gala-peter and four pounds of lindt
what was his feeble pipe, after the rolling thunder of jove?
but hardly had they said good-bye and consul hagenstrom turned with his companion to walk down the street, when it was seen that a very lively con-versation began at once between the two
thank cod, he thought, now it ca not last long
as your stay up here with us does not appear to be conducive, as you don’t feel comfortable, either physically or, unless i err, mentally, how would it be if you renounced the prospect of growing older on this spot—in short, what if you were to pack to-night, and be up and away with the first suitable train?
i mean to ask settembrini if he hears anything about them nowadays
and ,ve offer better, we offer only the right and true - that is no lenger the classical, my friend, what we give to experience, it is the archaic, the primeval, that which long since has not been tried
the prolonged shrill ringing which was the signal for morning prayers struck on his ear while he was still twenty paces from the long red wall with the two cast-iron gates, which separated the court of the school-building from the street
but among the solid, respectable citizens there was much head-shaking
upon the anecdote - to use a very objective word - everything focuses; it stands in the background from the beginning on, announces itself in the first lines and is postponed
it was the elemental in mu- sic or music and the elemental or the elements of music or something like that
the substance composing the brain and marrow was so subject to disintegration, there was no hope whatever of determining its structure
()ne side of his cheek was drawn up in a sort of tic, the corner of the mouth as well, and the eye winked in sympathy; the ,hole expression was crabbed and craven to a degree; he looked no-good, he looked odious
ah, papa, she said softly, almost without moving her lips, would not it have been better--?
what have you measured to-day?
he said that being virtuous and healthy did not, in fact, constitute being in a state of religion at all
he had never, like his sister tony, flung himself across the table sobbing like a child; and he shrank from hearing the heart-broken words in which madame gr�, from roast to dessert, loved to celebrate the character and person of her dead father
he liked the darkness, it mitigated the queerness of the situation
those were his words, though of course it sounded much more plastic and literary as he said it
a man who stands firm and confident in his own calling, whatever it may be, recog-nizes only it, understands only it, values only it
it seemed to him that anger was no longer in place; he even had an obscure feeling that he was partly responsible, that he shared the blame with her before the others
but joachim answered that nobody knew whether the hofrat was still a patient—he was probably long since cured
on the otlut hand, he was doing the hard-pressed land-owner a fivour which he was called upon to do, by reason of tony's con-nection with the maibooms
of the st matthew passion
then he began to employ himself silently with the class register, holding his pen in a way that was incomparably correct, with the slender fingers out-stretched; while about him people yawned, laughed, conned their lessons, and chattered half aloud
i am in my third year up here—i’m sick of it, fed up, i can’t play the game any more—do you blame me for that?
i stood at his father's side in the ', when, with a word, he tamed the unleashed fury of the mob
and tinally fate overtook her and put to shame her contemptuous \\tay of looking down her nose
johann buddenbrook thanked them all for their kindness, first as head of the family and then as senior partner of the firm--and sent thomas for another bottle of malmsey
thoughts that had to do with madame chauchat’s recklessness and abandon, her ailing state, the heightening and accentuation of her physical parts by disease, the corporealization, so to speak, of all her being as an effect of disease—an effect in which he, hans castorp, by the physician’s verdict, was now to share
if i get only one more bad mark, i sha not go up, said johann; and i am sure to get it when i am called up for latin
he cleared his throat by way of testing his voice; then he coughed
i felt, of course, vexed and in
and how it would hurt me!
settembrini said his joviality is forced, and one must admit that settembrini has his own views and knows whereof he speaks
joachim said more than once in these days, let us hope it has done you good to be up here, and that you will feel the benefit when you are at home again
i had to sell no very small quantity of grain not very advantageously--or, rather, i had to sell a large quantity very much at a loss
an educational system which still conceives itself as a child of the age of enlightenment, with criticism as its chosen medium of instruction, the liberation and cult of the ego the solvent of forms of life which are absolutely fixed—such a system may still, for a time, reap an empty rhetorical advantage; but its reactionary character is, to the initiated, clear beyond any doubt all educational organizations worthy of the name have always recognized what must be the ultimate and significant principle of pedagogy: namely the absolute mandate, the iron bond, discipline, sacrifice, the renunciation of the ego, the curbing of the personality
it happened when he was a lad of thirteen, in knee-breeches, in the lower third form at school
there is a but in your tone, herr settembrini
that expression he wore, as of something bad-tasting in the mouth, had grown more and more pronounced
maria, he felt, made a sort of bond between him, the exile, and his home in the flat-land—a bond more effectual than the postcards he now and then sent to his uncle, the intervals between which grew longer in proportion as he imbibed the more spacious time conceptions prevalent up here
even anton had left the house, and gone over to the; young pair, where he was more needed
now i must tell you a little story
what difficulties would he not have, to acclimatize himself?
but that he does fight, rejoined naphta, remains the distinctive feature of his existence as a soldier
we shall take you at your word
she received him alone, in the middle corridor room on the first floor, where a fire was laid, and she had arranged a heavy table with ink and writing materials and a quantity of foolscap paper from the of-fice
hermine kleefeld leaned against herr albin’s shoulder as she held her glass to be filled
there is such a lack of modesty in so much communicativeness
anyhow that is a very nice point - in more than one sense of the ,vord
two children, a son and a daughter, had been born; then they had brought her up here, the fragile body already fever-smitten; a few months had seen the completion of the wasting-away process
she asserted that some of them had tears running down into their beards
you usually take your jokes more seriously than your seriousness
frau stöhr whimpered that she would like to stop, but they told her she should have thought of that before, she must just keep quiet now
his head-piece sustained without undue strain the demands made upon it by the course at the realgymnasium—strain, indeed, was something to which he was quite definitely disinclined, whatever the circumstances or the object of his effort; less out of fear of hurting himself than because he positively saw no reason, or, more precisely, saw no positive reason, for exertion
at that rime, unlike adrian, who when he had spent the evening in munich used to stick to his eleven-o'clock train back to pfeiffering, i had rented a room in schwabing, hohenzollernstrasse, not far behind the siegesthor, in order to be independent and on occasion to have a roof over my head in the city
as she did not own a single sou, she knew that she would find nobody in all the wide world to marry her, and she looked with humility into her future, which would surely consist of consuming a tiny in-come in some tiny room which her influential uncle would procure for her out of the funds of some charitable establishment for maidens of good family
say what you like—and there was a lot to be said for the idea that illness had something solemn and ennobling about it—yet after all, you couldn’t deny that illness was an accentuation of the physical, it did throw man back, so to speak, upon the flesh and to that extent was detrimental to human dignity
the nerves controlling the blood-vessels that supplied his face functioned so well that the skin, robbed of all its blood, went quite cold, the nose looked peaked, and the hollows beneath the young eyes were lead-coloured as any corpse’s
will you permit me to ask how old you are?
your most obedient servant, as they say in halle
you can shut your fist, you see
i am not so anxious to undertake anything for the moment
he was gnawed by chagrin at the insult that had been offered him, and he stared, weary and chilled, at the cushions opposite
he longed to flee—as we have seen already
not yet, hans castorp answered
he was questioned, not ignored, as had so long been the case, to his slight and concealed but daily recurring annoyance
and the cosmopolitanism of the institution prevented his race from being perceptible
it could only add to its authority and its awfulness
quite suddenly he found himself in the far distant past, transported to a scene which had come back to him in a dream some nights before, summoned by certain impressions of the last few days
pieter peeperkorn lay in one of the two; its red satin coverlet was strewn with papers, books, and letters, and he was reading the telegraaf through his horn-rimmed pince-nez with the high nose-piece
and as she looked at him—with her narrow, blue-grey eyes above the broad cheek-bones—he tore himself by violence away from his dream, for now he had it fast and meant to hold it, of what and whom she so vividly reminded him
peeperkorn raged at the precipitate breaking-up of the festivities, in kingly choler struck the table with his fist and called after the retreating cowardly slaves—but allowed frau chauchat and hans castorp to calm him with the consideration that the banquet had already lasted some six hours, and must in any case some time come to an end
well, if you like to call it that--but what i call it is a disgrace, a slap in the face; because that is just what it would be
his age would have been hard to say, probably between thirty and forty; for though he gave an impression of youthfulness, yet the hair on his temples was sprinkled with silver and gone quite thin on his head
with pleasure, he said
he was not ambitious for expert skill, and all he needed he acquired in a few days, without undue strain on wind or muscles
as i said, i have a number of affairs on hand
well, he declared, i am certainly far from feeling fit up here
he felt put out; his voice vibrated with ill humour as he answered to his cousin’s knock on the wall; and he appeared to joachim on his entrance like anything but a man refreshed and invigorated by a good night’s sleep
if winter consists in darkness and cold, snow and hot pipes, then there’s no denying it’s winter again
no, i left long ago
but to measure one’s own private time, that time which for the individual in these parts was so closely bound up with space—that was held to be an occupation only fit for new arrivals and short-termers
today it can be done, but it is only just playable, and in his time it was simply not
you have made a position for yourself in life; and there you stand, and push everything away which might possibly disturb your equi-librium for a moment--for your equilibrium is the most precious thing in the world to you
she was a failure or at least lacking any genuine success, for the simple reason, so hard for the person con- cerned to grasp, that her natural talent was not equal to her am- bition
for she had wished to marry, she had so longed to marry and live, and she had done it: healed and sound she had wedded her dear husband, himself as sound as a berry, who on his side had no notion at all of such things
it said: com-mit your ways unto the lord
we should all nf us be just the same
and end is come, the end is come, it watcheth for thee, be- hold, it is come
sometimes the hofrat would appear, and perform his stunt with the bootlaces
if you only feel that i spoke in good part--you do, do not you?
but now, here he was--he stood before her
everything is so queer
it was not his fault; he had held far more with ancestral ways and old institutions than with ruinous schemes for widening the harbour, or godless and rubbishing plans for a great metropolis
settembrini made difficulties—there were difficulties, he said
he was only looking with fixed gaze back into his own past life and at life in gen-eral
you answered with such assurance—
she sat down in a chair and stopped there without moving
i love the angelic in his figure, which reminds me of shelley: the peculiarly and very inysteriously veiled, unapproachable, withdrawing, un- adventurous flavour of his being, that not ,vanting to know, that rejection of material experience, the sublime incest of his fantas- tically delicate and seductive art
have they whipped him yet?
totally anæmic, as i was saying
he felt his heart give a sudden beat—without rhyme or reason, of its own accord, as it had taken to doing up here
moreover, there were preparations to be made for his reception
oh, nothing very good, tom
he spent his time in preparations; settled his last account with the management, and days ahead of time began to pack
i remember it like yesterday
it reminded him of the colour of certain eyes, whose shape and glance had spelled his destiny; eyes to which herr settembrini, from his humanistic height, had referred with contempt as tartar slits and wolf’s eyes—eyes seen long ago and then found again, the eyes of pribislav hippe and clavdia chauchat
and his aversion from it, a matter of taste, an aesthetic revulsion, a reaction of human pride— if we may use such large words in connexion with our modest hero—was almost as great as his curiosity
do you see it, young man?
ida jungmann sat, white-haired, bright-eyed, and angular, opposite hanno on the back seat, and he squeezed his head into the corner and looked past her out of the window
or two months nepomul{ had been the joy of the house
before i forget it, he said abruptly, you may introduce me to the lady in the garden if you like, i mean if it happens that way, i have no objection
now, if the life about him, if his own time seem, however outwardly stimulating, to be at bottom empty of such food for his aspirations; if he privately recognize it to be hopeless, viewless, helpless, opposing only a hollow silence to all the questions man puts, consciously or unconsciously, yet somehow, puts, as to the final, absolute, and abstract meaning in all his efforts and activities; then, in such a case, a certain laming of the personality is bound to occur, the more inevitably the more upright the character in question; a sort of palsy, as it were, which may even extend from his spiritual and moral over into his physical and organic part
he would soon eat again, this young mar,
they are expecting me in amsterdam
they are throwing stones--i have had enough of that
then, interrupting himself loudly, as if tony should hear only this part, he added, i beg you, hold that position!
the harvest, the entire harvest of pöppenrade?
oh, please, buddenbrook, grätjens began, bending over the table and taking careful aim, waving the cue back and forth in his bony hand, a customs union—i don’t understand
all the krögers have been partial to luxury
they have so many interests in common, sometimes even relatives
because the molecule was made up of atoms, and the atom was not even close to being large enough to be called extraordinarily small
that helped—it was chivalrous and humane of herr settembrini
dr langhals had gone home for a while, but when he returned he found everything as before
all this, however, did not prevent hans castorp from gaining two distinct impressions from his arrival
that will be sad, but since the sphere of my work is of the freest, most purely intellectual sort, it will not prevent me from serving the cause of humankind, from defying the spirit of disease to my last dying breath
and then, in a low voice, he implored herr buddenbrook to sit still and open his mouth wide—and went to work
i do not despise you
you were very cocky with your answers that day
pausing in the smoking room for a cigarette after second breakfast, he had found it tucked in a corner of the bookshelf, behind a row of sturdy tomes, and recalled that he had bought it casually on sale at a bookshop years ago—a rather thick volume, poorly bound and badly printed on thin, yellowed paper, just the second half of a famous metaphysical system
it’s not dangerous, as far as i know, but a stubborn case and it keeps recurring
what we lack is precisely that, the naivete, and that deficiency, if one may call it that, protects us from many a colorful barbarism that would be quite compatible with culture, with very high culture indeed
after such exaltation, his sudden reward was radical gloom, a hangover that bordered on despair
the church, in which that view has survived, has chosen to do battle, in a humanistic spirit, with astronomical knowledge, has declared it the devil's work, has forbidden it in honor of man, has insisted on ignorance out of humaneness
someone was supposed to say, go!—except no one had recalled that it was the neutral party’s task to issue this dreadful invitation, or at least no one had mentioned it
and just then a fly settled on the inert forehead and began to move its proboscis up and down
from then on joachim assumed a permanent horizontal position, and hans castorp wrote to luise ziemssen about it—wrote to her from his splendid lounge chair that he must now add to his earlier occasional reports the news that joachim was bedfast and that although his cousin had said nothing, one could see in his eyes that it was his wish to have his mother beside him, and that director behrens had expressly seconded this unspoken wish
he strove to give the impression of being a wild, handsome, scheming devil, to play the role of a wicked, crafty, interesting villain, somewhere between mephistopheles and napoleon—and he pulled it off rather well
any other feelings i may have must be left unstated
the horrors that have just been heard are now transported, with fully different instrumentation and restructured rhythms, into a totally different register by this indescribable children's chorus
with obvious relish, indeed with open praise, he dined on layer cake, each narrow, curving slice of which was richly veined with chocolate
no, things can’t go on like this
it was impossible, he said, to concern oneself with something done, when one was now in a state of being incapable of doing anything better; the past was only bearable if one felt superior to it, instead of having to stare stupidly at it in the awareness of one's pres�nt impotence
but that was not all; what distressed him was no longer simply the worry about his son’s or his firm’s future
war, settembrini exclaimed, even war, my dear sir, has on occasion been forced to serve progress—as you yourself must grant me, if you will recall certain events from your own favorite epoch, by which i mean the crusades
hans castorp cried, and now hilarity got the better of him
then he got up again
as far as i know, you’re in agreement with mama’s wish, aren’t you?
so you would have agreed had i left it at that?
i’m telling you—be careful
on the way to the opera, it was
on the coming sunday he would be present for another of the regular fortnightly band concerts, and on monday he would likewise attend another of dr krokowski’s fortnightly lectures—or so he said to himself and to joachim
she’d never think of it
it turned out that on that very same morning, in new jersey, her sister sophie had died of inflammation of the heart
and he spoke of joachim’s general disgust and plans to depart—and made sure to add that one would doubtless be doing the engineer a disservice if one did not ascribe to him the same impatience to return to his work
followed by other guests emerging from the social rooms, two curious figures now made their entrance—they had apparently only just finished with their costumes
ah, as secretly as it came, the silent magic died
hanno let go of his knee, which he had been holding fast until now
the body doesn’t give a damn about the meaning of the stimulus
dressed in his danish sailor outfit, with white trim at the neck and a thick knotted sailor’s tie fluffed at the wide linen collar, he leaned against the piano, crossing his thin legs, his head and upper body turned slightly to one side in a pose that was both shy and full of an unconscious grace
by which we do not mean to cast any aspersions whatever against the so-called bad russian table
he fell silent, and tony was silent, too
someone pulled the window curtains back and blew out the candles
but so much the better, then, if academic life keeps one young, which means: preserves a loyalty to the mind, to free thought, to higher interpretation of the crude event
i can wait no longer
but do you still love me at all?
he pulled out the pony, looked at it as if he had some putrid piece of garbage in his hand, slipped it into his pocket, and disdainfully tossed petersen’s ovid back on his desk
and then he put a stop to those great forces
and sister leandra came
was this artificial return mere playacting?
hermine kleefeld was part of the group, as was herr albin, who passed around a large flowered box of chocolates from which all the others ate, whereas he did not touch them, but instead assumed a paternal air and smoked gold-tipped cigarettes
he sat down beside hanno buddenbrook, smiled softly—and a little slyly—and said good morning to his neighbor, adopting the current slang by contracting the greeting to a sassy, casual monosyllable
it had all contributed to making his existence what it was: artificial, self-conscious, and forced—until every word, every gesture, the slightest deed in the presence of others had become a taxing and grueling part in a play
yes, thank god, that did us some good
c'est l'heure exquise ; another is the equally magical chanson d'automne ; a third, fantastically melancholy and maddeningly melodic, has three stanzas that open with: un grand sommeil noir-tombe sur ma vie
but first, what is your name?
i presume that’s what you had in mind in asking
from the slope on his right, a mountain stream swept along a flat, stony bed, then rushed foaming over terraced boulders in its path, and finally flowed more serenely toward the valley, crossed at that point by a picturesque wooden bridge with simple railings
i am confident that, by dint of your own hard work, you have proved yourself worthy of the accommodating spirit he has shown and that you will continue to do so
and with that, this part of hans castorp’s life came to an end as well, and a very short time later he changed homes and neighborhoods—for the second time now in his young life
for whereas lodovico, as he himself reported with bitterness, found himself restricted to deriding life and manners at the international sanatorium berghof, to offering his sardonic criticism and protesting in the name of beautiful, vigorous humanity, his grandfather had given governments trouble, had conspired against austria and the holy alliance, which in those days held his dismembered fatherland in the grip of darkest bondage, and had been a zealous member of certain secret societies that had spread throughout italy—a carbonaro, as settembrini suddenly declared, lowering his voice, as if it were still dangerous even now to speak the word
king solomon in all his glory
our only explanation is that there was something shrewdly life-affirming in our hero’s nature, which allowed him to find everything worth listening to and which one might also call obligingness, in the sense that it not only bound him to very different kinds of people and personalities, but also to some extent linked them to one another
in d that the
that history had in fact been one of the progressive application of human reason, by which, on the basis of purely rational concerns, god had gradually been removed from the administration of justice
jump; and in fact he was forever trying to win adrian's favor in the most naive fashion, undauntable in his confiding familiarity
please excuse me, i am very busy
he took the liberty of remaining seated, because that created a handsomer effect, and, with the addition of just a few chivalrous gestures of hands and head, he toasted the two ladies of the house, madame antoinette and the consul’s wife
have you heard the latest, bethsy?
and when i first took communion at my confirmation, it came in waves—the tingling and prickling just wouldn’t stop
and while joachim gasped behind his napkin and frau magnus, his neighbor, pounded on his back in the time-honored fashion, the cousins’ eyes met in a way that frightened hans castorp even more than the incident itself, which of course could happen to anyone; and then joachim lowered his eyes, hid his face in his napkin, and left the table and the dining hall to cough himself out elsewhere
and dr langhals turned his beautiful eyes away, inspected his fingernails, and remarked how impossible it was for a frail human to answer the question whether frau permaneder’s brother would survive the night or be called to his reward within the next few minutes
most dissonances, he says, have more likely come into harmony by way of melody than through any harmonic combination
the lentil-sized red spots on the chest and stomach have multiplied
the midwife was questioned as well, but she stubbornly denied it
he deserts to the colors, hans castorp said dreamily
it was almost impossible to engage joachim’s interest in these matters, since he thought of nothing—as hans castorp had himself noted one evening in french—except being a soldier down in the plains, and lived in increasingly bitter conflict with his hopes, which teased him by now drawing nearer, now vanishing into the distance
there was a constant coming and going
i don’t really know how to put it
a gift more rare than precious stone
christian was in much the same state as poor klothilde
but was it not, perhaps, all for the good?
hell’s bells, ’m lookin’ for ’ard to that, herr permaneder shouted, turning his whole easy chair around to face the door
keep still and just let your head hang low if it’s so heavy
you can tell even when he’s a young man that there’s something to him
i find it peculiar, he said gloomily, pointing with his wrinkled-up nose at his bony, badly bowed leg and scrawny knee, which made a woebegone knob in his white underwear
his truncated musical coffin, inside which the song decayed into some electrical gramophone music
although since it is always the same day, it is surely not correct to speak of repetition
explicitly remarked that this critique must necessarily turn against traditional forms and genres of art-for instance, against the aesthetic kind of theater that had been part of the bourgeois circle of life, an occasion for its refinement?
she pulled her blanket up and gazed dreamily at the ceiling
i had barely put my pen to paper when a word flowed from it that is already the source of some personal discomfiture: the word genius,
shortly thereafter the newlyweds drove off with old thomas to the station in weissenfels, there to board a train for their trip to dresden, while the wedding guests spent several hours together over frau luder's fine fruit liqueurs
and not the elm, whose branches stirred beneath his window and to whose wonderful fragrance when it bloomed, in the same season as his own birth, he seemed to show some response
and if she should, it would somehow be as horrifying as if she had crawled out of her coffin
and roar he did, declaring everything naphta had said to be chicanery, humbug, confusion
well, they’re married, for heaven’s sake, that’s as it should be at least
only love, and not reason, yields kind thoughts
i value the courtesy of your modest phrases
you are coming along, are not you ?
also a divorced romanian authoress from transylvania, who had written several comedies and maintained a bohemian salon in schwabing; plus rosa zwitscher, an actress from the hoftheater, whose performances often had a grand nervous intensity-and one or two other female figures who need not be characterized, particularly since i am not certain in every case of their active membership in the club
no one could fail to notice his emotion-including the child
that regales, he said
heavens, how right you are
there was a chamber music series: quartets and trios; instrumental solos for violin, cello, and flute; concert pieces with violin or flute obligato; solo piano works
that is how we humans are
had it dedicated to you ?
atop the well—she went on reading—which i can see from my window, is a madonna, and sometimes they crown her with wreaths, and then the common people kneel down with their rosaries and pray, which really looks quite pretty, but it is written: enter into thy closet
and each time rascal luck tickled their nerves, there would be a moment of exaltation or despair, an eruption of anger or a hysterical fit of laughter, and all their outbursts were in genuine earnest and would have sounded no different had these been the ups and downs in life’s fortunes
that was not their way
one day a package arrived from hamburg, where she had ordered several things, and it contained a dressing gown—trimmed, this time, not with velvet, of course, but with little cotton bows
is it the case that our intentions are at cross purposes, that you wanted to ask her to be your wife?
they would certainly not have it so good
but after dr grabow’s brief but serious conversation with the consul on the stairs, after consultation with a second doctor—a newcomer to town, a stout man with a black beard and a gloomy expression—who now began to arrive and leave with grabow, the physiognomy of the household changed, so to speak
that way, i thought, only the stars would be left
he treated adrian, on whom he had cast a vaguely expectant eye, very much like his own son and enjoyed having a family member round out his table, which had so long consisted of only the aforementioned frau butze and, by a patriarchal gesture, his apprentice luca
there was something absolutely repulsive about the boy, but herr ballerstedt praised him for his efforts
and with that, she began dripping honey on her slice of country bread
yes, that’s the popular understanding
there was a splendid party on the eve of the wedding, to which half the town was invited
and whistled—no, that was just too crazy!
assez, christian, madame buddenbrook said
ah, that’s tous-les-deux, he said
it was a brawl, an unseemly and indecent wrestling match, between babette the cook and herr permaneder
i do understand that you don’t always want to turn your head to watch
tony, her mouth full of bread and butter, looked at her father, then at her mother, with a mixture of curiosity and alarm
into that volume had been inserted a note, written in an unknown hand, with the dictum:
if someone wants something from you, she seemed to want to say, you jump
i most certainly do not have a pony
leverkiihn attended these shows and, as i noticed, also studied literature on the very ingenious hand puppets and shadow plays of the javanese
the director, his neck arched, was just rowing off toward home; hans castorp broke into a trot, even took the freedom of shouting—but got no response
there she stood, victorious in the good fight that she had waged all her life against the onslaughts of reason
and when these good things arrived, he greeted them with gusto, rubbing his hands and attempting to share his emotions in a few words that broke off impressively, but nevertheless proved quite effective, at least as a general display of personality
making use of exhaustive and graphic detail in an effort to be understood, he was able to describe, however, a horrible anomaly which he had noticed of late, the nature of which was that on certain days—depending on the weather and his mood—he could not look at an open window without being overcome, for no reason whatever, by the urge to leap out of it—a savage instinct, a kind of mad and desperate foolhardiness that he found almost impossible to suppress
how does one burst the cocoon and become a butterfly?
not long before, about a week after new year—and it must be kept in mind that while we tell our story, the silent, restless current of time sweeps on—news spread at breakfast that the bath attendant had found them that morning lying on their beds still in wrinkled evening clothes
and yet, at moments when no one had so much as mentioned his dead father, tears would slowly fill his eyes—with no change at all in his facial expression
god took her, and the buddenbrooks received a lot of money, a nice round sum of one hundred thousand thalers courant, which increased the firm’s working capital in a most timely fashion
heaven knows, the mattress is just seaweed—we’re simple folk
yes, there’s no mistaking that whiff of spookiness
the imitation was convincing, full of passion and subterfuge, irresistibly comic, with a touch of the eccentric burlesque that the english and americans do so well—yet never for a moment unpleasant, because christian was enjoying himself much too much
as always, patients had gathered to watch the departure: frau iltis of the stirletto, fräulein levi of the ivory complexion, drastic herr popóv and his wife
edgar—that was lüders, fat lüders, there, by the window, the letter l, and it wasn’t even close to being his turn
i mean the world is normally arranged so that it meets people’s needs and is salutary to their love of life, there’s no denying that
generally speaking, the females seemed less endangered in this regard
what he had wanted from
a swallow fluttered so low over the street that its wings seemed to brush the cobblestones
i discovered that he was increasingly preoccupied with an interest in music wedded to word, with its vocal articulation; he was engaged now almost exclusively in composing lieder, shorter and longer songs, even fragments of epics, taking his material from a collection of mediterranean verse in a rather felicitous german translation, which included proven�al and catalonian lyrics from the twelfth and thirteen centuries, italian poetry, visionary highlights from the divina commedia, as well as some spanish and portuguese works
the most contemptuous word from his mouth was progress; he had a scathing way of saying it, and one indeed sensed that he understood the conservative scorn he devoted to progress to be his true passport into this society, the badge of his presentability
the ground was rather slippery and he would have to move with a good deal of grace—which made it that much more suited to him
and when i say, not indifferent, that's not the right way of putting it exactly
she no longer slept—at first because of pain, coughing fits, and shortness of breath, but later because she resisted sleep and fought to stay awake
he had bought it; indeed, he had apparently set his heart on it, because he had immediately outbid an offer that siegismund gosch had received from a party in bremen
at seven o’clock he died—alfreda schildknecht was out in the hall, only his mother and cousin were present
herr settembrini pressed his lips together, and so hans castorp hurried to add that he himself, of course, would refrain from taking sides or endorsing any viewpoint, but he had found it worth listening to what naphta said about the desires of youth
and automatically one set to work to join him in this attitude
the older children attended the local grammar school; although the intellectual offerings of this institution were sufficient for leo’s brothers and sisters, that was anything but the case for him, the oldest
and the moment something begins to subside, to relax, to grow weary, then everything around us is turned loose, resists us, rebels, moves beyond our influence
admittedly, however, kotzebue had been in the employ of the russians, that is, of the holy alliance; and so sand was presumably striking a blow for freedom—but that, too, turned improbable when one considered the fact that he counted jesuits among his closest friends
but once joachim had returned home alone and spread the news among their relatives of how things stood up here, an attack was due, indeed overdue; and so hans castorp had not been the least bit surprised when, barely two weeks after joachim’s departure, the concierge handed him a telegram, whose content he surmised even as he opened it: an announcement of the imminent arrival of james tienappel
laying both hands on the portrait to lift it off its hook, he began hastily by saying, yes indeed, yes indeed
you are part of it the moment you wish to be
european pharmacology had known of it, by the way, for less than three hundred years, and chemistry had discovered quinine less than a hundred years before—that is, the alkaloid that was the basis of its virtue—discovered and to some extent analyzed it, though thus far the chemists could not claim to understand its composition well enough to produce it artificially
you look like you’ve struck root
hans castorp thought, listening intently
behrens was a brick of a fellow and would come up with a cure
he fell silent, sorry that he hadn’t added a final and before letting his voice fall, since he didn’t know what else to say now
i need to speak with you
frau chauchat looked ten years older than she was—as usually happens when amateurs try to capture character
and brotherhood of fidelia, with its great overture in c played before the final scene
recently arrived in ephrata was a young man named herr ludwig, who was skilled in the art of music and held singing classes, and beissel loved to sit in on his musical lessons
both doctors, head nurse von mylendonk, madame chauchat, and the valet were present
but it was unthinkable that she would have reminded young ziemssen, for instance, of his anniversary in february, though the thought probably occurred to her, since her unhappy head was filled with useless dates and facts and she loved keeping track of other people’s affairs
what a fine and gallant conclusion for them to draw!
longhaired goats leapt from ledge to ledge, watched over by a young shepherd, who stood farther up and wore a little hat cocked over his brown curls, the brim rolled up at the back; he leaned against his long staff, grasping it tightly in one hand, setting the other to his hip
but once the word had been recognized, it did not seem appropriate for someone to relieve him of it, to do what we sometimes did and call it out to him in jovial helpfulness
then he examined me and said that everything was going splendidly, but that i should drink mineral water, because i might be just a bit anemic
she founded a sunday school, for example
she turned red and cowered in her seat, feeling as if every eye were watching her
and, propping herself with one hand on a sofa cushion, she rose slightly, since she was not yet sure whether manners required that she stand up
mother is waiting for you on meng strasse
good heavens, i’m a sensible woman, with both feet planted firmly in life, i’ve matured
upon my honor as an old adviser to this family, i know what such a constitution can do
those people knew how to honor death
this earnest, industrious, but chipper man with a rough exterior and no social graces whatever, this man who devoted himself to his work with a dogged sense of duty—this man was alleged to have committed a serious offense, not just once, but repeatedly
they quoted alexis de tocqueville, who had said that two streams flow from the wellspring of revolution-one allowing men to build free institutions, the other leading to absolute power
it only kept me from having to close up shop
with his most devoted compliments and kissing your hand most affectionately, he remains
by noon, streamers were already flying at the table where gänser, rasmussen, and kleefeld sat, and several people—round-eyed marusya for instance—were wearing paper hats, which were also on sale at the limping concierge’s desk in the lobby
gerda looked from one to the other with a rather ironic expression on her face
afraid sometimes of being alone with him, emotionally alone, tu sais
tilting his head forward and to one side, hans castorp followed the whole procedure, but was soon lost in thought as he regarded joachim’s upper body, the way the ribs—thank god he still had all his ribs—rose under the taut skin while the stomach fell with each breath he took
even if, should it be god’s will, his situation were to change and he were no longer in a position to surround you with all these things?
not outside, not at the door?
i don’t know what became of her
he spoke of how easy it would be to divide the lot, emphasized the responsibility he had to his brother and sister, and insisted on a price of thirty thousand thalers courant, whereupon he was forced to listen—with some nervousness, but also with relish—to yet another well-turned rebuttal by herr gosch
the first time he tried this maneuver, she measured him with her eyes, from top to bottom, quite brazenly and without the least embarrassment, while still some distance off; but as she drew nearer she turned her face away indifferently and walked right by him
it was supposed to be a galop, with drum and cymbals to accentuate the strong rhythm, but the other, muddled masses of sound were out of sync, either ahead or behind—a brassy, jangling, insufferable, naïve hullabaloo of growls, blasts, and twitters, and, above it all, the mad fitful tootles of the piccolo
was he satisfied with her answer?
but how delighted i am now to meet you after all
and then i have the vague feeling that one would do better to study metaphysics in germany
and what is this fixation he has about work?
he ran his hand over the smooth, polished surface of the piano, let his eyes glide shyly over the faces of all those present, and, encouraged a little by the gentleness shining in his grandmother’s and aunt tony’s eyes, he began in a low but slightly hard-edged voice:  the shepherd’s sunday song’ … by uhland
i at least did so and endeavored to pay our timorous nackedey the same tacit respect, although adrian, given the complete inattentiveness of his nature, may have always merely tolerated his devotees' ovations and offerings
it was most regrettable that the local public gave him almost no opportunity to prove his theory
and then gradually, from moment to moment, the passionate tone had opened up, swelled, unfolded, grown ever brighter and more radiant
flushed with festivities celebrated between epiphany and ash wednesday at all sorts of public and private affairs, in which i, still a youthful high-school professor from freising, participated either on my own or in adrian's company
let me touch in devotion your pulsing femoral artery where it emerges at the top of your thigh and then divides farther down into the two arteries of the tibia!
it was whispered to her what she had to do, very softly, but quite clearly and distinctly
it’s all so cruel
the olfactory membranes covered an extensive surface; his ears stuck out and were movable, so that they not only played a role in facial expression but also were more adept at catching sound than at present
but when it came time for the funeral—when the whole crowd of relatives, acquaintances, business friends, delegations of grain haulers, office personnel, and warehouse workers filled the rooms, stairwells, and corridors, and every hired carriage in the city stood below on meng strasse—he reappeared, to the genuine delight of the consul, even bringing along his wife and his three grown daughters: friederike and henriette, both very tall and very lanky, and pfiffi, the youngest at eighteen, who was very short and very plump
they heard the first double door open, and in the next moment they heard the latch of the inner one
but then, why did it occur to me?
just among us, it’s even possible that the skin’s task of protecting and defending us may go beyond the merely physical
someone brought a menu from the dining hall, so that several people, both men and women, could try at once, and for each contestant there was an audience keeping a close eye out and someone waiting to grab the pencil being used
but i realized that it left me unstable, erratic, out of control
he had not planned to take this trip particularly seriously, to become deeply involved in it
when she left, nepomuk cried a little, but then promised always to be good until she came to fetch him again
as a child—my god, how tiny she must have been as a child—therese weichbrodt had called herself sesame, and had retained this mutation of her name, allowing the better and more studious of her charges, both boarders and day students alike, to call her that
he was a poly his tor, who could talk about anything and everything, a philosopher of culture, whose opinions, however, were directed against culture insofar as he affected to see all of history as nothing but a process of decline
he loved to smoke it with a good jug of merseburg beer as a nightcap
and then we’d all blow cigarette smoke in his face
occasionally they would all look at one another and suddenly recall what had just happened
i cannot take this any longer, he said, and, supporting himself on pieces of furniture that stood between him and the door, he limped out of the room
arise, go thy way, my good man
yes, i must admit this is the first time i’ve heard about these
the senator shouted, slapping hanno’s cheek with a lightly rolled-up notebook
you maintain that the morality of christian economics, with all its beauty and humanity, creates men who are not free
in those days, the eyes, protected by a third, blinking lid, were at the sides of the head—except for a third eye, of which the pineal gland was a vestige, that was able to patrol the upper air
she had probably only mentioned that previous renter in order to put words to her own guess· and find out more or less with whom she was dealing
no one has ever seen even a speck of dust on him, he never allowed that, his whole life long
herr albin decided to ask what holger’s status and profession had been in life
so, and why not?
from the moment she had realized she was overblown, just picturing what he would do had set her laughing
ah, pah-we will manage in any case!
he could have prevented it, but his influence had not even been put to the test
there is nothing particularly remarkable in her reaction, not when one takes into account how very much the behavior of women—and you may well smile that at my tender age i generalize about women in this way—is dependent on the behavior of a man toward them
and this earned him another rebuke from his father, for speaking in such disparaging tones about the authorities
and there he would sit in its shade-the people at the farm soon found they could leave him to his vacant dozings-on the same circular bench where bawling barnyard hanne had once practiced rounds with us children

he walked to meet the demands of honor, went through the motions required by the force of circumstance
erature and music-after which the destiny of art proved to be an even deeper, more alienating rupture between what is good and easy, admirable and diverting, progressive and generally enjoyable
he mentioned the jerusalem evenings and her sunday school; employing all his rhetorical brilliance, he reviewed the long, rich, and happy life upon earth of her who had now gone to her heavenly reward—even the word end had to have its adjective, and he concluded by speaking of her peaceful end
madame krauseminz takes good care of her and sees that she doesn’t starve
most certainly not, what a foolish undertaking that would be
but he’s not here just for the fun of it, by the way, because in addition to a proper mucus obstruction caused by alcohol, it appears to be a case of a malign tropical fever, intermittent, you see, protracted, chronic
now, now, what’s this i hear, professor naphta?
i could not help accentuating my farewell with the mention of his name-his first name, as was natural for me
do freemasons believe in god?
as they are leaving, however, and still standing in the doorway, frau permaneder turns around once more
what he forgot was the respect he owes me and our family name—he never understood that from the very beginning
although klothilde buddenbrook was not much older than her married cousin—she had just turned twenty-one—there were already pronounced lines in her long face, and her hair, which had never been blond but more a mousy gray, was parted and drawn back tight to complete the picture of an old maid, a state with which she was quite content and which she did nothing to remedy
habit arises when our sense of time falls asleep, or at least, grows dull; and if the years of youth are experienced slowly, while the later years of life hurtle past at an ever-increasing speed, it must be habit that causes it
to the absolute, to the broader application of categories
before going to sleep, whether lying in the grass or curled up in a chair, he would also put out his hand to shake as he said, night!
she was one of behrens’s private outpatients, and the director had commended her to the cousins’ charity
crude sets of stairs formed from protruding roots and jutting rocks led from one tier to the next, and at each level white wooden tables, benches, and chairs were set out among the trees
at their very first meeting, in fact, the supervising physician had found him very anemic, and in consequence of all this, it now appeared that the length of stay that he—hans castorp—had originally planned could no longer be regarded as sufficient
it must have been during our early years at school, though the exact moment cannot be determined, when he ceased to grant me that intimacy and, if he addressed me at all, began to use my last name-whereas it would have seemed to me impossibly harsh to reply in like fashion
a loose woolen jacket, a kind of peacoat that buttoned high and thus required no cravat, worn with any ·old pair
my, but you are being hard on me, herr behrens
lactantius, whom constantine the great chose to be his son’s tutor, put the question quite directly: how would it help him gain his salvation if he knew the sources of the nile or the ravings of physicists about the heavens?
but is it only his?
it’s sad—the way the firm fell off in the last twenty years
and grabbing hans castorp by the arm, he pulled him over to the rows of dark glass plates; he flipped a switch
but the most bone-chilling sound is the appli-
these creatures have fixed their rigidity on the outside, not as a framework, but as a house, and the fact that it is external and not internal must be the reason for such beauty
i’m sitting in the pensée room, which serves as our sitting room
the dancing would get much more lively as the evening progressed; countless patients from the various sanatoriums and patients living brazenly on their own at the kurhaus or other hotels would join in later in much greater number than now, and many a serious case had danced his way to eternity here, first tossing back the beaker of life and then hemorrhaging one last time in dulci jubilo
and so forth, little johann said
and it was all so different, so totally and blissfully different from that glance at his boots—it was a stroke of good fortune, a turn for the better, indeed for the best, an unparalleled event almost beyond comprehension
you see, i am overcoming my legitimate reserve and am already practicing this rash form of address
he howled and began to drum both fists on the table, setting all the dishes rattling and dancing
they had all joined in the laughter, mainly out of respect for the head of the family
would the gentleman like to speak with the young lady?
the sun and the waning moon both stood rather high in the pure blue
but an argument carried on as if it were a matter of life and death, and with such wit and polish as if it were not, but merely an elegant competition—and that was how all disputes were carried on between settembrini and naphta—such an argument is, in and of itself, quite naturally entertaining to listen to, even for someone who understands little of it and only vaguely comprehends its significance
but now, one morning at first breakfast, quite surprisingly, out of the blue so to speak, he had a fit, a seizure, arousing general commotion and bringing the entire dining hall to its feet
yes indeed, his own body might be venomous, but he had kept his mind healthy and uninfected enough to defy naphta’s priestly views concerning the body and to ridicule what he called the soul
doubtless they constituted a significant plus for his final exams, of which, to be sure, he spoke disdainfully, though he was in the midst of preparing for them
and what do you know: sitting there next to his stepbrother in the back seat of the high, wide, overstuffed carriage, he crossed one short leg over the other, and proved quite conciliatory and cordial
and capitalist europe wills its own, as well
a new house, a radical change in his outward life—that would mean packing, moving, refitting his life, casting aside everything old and superfluous, the detritus of years past
but no more than half an hour
then as a discharged soldier restored to his teaching post in freising
the mark of such a neurotic descent into the depths of antiquity, of the secret psychological state of such a town, is found in the many
and again, his last drink with his friends, the st john's farewell, has all the marks of ritual, is presented as another last supper
i had indeed begun to suspect that you had departed when i saw your place vacant down in the refectory
you go to classes when you feel like it, quite voluntarily, you sit down and listen just like in the theater
but taking of nourishment’ is basic physiology, and to tell someone to savor’ it is pure sarcasm
to repeat, i felt happy to know that i was in the same situation as he, and not left to sit behind the men now guarding our nation
he thrust his head forward like a bull
so heavy was the weight that in comparison they seemed diminished, impaired—which not only the sly observer noticed, but also, without doubt, those involved, both the two frail hyperarticulate gentlemen and the grand stammerer himself
it appears first in what is probably the most beautiful of the thirteen brentano lieder, all composed while he was still in leipzig, in the heart-wrenching song: oh sweet maiden, how bad you are, which is totally governed by the motif; and then in the late work, with its unique blend of boldness and despair, most especially in lamentation of dr faustus, which was written in pfeiffering and displays to an even greater extent a tendency to present those melodic intervals in harmonic simultaneity
as he lies in remote, feverish dreams, lost in their heat, the patient is called back to life by an unmistakable, cheering voice
since my parents were in the leverkiihn's circle of
those are the trombones!
he left half his cocoa and refused the egg; his mouth still wrenched with pain, he made some sort of sound that might have been a goodbye and ran out of the house
but what did i hear a few minutes ago?
there you are surrounded by both business and professional men, where everyone can hear you, and you say, seen in the light of day, actually, every businessman is a swindler’—you, who are a businessman yourself, a part of a firm that strives with might and main for absolute integrity, for a spotless reputation
she met mamselle jungmann on the stairs to the third floor and whispered something to her in a strained voice
what hindered him from doing so was an inherited and ingrained sense of family, which meant that he looked not only to the past with a reverent interest in its intimate history, but also to the future; his thoughts were influenced as well by the loving, expectant curiosity with which his friends and acquaintances in town, his sister, and even the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse regarded his son
introduced into the bloodstream, they brought forth results we considered quite astounding, simply because we were not used to equating protein and poison
but as the child was of flesh and blood and it being conditional that i might love no human creature, so did he slay it without mercy and to that end did use my own eyes
not because he wanted to defy his father, or hurt him
the wind, by the way, was at his back, and somewhat to one side, so there was little reason to turn around and take it head-on; and this consideration, added to his obstinacy and his basic oh, so what!
around ten o’clock the sun would appear like a wisp of softly illumined vapor above its mountain, a pale spook spreading a faint shimmer of reality over the vague, indiscernible landscape
frau stöhr’s affectations were dreadful to behold
hans castorp appeared to have joined the quietists, who claimed that to act was an affront to god, who alone can will to act; his activities during this week, at any rate, were limited to a visit with behrens
with many apologies, they carefully put it back in its proper place
she runs—as a lady is not supposed to run
just above the secretary hung a painting in muted colors, a depiction of an old-fashioned marketplace and a church, and in its steeple, a real clock had just struck ten in its distinctive tones
but you must explain one thing for me, he went on
he was still flushed and had just lit a cigar to reward himself
why, if i may ask?
there was proof enough that it did so in his restatement of ideas adopted from kretzschmar about how the sensual was not to be disdained in art, and not just in it-plus many of his remarks about wagner and such spontaneous comments as the one about the nakedness of the human voice and how older vocal music had compensated for it intellectually with the most confounded artistic devices
but you see now, don’t you?
what sort of stature do i have—judge for yourself
not long after he left, joachim would appear, already dressed by then, to say good morning and ask his cousin about his seven o’clock temperature and inform him of his own
during this period, ice-packs and cold dousings of the head were prescribed morning therapies, and they proved more useful than those that had preceded them, although only as palliatives whose mild effect did not justify any talk of recovery
the same applied to joachim
and the wind, the west wind, which had been playing in the trees in st mary’s cemetery and driving the dust in little whirlwinds along the dark streets, no longer stirred
it also irritated me that bullinger, the manufacturer, was among those invitedauthorized solely on the basis of his high income-tax bracket loudly to blow off steam about the weightiest cultural issues
the fact is, i had wanted him to notice, and remember, even then—otherwise i would not have said it
in reality he was already badly battered, and was struggling against his incipient sensory muddle—but in a muddled and feverish way
dour spruces, symmetrical and gigantic, stood solitary and in small groups along the bottom of the gorge and farther up the slopes
she claimed by far the largest share of the furnishings for herself, her daughter, and her granddaughter
i do not suppose, he said, you were expecting me to burst into moral indignation and fits of rage
something to help me sleep
well, castorp, i don’t want to be like that, and so i’ll return you to human society
through a glass door, opposite the windows, a columned hallway was visible in the semidarkness, and to the left of someone entering the room were wide folding doors that opened onto the dining room
the ring is not quality gold, and it is rather small, i notice
it was generally known that he was tipsy as hell, a man in a highly lambent state, who did not care who noticed
yes, well, as far as it’s in my powers and to the extent i have any influence
she laughed a great deal and likewise spoke russian, only russian
would you please be so kind?
he concluded, and throwing his head back, he downed his burgundy and champagne in two great gulps
and then he went on to speak of clerical demagoguery, of the absolute lust for power that condescended to rouse the denizens of the underworld when the gods quite understandably did not wish to hear from them, and suggested that the church was apparently more concerned with the quantity than the quality of souls saved, which indicated a profound lack of spiritual nobility
this so-called benefactor of mankind talked a fine game about purification and sanctification, but in fact he was bent upon the emasculation of life, wanted to let it bleed to death
she was an old woman, a woman from a different time, with a different way of looking at things
you could almost say: if that’s all it wants, then in god’s name, let it have it
and yet no one felt all that easy about the word, even if it was a standard word for their cheerful comrade, dr krokowski
in a word: hans castorp had found courage up here—if courage before the elements is defined not as a dull, level-headed relationship with them, but a conscious abandonment to them, the mastering of the fear of death out of sympathy with them
it’s very becoming for clavdia
and how’s it going?
and, indeed, there in the shadows little christian lay huddled on the padded bench that encircled the middle column
there was a bleeding entrance wound below one eye
we’ve been up here together for so long now—seven months, if you stop to count—which isn’t all that much by our standards up here, but when viewed from down below, now that i think back on it, it’s quite a long time
as for hans castorp’s case, the optical and acoustical results corresponded as precisely as one could ever demand of science
we assert, we recount, that he had
and then the way he would slip in those quotes from heine and other poets, even when talking about the most practical matters, about business or civic issues
hans castorp had not slept much that night
as for yourself—you’ve always been rather anemic, am i right?
joachim asked in a low voice after a while, although he had not actually seen hans castorp consult his thermometer
you call them grand’ and i call them intimate’—what they’re called doesn’t make any difference
at last everything was in order
the physical harassment whose victim he had been for so long-the gastric catarrhs, the throat infections, the agonizing migraine attacks-had vanished
and those are the commitments between which we have to choose at present
and then followed the question as to how permaneder intended to act in light of these facts
the books lay piled high on the table with the lamp, but one was on the floor mat next to his lounge chair and another, the one hans castorp had last been reading, lay across his stomach, its weight making it very difficult for him to breathe, although his cerebral cortex had sent no order to the appropriate muscles to remove it
everything could truly have turned out differently, had he not been such a lame sonny boy and clarissa had found in him a more dependable support
the lawyers, however, were gentlemen who, in his opinion, understood nothing about such matters, they lived in a different world; and, proceeding from a totally different perspective, they judged him guilty of fraud—a verdict backed up by the power of the state
he had tried to bring up the subject of this latest death with his tablemates, but had been met by a unanimous rebuff so sullen that he felt both chagrined and outraged
or rather, in light of our duty, our holy obligation—for example, the debt of honor incumbent upon me to turn with a most cordial heart to you, so small but full of character—a gin, my love!
we did not have to wrest the revolver from her; she had dropped it, or rather thrown it away, in the direction of her victim
now hans castorp lifted his head, and without having to search, his eyes looked in the right direction
well, we all will belong to it sooner or later
she cried several times and demanded that they play beethoven’s erotica at his graveside
not only a disgrace, but probably also an act of stupidity
for the ascetic spirit—if he might be permitted a tautology—the spirit that denied and destroyed the world, was nobility itself, the aristocratic principle in its purest form; it could never be popular, and indeed the church had been essentially unpopular throughout the ages
fine, i am ready to accept responsibility
tony walked slowly and rather gingerly toward the glass door
but the infection hans castorp knew was going round had even influenced the freemason’s clear intellect, robbing him of his laughter, leaving him seriously vulnerable to the inflammatory charms of slaps exchanged in the name of honor; in addition, though he had his good days, which were more like teasing setbacks, the old affirmer of life had turned gloomy watching the inexorable deterioration in his health; feeling intensely ashamed, he cursed it and despised himself when it forced him to take to his bed every few days now
but it’s getting late, the senator said, flipping open the cover on his pocket watch
just a girl of course, armgard von schilling, who lives over there, the one i told you about
religion and ethics were related only insofar as the latter was the former in decay
do you mean your husband, perhaps, my child?
he rinsed his eyes and washed his hands, combed his hair and set his clothes to rights
one day she had a very nasty attack of stomach cramps—right after friederike, henriette, and pfiffi buddenbrook had proclaimed in unison that the hagenströms were the cream of society
messengers scurry in all directions and pay a visit as well to the fisherman, who recollects
it was only out of great desperation that he had managed to utter the word damned
there was still light in her room
they were ill, both of them—all the same, it certainly showed what peculiar social customs young people had up here
the mood was very lively at the good russian table, where the first pop of a cork was heard from the champagne being served at almost all the tables
the young lady's father had been a high-ranking judge, up in bayreuth, and had bought himself an electric automobile-that had been the start of all his troubles
and, gasping for air, exhausted, stiff, and sweaty, he dragged himself across the red-brick schoolyard and pushed his way inside through one of the swinging doors with its pretty panel of stained glass
that, that, that, is his love for her!
we europeans can’t wait
if i’m not sadly mistaken, you can’t be all that blasé, either, given what went on before, you purple-cheeked widower with your lifelike oils
but adrian's relationship to art was too proud and critical for him to have wished to let his light shine in the darkness
do you catch cold often?
and now just imagine, my good engineer, and you my fine lieutenant, what i, the son of such a father, must suffer in this damnable and barbaric place, where my body shivers with cold at the height of summer, even as my soul is constantly tortured by debasing sights
that would be, we repeat, not only possible, but when viewed in the spirit of a tolerant relativism a la when in rome, it might also be considered legitimate, healthy, and respectable
he accused him of a 'lack of intelligence' -avec que/que raison, for bruckner was indeed a simple, childlike soul lost in his own majestic, figured-bass music and a complete idiot in all other matters of european culture
very kind of you, he said, adopting formal pronouns himself, and it was the correct thing to do
and then, too, this grandfather’s seditious conspiracy, or so they were told, had been bound up with the love of his fatherland, which he hoped to see free and united—indeed, his subversive activities were the fruit and outcome of that honorable affection; and however strange this mixture of rebellion and patriotism might seem to both cousins (accustomed as they were to equating patriotic feelings with preservation of the established order), they did have to admit in private that as things had stood back then, rebellion might very well have been commensurate with civic virtue and sober loyalty with idle unconcern about matters of public order
obtuse frau stöhr went on and on in this way with ghastly thoroughness until the brief, if ample meal was over
and with that he stood up, squared his chair back into its place, and turned toward the door
the pulse was rapid
the unrest and conflicts in both  and the present year of  had cost the firm as well
my heart falters when i think
our friends had been ceded a truly extensive realm on the ground floor, including a living room the size of a salon, which had two windows and a stone floor (but so did all the other rooms in the house), was cool, shady, a little dark, and simply furnished with wicker chairs and horsehair sofas, but was indeed so large that two people could live there, separated from one another by considerable space, each pursuing his business undisturbed
even when he wasn’t busy, herr brecht thought it incumbent upon him to let his patients wait a little
and, then, i’m not all that rash about forming opinions
at the next two parties he still had to attend, he would presumably do much the same thing again
but he had no time to worry about that now
he quickly got to his feet, grabbed his large gray hat from the table, kissed her hand, and hurried out through the glass door
and would you believe that i’ve laid them out thirty-two times in a row now, without being able to get halfway through even once?
what title did she wish, did she claim?
then he told about how when playing the piano as a lad, long before he knew anything about brahms, he had come up with a motif that was almost identical with the highly romantic horn theme in the final movement, without, to be sure, the rhythmic trick of the dotted eighth following the sixteenth, but melodically in exactly the
a chivalrous and high-spirited man, peeperkorn repeated without picking up on the remark about naphta, although—permit me a qualification—although not without his prejudices

not only in the environs of pfeiffering (or pfeffering, the spelling could indeed vary) was there a communal bench set atop a hill-not, however, called mount zion, but the rohmbiihel; not only was there a pond like the cattle trough-here named klammer pool-about the same distance from the farm and likewise with very cold water

for their part, these wives of jewish publishers and bankers looked up to him with that profound admiration their race has for german master blood and long legs, and took great pleasure in giving him presents-the sporty socks, belts, sweaters, and scarves he wore were presents for the most part, and had come not always totally unprompted

in her chaste country garb-a habit of olive-green wool that was a testimony to clerical stricture, with a bodice that was studded with two closely set rows of metal buttons, closed high at the neck, flattened her youthful bosom, and fell to a tapered point over the wide full-length gathered skirt, its only ornament a chain of old silver coins worn under the ruche at her throat-the brown-eyed maiden sat beside the invalid and like a schoolgirl intoning a litany, read to him from texts to which the parish priest would certainly have had no objection: early christian and medieval visionary literature and speculations about the world beyond

monsignor hinterpfortner and i certainly can no longer be alone in this dreadful and at the same time-god help us!-secretly uplifting realization
she requested that he not continue his attempt, that it was not a matter of her understanding the role he had accepted
i had to smile at the odd depth of feeling with which the composer accedes to the yearning for the sweet life of the south awakened by the immortal bird in the soul of the poet of the nightingale-since in italy adrian had never shown much enthusiastic gratitude for the consolations of a sunny world that lets man forget  the weariness, the fever, and the fret-here where men sit and hear each other groan

how often had he looked at it and pressed it to his lips during the time that had passed since then, bringing forth its changes—changes, for instance, like getting used to life up here without clavdia chauchat present in a shared space

i am considerate of what is popular, but samiel is foolish, and
it had been a good six weeks away when hans castorp had first been surprised to hear talk about the holidays—as long, if you stopped to count, as his originally scheduled stay plus the period he had spent in bed, which, as hans castorp looked back on it now, had seemed a very long time back then, particularly those first three weeks, whereas the same number of days now appeared to add up to very little, almost nothing
johann could never understand how, at the end of the school term, any teacher could bring himself to say something like: and we shall pick up here after summer vacation and then move on to this or that… after summer vacation!

at the next table on their left was an adolescent boy—still of school age, to judge by his appearance—whose coat sleeves were too short, and who wore thick, circular glasses; he chopped up everything heaped on his plate until it was a pasty hodgepodge, then bent over it and wolfed it down, now and then pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears

dr langhals asked, searching little johann’s face with his conceited eyes
at the sight of the beautiful boy-while his indulgent big sister looked on, obviously expecting nothing else, having grown accustomed to everyone's falling in love with the youngest of her family

researchers had been able to isolate and concentrate the toxins from several such microorganisms and were amazed to find that, if injected into an animal’s bloodstream, even tiny doses of such materials, which could be classified as simple proteins, produced the most acute toxic effects, leading to rapid demise
but hans castorp could not get the cough he had heard out of his mind and kept repeating that it was literally like looking down inside the horseman; and as they entered the restaurant, his eyes, weary from the trip, had taken on a glint of nervous excitement
when herr grünlich entered the pensée room, tony was standing there with the bronze watering can in her hand
ah, he could still feel a little sand from the beach in his high-buttoned shoes—he would ask grobleben to leave it in there, forever
do you understand ?
at some point he would have had to admit that, given his pedagogic streak, his own masculinity was not of a strictly social, cock-of-the-walk nature, either, which explained why the grand peeperkorn was as much a disruption to his meditations as were naphta and frau chauchat; and finally, he could not hope to disabuse his pupil of the effects of a personality and superior nature, effects from which neither he nor his partner in cerebral matters was able to exclude himself
my dazed state transfer unto your person the chill of fever against which i have wrapped myself, and behold you merely but to see its source m you
just watch, he’ll pop up one day right beside me, smiling his gracious smile
in fact, he felt as if he had only just now reestablished a connection with yesterday, as if he were taking in the whole picture again, as it were, which had not really been the case since he awoke
he waved above their heads
in short, my situation is, i think, correct; it corresponds to the general state of affairs and in particular to my own sincere regard for your person, mynheer peeperkorn
he was simply not a hero, which is to say, he did not let his relationship with the man be determined by the woman
those were happy, easygoing times back then, when my grandfather’s crony good old jean jacques hoffstede strolled about and translated little off-color poems from the french
you were only waiting for mother to die, so that you could …
strange, how it looks like a bad conscience-homophonic music's bad conscience in the presence of polyphony
this morning she was wearing her dark-red dressing gown, its color exactly matched to the tones of the wallpaper above the wainscoting, its texture softer than the softest cotton, and its large-flowered print embroidered everywhere with sprays of tiny glass pearls in the same hue
the fact is, the account of the first three weeks of hans castorp’s stay with the people up here (twenty-one days at the height of summer, to which, by all calculation, it was supposed to have been limited) has consumed quantities of space and time that correspond only too well to what the author himself expected, and indeed half confessed; the coverage of the next three weeks of the visit, however, will require about as many lines—or words, or even seconds—as the first three weeks required pages, quires, hours, and working days
with a few suggestive phrases, he could turn a prosaic everyday scene into stark reality, so that they all shivered when he now spoke of the ice-cold water in the sponge that you pressed to the back of your neck on such a morning—and called it holy
what he felt was the satisfaction of a sufferer who has always known only shame and the bite of conscience for hiding the suffering that cold, hard life brings, and who now, suddenly, from the hand of a great and wise man, receives elemental, formal justification for having felt such suffering in this world—in this best of all possible worlds, which by means of playful scorn was proved to be the worst of all possible worlds
it’s not a pain, really, it’s an ache, a vague ache, because all these nerves here are too short
the consul emerged from his office, his quill behind one ear, just as brother and sister entered the passage, and he stretched his arms out to his daughter
and i realized that he understands me so well, respects me so much more than the others that he can call me a name, a name that one of your warehouse workers wouldn’t even call a dog
what was a day, measured for instance from the moment you sat down to your midday meal to the return of that same moment twenty-four hours later?
i would have wished to see you go in some other way, but it doesn’t matter
oh, but wait, that isn’t what i wanted to say, that isn’t what i want to reproach you for
the boy named teddy, to take just one example, was no longer a boy one day—though of course that did not happen one day, but emerged out of some quite indefinite day
i think the world and life are such that people ought to dress mostly in black, with a starched ruff instead of your military collar, and deal with one another in a serious, muted, formal way, always keeping death in mind—that’s how i’d like it, that would be moral
and indeed, there was in what he played for us more than enough reason besides for praise and joyful amazement!
each pops softly, and in between she says, you good chawld
since you wish it, that’s how it will be
although one’s general metabolism increases, the body stores the protein
you did a nice job with that, iwersen
which means that you’ll have to pry and pull four times?
do you know what that means, my good engineer: to be lost to life’?
when they merely wanted to say:
it would have been different had it been work, some worry or trouble, that interposed itself—his mind could not have overlooked or bridged that sort of thing quite so easily
settembrini said, the gentlemen are in high spirits—and with good cause, good cause
but i am falling into my old bad habits and getting ahead of myself
and what efforts we have made since then—all the sweet triumphs, the fine coups now and then
understanding had not exactly prevailed, neither the country nor the artistic sort, but just the wild fear of townsfolk for their social standing, and the young lady had literally writhed there on the floor in front of her parents, pleading and sobbing, while they cursed and shook their fists, until finally she had fainted dead away along with her mother
who convince themselves and others that what is tedious has grown interesting, because what is interesting has begun to grow tedious
but catarrhs are not colds, they come from an infection to which one is already susceptible, and the only question is whether what we have here is an innocent infection or one that is less innocent, all the rest is twiddle-twaddle
but no sooner had consul hagenström stepped out into the street than he turned to his companion, the broker, and engaged him in what was obviously a very lively discussion
yes, that was peculiar—but at the same time hans castorp was astonished that he found it peculiar, and the uneasy feeling that had sent him searching for advice and support rose up inside him again
when herr grünlich departed that evening, he had only strengthened the impression left behind on his first visit
you must play it again soon
the consul would immediately cut him off with an icy remark
he had placed an opened old testament against the back of the boy in front of him, and he read from it now with a look of total innocence and thoughtful concentration, then stared at a spot on the wall and provided a wretched modern german translation of what he had read, pausing frequently to give a squeaky cough
and we’ve always spent his salary
times of tempest and trouble
as the house stands
he wore a cinnamon jacket with broad lapels and leg-of-mutton sleeves that closed tight just below the wrist
herr settembrini, who realized that all possibility of human exchange, of a democratic chat or perhaps even argument, had now been cut off, flung one hand above his head in his gesture of despair and resignation
you’ve got a good thing there, something really solid
dates were known and recorded for this ancestor: duly entered were the dates when he had a case of boils and when he had genuine pox; there were tidy entries for when he had fallen from the fourth story onto the drying-room floor, and lived to tell of it, although he struck a great many beams on the way down, and for when he had been delirious with a high fever
an american woman died here the day before yesterday, joachim said
the quartan fever had been fierce that morning, in all three of its’ stages—the chill, the hot flush, and the sweats—and peeperkorn’s little pale eyes gazed out dully from under the idol-like tracery of his brow
yours is acute, but harmless
so much for now about the daughters, adrian's housemates, with whom he soon established friendly relations
for her part, tony raised her shoulders just a little, laid her head back, trying all the while to tuck her chin against her chest, and greeted them as if from unattainable heights, her glance brushing past julie möllendorpf’s broad-brimmed, elegant hat
he experiences headaches, and his mind feels numb, edgy, and dazed, with occasional spells of dizziness
my uncle is very apoplectic, you see—stout, hardly any neck
which only made his father’s voice sound that much louder when he interrupted
don’t hang on to the piano—fold your hands in front of you and stand up tall
joachim, whose temperature had likewise shown a welcome decline, had seconded this invigorating change of schedule and had not disagreed with hans castorp’s suggestion
at most, her smile and voice suggested the kind of excitement that comes when the first words in a long, silent relationship are spoken at last—a subtle excitement secretly incorporating into this one moment everything that has happened until now
what do these people want?
they have been called up, these comrades here, for a final push in a battle that has lasted all day, to regain that hill position and the burning villages just beyond, which were lost to the enemy two days before
and you are making a fool of yourself with your little love affairs, with your buffoonery, with your sicknesses, with your remedies for your sicknesses
his exams had meant a long period of concentrated work, and upon returning home he looked paler than he ought—even given his general type
revolution and preservation—they looked to peeperkorn as he trudged along with his hat pulled down low, hardly cutting a particularly grand figure as he tilted to one side with each step; they watched him jerk his head in jest toward the combatants, and heard those wide, irregular, ragged lips say: yes—yes—yes!
but for a moment hans castorp could see across the room to a waxen profile against pillows, a young man with a sparse goatee, who slowly rolled his very large eyes toward the door
just as things had once gone between elia naphta and his rabbi, so they went now—teacher and student did not get along, religious and philosophical friction increased, grew worse and worse
joachim had sat down on a kind of cobbler’s bench, facing a panel, against which he now pressed his chest, hugging it at the same time with both arms
you gentlemen will have to excuse me
oh, papa, she said softly, her lips barely moving, looking back now, wouldn’t it have been better if …
that happened here, in his parents’ home, across the way in the drawing room, in front of the middle window, and it was old pastor hesekiel who baptized him, the same one who almost got himself shot by the french when he was a young man, for preaching against their looting and burning—he’s been resting in the lord for a long, long time now
a blind man would have noticed how things stood with him; he had done nothing to keep it secret
he drank like a fish
that's the thing-you are not thinking of time in its courses, you are not thinking historically when you complain that some one or another could have it entire, joys and pains unending, without that his hour-glass had been turned or that at the end his bill be presented him
a partial payment, kesselmeyer
or they would make general remarks about how undignified and vain it was to dye one’s hair, or inquire all too sympathetically about how jakob kröger, elisabeth’s nephew, was doing
one can at least put it that way
now is not then, here is not there—for in both cases motion lies in between
for as the clock struck, once, then twice, the charming patient had slowly turned her head, and a little of her upper body, too, to gaze plainly and openly over her shoulder at hans castorp’s table—and not just at the table in general, no, quite unmistakably and very personally at him, a smile playing on her closed lips and in her narrow pribislav eyes, as if to say: well?
then he had set out for the funeral in riga, had returned with his brother-in-law, tiburtius, who had spent several days with the family of his dear, departed wife and had even visited christian in the hospital in hamburg
i find it most instructive to follow your train of thought
and had she told her parents about it?
the little hand tripped along paying no heed to the numerals as it came up on them, touched and passed them, left them behind, far behind, and returned to come up on them again
he had been sitting there drumming his fingers on the table and twirling his moustache
heliotropic as science says of life-forms
why had they approached him with this proposal just now, prematurely rousing him from sensible resignation, filling him with doubt and indecision?
premièrement l’un et maintenant l’autre
that is not what i wanted to say
david was already no less stultified and alienated from his origins-if not to say, grown no less brutish-than solomon
hans castorp mulled this over as rapidly as possible
they attended an ice-skating contest, a bobsled race—for the winter sport season in our alpine valley was in full swing
kesselmeyer, you’ve eaten at my table…
instead, the more they talked the more confused i got
for although silly enough, they placed what we had heard under a soothing and accepted aspect, the aesthetic, which, however inappropriate,
they simply belonged to the fixed schedule of a normal day, and ended the main rest cure with an apostrophe
he spoke the c of coffee far back in his throat, as if already tasting and swallowing it
how goes it, lad!
the doctor came to look at him
he took the violinist's instrument from him, and having first turned it around in his hands to establish its origin, he improvised quite grandly on it, even inserting, just to make us laugh, a few bars of the cadenza from his violin concerto
i remained in munich for two days to say goodbye here and there and to supplement my gear with some minor items
but we ought to have made a million long before this, he said, his voice edgy with excitement, his hands trembling
and since, as he had noted, hans castorp was looking robust and really quite splendid thanks to his stay at the sanatorium, which had gone on much longer than expected, he assumed that his nephew would be returning home with him now
why, you’re asleep, joachim said
oh no, it won’t turn out all right
if only there had not been something in that sublime exercise of intellect that kept one in a state of constant anxiety
hanno’s gratitude to his teacher was boundless, and he abandoned himself to his guidance
interrogation under torture, what did the gentlemen think of that?
he was in charge of the sanatorium, its highest authority—and hans castorp’s heart felt a restive longing for paternal authority
have you firmly resolved the matter?
and as winter set in and then lost its fury again, thomas buddenbrook’s new house rose above the roomy cellars
i’ve just returned from a situation that is much sadder, let me tell you
the consul felt an irresistible need to go back upstairs and see about the ladies
development had been a small part of the �onata, a modest refuge for subjective illumination and energy
a great many noble and prudent minds have detested tobacco smoke
all i have to do is make a few payments and advances here and there, and patience and respect will be restored
you have already experienced the advantages of such a relationship
and so bourgeois imperialism, accustomed now to victory, could not warn enough against anarchy,
i’ve used it with you all along, and will for all eternity
opiates are the devil’s tool, for they create dullness, rigidity, stagnation, slavish inertia
a k ferge, the simple martyr to whom all higher things were foreign, had held such a ghostly hand in his own hand one evening and had determined by touch that it was well formed and whole, whereupon, by some means he could not quite describe, it had withdrawn itself from his grip, which though hearty had been quite within the bounds of respect
i assure you that the whole mood was shot to hell
i don’t always remember everything that may burst from my lips
publicly, i shall stand quite aloof from the whole affair
i have taken a couple of rooms at the city of hamburg inn … and here i am, antonie, to hear from your own lips that last, decisive word that will make me happier than i can possibly express
the league in which you claim we stand, has itself to do with love, you ninny
i’ve already made it clear to him how he behaved, thomas, she interrupted, sitting up and laying a hand across her breast, more than clear, let me tell you
yes, you shall have your look at the state of my affairs, nothing can escape your eyes
a narrative, then, can set to work and deal with time in much the same way as those depraved dreams
but i ask you, it’s almost eight years now since i’ve seen him—and under the circumstances
the one a piano teacher, the other an active partner in a visceral enterprise, that is to say, in a firm that produced sausage casings
the horses of the funeral coach were shrouded in black, with only their restless eyes visible
the lamps were extinguished, the curtains flew apart, anemic daylight filled the room, and cold foggy air poured in through the wide windows
material, it is the person himself-and so hardly suitable for artistic segmentation
at present he was busy supplementing an english-german dictionary that he considered inadequate
no sooner would she take time to catch her breath than new words were gushing and surging out of her
and are you going to accept?
that’s what people call a passion, i believe
i love my violin and have come rather far with it, but i value the piano more
it was just like a day many years before, when hans castorp had been privileged to hear a world-famous singer, an italian tenor, from whose throat the power of grace-filled art had poured out over the hearts of men
but that could be demonstrated only if a chill was also present—otherwise the skin remained hot
it turned out that they had mistaken a precipitate of gypsum for protoplasm
what about you, christian?
herr gosch was not doing well; with a lovely, sweeping gesture he rebuffed any assumption that he should be counted among life’s fortunate
but the consul returned alone again and walked over to herr grünlich, who was standing at the window staring out into the rain, his hands behind his back
for a slightly tipsy young master of the muffling art with an abnormal skin condition, who was no longer totally lacking in experience when it came to illicit matters, this was a speculation that bore the stamp of logic and truth and, far from being absurd, seemed as perfectly obvious as it was illuminating
partial payment, my foot!
but that only seems to be the case
they quoted herr stengel: you were asked to draw a line, and what have you done?
what have i ever done to him?
yes, it’s almost too beautiful, tony
she was quite aware of her obligations to her family and the firm, was proud of those obligations
well, i later rendered that service to my friend and like to think back to that evening and our first exploratory conversation on the subject
honored friends!—this humble rhyming
settembrini, the italian corrected him with particular verve, accompanied by a facetious bow
hans castorp was angry at the italian, and at himself, too, because it was his own lack of self-control that had provoked the gibe
what folly, what a misconception!
it’s an honor to meet you, herr grünlich
but recently—it must have been, wait a moment—probably eight weeks ago—
he, too, was often confined to bed; the cracked-porcelain sound in his voice rattled more loudly now when he spoke, and as his fever rose, he spoke more—and more caustically and cuttingly than ever
but then, although tony was not present at his farewell visit, herr grünlich left for hamburg
but there’s so little love in you that you never once visited me—not once—when i was lying there in the hospital in hamburg, struck down by rheumatic fever
and i realized that nothing was keeping me there, and that it would be a disgrace to stay
and so when tous-les-deux—the pallid, black-clad mother from mexico—happened to meet the cousins in the corridor, she expressed her gratitude, chiefly by a series of mournfully becoming gestures, and in her clanking french asked for them to receive in person the thanks of her son—de son seul et dernier fils qui allait mourir aussi
what did he have to say about it today?
only one i would not and will not hear, for it is a most certain spiteful slander and befits me not in the least
that clear, fresh voice reaches his spirit wandering along strange, hot paths and leads it back to cooling shade and peace
life could cancel itself by such means, then there could be no possibility of informed life
in a gurgling voice with a serious impediment, he would address hans castorp—as he did all the patients—by his room number and then proceed to rub him down with alcohol
and, to cap it all, at almost the same time that b grünlich went bankrupt, something even worse happened at dahlbeck & co, where jakob worked in hamburg
the old woman asked after a pause
he always was concerned about his body, much more than i, or at least in a different way than i, because i was always the civilian, and more interested in a nice warm bath and good food and drink, when what he wanted were challenges and exploits
and for whom should he have gone to any trouble?
are you going to go, hans?
you may well imagine that many topics of conversation offered themselves as we dined; but no sooner was the soup course ended than we left old anecdotes behind and proceeded to more serious and fascinating subjects
the senate had already proposed the latter
it has a castle and a cathedral, where one is shown the tomb of kaiser otto i i i , adelheid's grandson and theophano's son, who called himself both emperor of the romans and saxonicus, not because he wanted to be a saxon, but in the same sense that scipio took the name africanus-that is, because he had defeated the saxons
it was the theme, the first theme again!
but the tone, which is no more, for which, as it hangs there vibrating in the silence, only the soul still listens, and which was the dying note of sorrow-is no longer that, its meaning changes, it stands as a light in the night
and what are you reading, fräulein buddenbrook, if i might ask?
this was a significant decision, which, as i saw it, was uniquely stamped with destiny and which in some sense both annulled the recent past and reconnected with our common life from long ago, with moments whose memory i bore in my heart: with the time when i had found the lad experimenting on his uncle's harmonium, and, still farther back, with our singing canons with barnyard hanne under the linden tree
and from under his fingers came a swelling, blossoming, interweaving melody, from which arose in elegant counterpoint—at first only sporadic, but then ever more clear and vigorous—a great, old-fashioned, wonderful, and grandiose march, which moved toward a climax, intertwining, modulating, and finally resolving as the violin entered fortissimo
true, i have learned something about life, but that just makes the prospect of sitting around here at home like a silly goose all the more depressing
here one likewise experienced how behind a contemporary f��ade the depths of time are constantly interposing in soft ghostly tones, and not without also confronting the eye with enduring architectural tokens and even picturesquely breaching the present now and again in historical masquerade, in the folk costume of halle, in the garb of ancestral salt-workers
joachim’s feet seemed very large, his legs very thin—and they looked as if they had been wrapped, more for sport than for any military reason
hans castorp sat half propped up in bed, his head tilted to one side and a blurry look of fond devotion in his eyes, and he listened now to the harmonies drifting in through the open balcony door—though not without a mental shrug at the thought of settembrini’s babblings about music being politically suspect
life is not squeamish, and cares not a fig for morality
before she even had time to read the name, a gentleman appeared in the room—wearing a bell-shaped coat and pea-colored trousers
mynheer sat with his jaw slack, his hands palm down on the plaid traveling blanket spread over both his and clavdia’s knees
it was a baroque idea, but one deeply rooted in his nature-composed of arrogance, a recluse's shyness, the old-fashioned german provincialism of kaisersaschern, and an explicit cosmopolitanism
by autumn at the latest, he said, frau salomon would be back again—but then for good
whereas death had scorned christian and would only continue to tease him with fifty little tricks and pranks that would command no one’s respect
the pleural lining is covered by flesh, isolated, inaccessible—for good and all
they won’t obey my will, you see
the tonal space it provides is too limited
the same thing has just happened with you, my good engineer
he is the chief of police…
herr dieckmann, however, did not quite understand what he’d said, and so began to rattle off his menu
i can indeed depend on my good memory; moreover, right after reading the draft i put several things to paper for myself, in particular the passage about apostasy
and he wept … and in the next moment he no longer knew why he wept
nevertheless, he would have been unable to leave his dressing room if he knew he had left something undone or had done it a little too hastily, for fear of forfeiting that sense of freshness, calm, and wholeness—which he would lose in any case within an hour and would then have to patch and cobble as best he could
pastor pringsheim, who had pulled on his wrist-warmers, began to speak again
gerda is at the casino—for a violin concert by tamayo
he now set them on his lap on such occasions, which both parties found just as delightful, even more so
it hasn’t emptied out entirely yet
’mid these halls with laughter chiming,
i did not tell him that it was in fact he who was politicizing things, and that nowadays the word german was in no way synonymous with intellectual purity, but a party slogan
that much is perfectly obvious
and the main thing is that mother will not be upset by my taking such a step—no more today than she would be a year from now
once the dilation of the stomach had been cured without any alleviation of the headaches and severe attacks of nausea, he began to assign more and more of the ailment's symptoms to the brain-bolstered in this view by his patient's desperate need to be kept out of the light
but never wash them first, dear—the blood has to go in, too, mercy sake
this effect is preceded by a kind of bold running start in a dramatic parlando-an obvious reminiscence of the first violin's recitative in the last movement of beethoven's a major quartet-except that the grand phrase there is followed by somethi;g quite different from a festival of melody in which the parody of being carried away becomes passion of such serious intent that one feels somehow embarrassed
i may be forgiven for a more or less randomly directed polemic, but i regard it as barbarism, as inhumanity, to term as soullessness such longings for a soul-the longings of the little mermaid!
but in the darkness into which he fled to escape confusion, he could hear settembrini’s voice droning on in praise of literature
for as she charmed me, so did she work her charm and yielded to me in love-and i was initiate and the promise sealed
world, a far more european space than the political colossus to its north, where the word international has long been spoken as a slur and where gloomy provincialism has fouled the air and turned it musty
we first have to let darkness wash over our eyes to see anything—that’s obvious
deeply worried, i asked myself what efforts, what intellectual tricks, detours, and ironies would be necessary to save art, to reconquer it and achieve a work that as a travesty of innocence could still confess the state of comprehension from which it would be wrested!
the consul stood in front of her—appalled, dazed, close to shock—and said nothing
their inedibility is known throughout the natural world, however, and they are secure-sadly secure
tacked to the wall above it was an arithmetical etching that he had found in some curio shop or other: a so-called magic square, like the one visible in durer's melancolia-along with hour-glass, compass, balance scales, polyhedron, and other symbols
he walked over to the glass door leading to a narrow veranda and gazed out at the soggy front yard for a few minutes
while day after day, in a constant state of silent agitation, i have faithfully attempted to do justice to my biographical task, to give worthy form to intimate and personal matters, i have simply let happen those outside events that are part of the age in which i write
his conduct, to be sure, never dissuaded me from my observation that from the very first day he dearly loved his little nephew, that the boy's arrival had brought a radiant daylight into his life
he is well known for his method of rhythmically modifying a fugue theme in the very first answer, in such a way that, although the thematic is strictly maintained, it can no longer be recognized as a repetition
this incurred the censure of sor alfo, who felt that in so doing the jurist-quest' uomo, he would say on such occasions-was presuming a bit too much
just lazin’ through my day,
finally they left the room to make way for an old woman, a disagreeable creature, who kept rubbing her toothless gums together and had come to help sister leandra wash and dress the body
moreover, not satisfied with just composing a hymn entitled to the fatherland for male chorus, he even wanted to dedicate it to the german kaiser
you were taking your life in your hands—a devil on the right, a devil on the left, how in the hell were you supposed to survive?
yet another guest, the art historian and diirer scholar, professor gilgen holzschuher, made me feel uneasy for similar reasons that i find it hard to justify; and that was doubly true for the poet daniel zur hohe, who was also often in attendance-a gaunt thirtyyear-old clad in clerical black up to his tight collar, with the profile of a bird of prey and a hammering way of speaking that went something like:  indeed, indeed, not bad, no doubt at all, one can well say that!
he did this with a metal whistle whose tone was adjustable by a screw and that could produce a frequency so high that the human ear barely perceived it even at close range, whereas its effect on the quite differently evolved eardrum of a dog was very powerful, even from astonishing distances, and kaschperl would keep still as a mouse whenever the secret tone that no one else could hear pierced the night
but now hans castorp realized to his amazement that the flush that had come to his freshly shaven cheeks had not subsided, or at least the warmth that had come with it was not about to depart—the same hot, dry face that had bothered him yesterday evening, and that had disappeared while he slept, was back now in full force
in any case, those words had spoken of liberated music's never extinguished homesickness for origins still bound to the cult; and beethoven's violent attempts at the fugue had been those of a great dynamic and emotional spirit wrestling with an ingeniously cool compositional form that upon its knees had praised god, the orderer of the cosmos and all its many rounds, yet all the while had been caught up in another world of passionsstrict, highly abstract, ruled by numbers and a chiming relationship with time
but then she continued, as lively as before, but, tom, you really needn’t see it that way
but god gave you both a child, the consul said, deeply touched
it all belongs to the realm of the intellect and has nothing to do with either of you personally, which is the only way something can be an insult
his name would be called out and he would stand up and not know a single line—and there would be a scene, a loud and terrible catastrophe, no matter how good a mood the professor was in
and jurisprudence, the making and executing of laws?
only the briefest, highly compact musical moment is genuine and serious
let me tell you something, he said in conclusion—they had arrived in joachim’s room, and his cousin was getting ready for rest cure
having again consulted only a leipzig street directory, he now sought treatment from a certain dr zimbalist, who resided on one of the commercial streets that converge at market square
there really is some resemblance—i’ve never been in a monastery, but i can imagine it’s much like here
his nose looked like a little flat button between his protruding cheekbones, and his gray eyes squinted and blinked in all directions a little stupidly, although at certain moments they could unexpectedly grow larger and larger, sticking out until they almost popped
it’s certainly prettier than if your name was jack or joe
let me feel, my child
say what you like, there is something pleasant about waking of a morning in a large bedroom with lovely, cheerful wallpaper and finding that the first thing you touch is a heavy satin quilt; and it is exceptional to have an early breakfast in a room opening onto a terrace, with the fresh morning air drifting in from the front garden through an open glass door, and to be served neither coffee, nor tea, but a cup of chocolate—yes, every morning, a cup of birthday chocolate, with a thick moist piece of pound cake
she expatiated on the pleasures of coughing—yes, there was something perfectly delightful and enjoyable about a tickle in the depths of your chest, that got worse and worse until you reached down deep for it, squeezing and pressing to let it have its way
remarkably enough, both our pastor, the reverend rector zwilling and
after a proper period of silence, he replied, my good engineer, i have not the remotest desire to disconcert or offend you in your protestantism
old buddenbrook repeated with a giggle
i’ve always been a great concertgoer, he said
and the closer election day drew near, the clearer it became that he and hermann hagenström had the best chances
and he wasn’t even wearing an overcoat
what do you know, she’s emerged from beyond the caucasus again
his hands, however, were genteel and long-fingered, with beautifully shaped oval and convex nails; and the finished effect was so undeniably that of a gentleman that he could dare to wear his informal street clothes to affairs where evening dress was the rule-and at such receptions, women preferred him just as he was to his rivals in correct black and white, and one would see him surrounded by females whose admiration was undisguised
his father was born on a norwegian ship, and ended up a captain on the same line
we no longer need indulge ourselves in dialectic extravagance for your sake
it was both tender and full at the same time—and cool, one could only presume
but if i use it, then i feel i’ve done my duty and that everything is in order; my conscience is clear, and i feel calm and content, and swallowing is absolutely effortless
timm sat down beaming with pride, and dr mantelsack apparently jotted down satisfactory beside his name
but on foot, how far is it then?
