and yet that question contains one of the great mysteries on which our world is founded
he kept his study locked so no one could see it
i felt he’d come and obviously he wouldn’t come for nothing, so he must have some news for me!
the explanation is that dmitry and mrs khokhlakov had all but broken off relations during the past month, that they had never been very closely acquainted even before, and that he was very well aware of the fact that she had never been able to stand him anyway
i overslept, makar dear
ivan never talks to me about dmitry’s case, he said slowly
it pains me to look at you, i said
if he had, i suppose i would have been forced to tell him about meeting her yesterday
our courtroom is the best hall in town: it is spacious, has high ceilings and excellent acoustics
although this did strike me as rather peculiar (and later i thought about it a great deal), at the moment i was too preoccupied and too ill at ease to concentrate on anything
one point in perkhotin’s account particularly impressed both the prosecutor and the examining magistrate, and that was his insistence that dmitry karamazov would shoot himself at dawn, that dmitry had made up his mind, had told perkhotin about it, had loaded his pistol in his presence, had written a note that he had put in his pocket; and when perkhotin, still refusing to believe that dmitry would really shoot himself, had said that he would get help to prevent him from going through with it, dmitry karamazov had grinned and replied that it would be too late by then
but the moving chants brought him back to reality with a shock
indeed, i even exaggerated in the presence of strangers just to show them how much at ease i felt
mitya urged him on nervously
quite the contrary, mr karamazov, you express it very well, nelyudov assented with approving dignity
oh, i am so unhappy because of this miserable, terrible character of mine!
ah, get out of my sight, you clown!
how is it you forgot to mention it?
the next day she’d go into her hysterical screaming like a village girl
i simply waved my hand, which was trembling now, in a gesture of never mind
you know, i have not undressed all night because of a suicide, i remarked in a casual tone and, as he made a proper show of curiosity, i told him briefly what had happened
still, thanks, i appreciate it
he remembered that there were several tall, thick elder and guelder-rose bushes growing right under the windows
is something wrong with mother?
that is, not russia, but all these birchings, floggings, although, yes, i must say i loathe russia too
a buxom, natural beauty—makes you drool just to look at her
why have you turned so red, lisa?
listen, perkhotin, i love a woman
it was so absurd, your mentioning pistols, arkady; nothing of that sort is necessary, and i know very well what he will do
are the shutters bolted, fenya?
i tore up the stairs and by the time i would reached the door, all my fears were gone
yes, i do love her, and perhaps more than i love all the rest of you put together
i will have the letter shown to the prince by a third person
suspicion has fallen on him too
only now do i know the answer: it was because of my idea
whom will he praise in his hymns?
the quiet, harmonious, ringing voice with that metallic quality about it!
it woke the baby next door, who began to cry
i mention that insignificant incident with the wretched former officer intentionally, for in order to understand versilov thoroughly one must know the minutest details of the circumstances at that moment, a moment that was to prove crucial for him, although i had no idea of it at the time
he seemed to have regained control over himself
i am glad you are properly dressed
alyosha heard the voice reading
i’ll go and get myself some wine now
she’s offended you, but you mustn’t be angry
that would be salvation for you, and especially for your little boy
when i opened the door, i saw him literally jumping out into the passage: he must have been physically ejected by the two ladies!
i asked myself cheerfully, although i knew full well that what happened today would affect the rest of my life decisively and irreversibly
this made me feel very sad, sorry for him, and ashamed of something, all at the same time
the doctor glanced at him
i stamped my foot under the desk
it amazes me now when i think of it—this anger and desire for revenge quite pained and sickened me, for, being by nature rather easy-going, i could not be angry with anyone for long and so i had to kindle these feelings artificially, which made me quite unbearable and absurd
according to mrs prutkov, during this last year he had increasingly lost interest in his appearance and, although he was still decently dressed, his suits began to look old and he wore them without his former distinction
lise said guardedly in a very quiet voice
then he put both elbows on the little round table and leaned his head on his hands
there’s such terrible grief there and now they’re supposed to eat those pancakes
oh, these people learn from childhood, from their mothers' knee, how to offend others!
i cried in amazement
it was a huge photograph, obviously taken abroad, in an exquisitely carved wooden frame
(i am writing down verbatim the words lambert uttered in my dream)
it was really funny the way you jumped up in defense of mrs akhmakov
and, with a sweeping gesture of condemnation, he turned around, walked out of the cell, and went quickly down the few steps into the yard
as he caught dmitry’s dangling foot, when dmitry was already sitting astride the fence
he went to the opposite side of the table, pulled up a chair, and sat down
there you go again, the elder said, smiling gently
what is all this?
fyodor karamazov, the unhappy victim in this murder trial, is an innocent babe compared with some
alyosha stepped outside and signaled to the coachman to drive up to the steps
my friends, pray to god for joy
is that you, grushenka?
i’ve left my purse behind
during our drive, trishatov told me rather breathlessly that there had been some sort of a deal between lambert and pockmarked semyon but that the pockmarked one had changed his mind at the last moment and had now sent trishatov to mrs prutkov to warn her not to believe what alphonsine might tell her and to beware of lambert
stop that, gregory, don’t keep abusing him like that, mr karamazov interrupted him
i understand that it would be an indiscretion on your part
we have been granted what we may call an audience’ by the person in question and, therefore, grateful though we are to you for showing us the way, we won’t be able to invite you to come in with us
but at least i will remember that i refused to sit down with you because i was still aware of my moral degradation that made me unworthy
you must understand that the future of this saintly, this most noble man, who has been injured by ingratitude, is now in your hands
i’m sorry, gentlemen, i’m wrong again
but you mustn’t call him that; he may resent it
oh lord, may man dissolve in prayer!
kolya sat on the bed beside ilyusha and said:
gradually the uncertainty of the situation began to weigh on him and he became very despondent
to whom will he come if he cannot find his father and mother together?
the dog leaped up squealing with joy, as snegirev appeared with a piece of meat
do not you think, tatyana, he always looks as though he had something so important on his mind that this somehow makes him ill at ease?
he loved both his brothers and the possibility of such a rivalry frightened him
but he didn’t do it
so you would better be warned
i would have left it out of my narrative altogether had it not strongly affected my principal hero—or rather my future principal hero—alyosha, bringing him to a turning point and giving him a violent shock, but as a final result strengthening his resolution to pursue his goal to the end
that’s what i want, and that’s what i’ll do!
do you like small children, alyosha?
the document is in my hand
i hurried home and, strange to say, i was very pleased with myself
and now i’ll be able to tell mitya about you kissing my hand while i wouldn’t kiss yours
father ferapont asked him after a brief silence
everything is nonsense, such nonsense you can’t even imagine!
the moment i start wanting to understand something, i distort the true picture, when what i really want is to stick to the facts
no, sir, not to mr lambert
i also told vasin what stebelkov had said about the baby
well, i guess you’d better stay here then, she said with a smile
but you must never forget me, papa, ilyusha said
gregory still said nothing
but what did smerdyakov say to you?
that much i understood
yes, yes, let’s go back to mamma, snegirev said, suddenly remembering her
but, no, of course it wasn’t the same thing at all!
however, if i have decided to mention them here, it's only because that finnish cook was destined to play a fateful role in my story later
perhaps they won’t beat us to mokroye by even as much as half an hour!
so let him give me just three thousand for the twenty-eight, only three, and take my soul out of a living hell—he’ll have many of his sins forgiven him if he does that
it was because you were so mean that i lost all five of my little ones
but his character was the same as before he had left for moscow: he was still as unsociable as ever and seemed to have no need whatever for anyone’s company
thank goodness, that business has been settled in court
how could you do such a thing!
they are the most dangerous!
i hope you will accept these flowers, sofia, he said
and please forgive me, kraft, for coming to your house and talking nonsense
but now, for a brief moment only, let there be something that could have been, she said with a twisted smile, looking happily into his eyes
tell me in two words what you want of me, just two words, do you understand!
eventually everything will be smoothed out and washed clean
in the meantime mr karamazov, having seen his son off, felt very pleased
i have been looking for the janitor for a whole hour, she said
mitya shouted in a resounding voice:
ah, alyosha, it’s such a pity you don’t really know what exaltation is!
i stopped abruptly: the meaning of what i was saying suddenly dawned on me
old prince sokolsky treated her with extraordinary consideration, as did his family; and versilov's proud legitimate children did too; the same was true of the fanariotovs
thus arrayed, the body was placed toward morning in a coffin that had been prepared long in advance
if i’ve killed him, i’ve killed him
i’ve been dealing with gorstkin for a long time, you know
if i continue to sit here and allow you to go on talking about the persons you have mentioned, and even if i answer you, it's not because i grant you that right
versilov has been counting on that inheritance
i’m quite all right really
she listened to this wild talk with wide-open eyes
this was another trait that was very characteristic of him—he never cared whose money he lived on
so he firmly and ardently determined to disregard his promises to go and see his father, his brother, the khokhlakovs, and katerina, and to stay with his elder in the monastery until the end
besides, he felt it was quite ridiculous that he should offer his opinion about a woman, as though he were an expert in such matters
it's impossible for a son to talk to his father, or to anybody else, about his relations with a woman, even if they are of the purest kind
when i analyze it now, i see that what charmed me most in him was his humble sincerity with me, a mere adolescent!
now, at least, that horrible ghost of the past had been destroyed; her first, unchallengeable love had dissolved into thin air; the man who had played such a fateful part in her life had turned into a wretched caricature and was now locked in a bedroom
just a minute, kraft, you have mentioned people who worry about what will happen in a thousand years
i may be a hallucination of yours, but, just as in a nightmare, i can say original things that have never even occurred to you and i don’t necessarily have to repeat your old ideas, even if i am nothing but a nightmarish figment of your imagination
he also had a message for her
you mean your father?
he could break into the house, dash through the rooms, push his father out of his way, even hit him
when, then, the prosecutor asked him what grounds he had for asserting that fyodor karamazov had acted dishonestly toward his son with regard to that estate, gregory, to everyone’s surprise, was unable to offer any support for his statement but simply insisted that the settlement was unfair and that the father ought to have paid the son a few thousand more
he is filled with the best of intentions and is a very sensitive person, vasin said, but he is neither reasonable nor strong-willed enough to control his whims
let her think that i am a horrid young fool who's been spying on her and scheming, but i want her to recognize that in the end i have conquered myself and put her happiness above everything else in the world
ivan and alyosha then went back to the living room
i have heard about all that, my boy, people have told me many times about these things
usually he was much more cheerful and relaxed
mitya was now very frightened of grushenka, anticipating that the pole would make a scene
but why is he better than me?
i was moved to tears, arkady, because i ca not think what i have done to deserve such warm affection on your part
no, you are an ungrateful little beast, that's what you are!
this was the same night, perhaps even the very same hour, that alyosha threw himself down on the ground and ecstatically vowed to love the earth forever and ever
she kept bombarding me with questions
where was i off to?
if it hadn’t been for gregory, there would have been no one to change the boy’s shirt
there is confusion among the people, shouting and weeping
and this is what actually hurt me most: how could it be that everyone else knew about it except me?
i have no idea really why i have lived
what possible reason could you have had for agreeing to go to chermashnya then, instead of going to moscow, just because i asked you to?
i don’t believe it’s possible to live in rebellion, and i want to live!
are you really leaving town very soon?
he thrust the twenty-five-ruble bill into his pocket, feeling terribly awkward in front of alyosha
i’ll go wherever you wish, madam, but now
he's stuffed with thousands of preconceptions and extraordinary notions, but there's not one original idea in his head
kalganov seemed irritated at something, while maximov was laughing
now, if you could convince me, arkady, that this family is an exception, an accident, i would be very relieved
then he replaced the pistols in the case, locked the case with a little key, and picked it up
you might be his father or something
you know, lisa, although i had words with him this morning—as you may perhaps have heard—i am still sincerely fond of him and wish him luck
i cried, glaring savagely at stebelkov
he was very closely shaven except for neatly trimmed whiskers that looked like two thin sausages suspended on each side of his flat and evil-looking face
i didn’t have to tell you
for a few days after that, we would get together and talk about it, secretly as it were, and that was all we talked about
so we have here a second reason impelling him to hold on jealously to the money sewn in the bag, not to open the bag, and certainly not to fish out one hundred-ruble bill after another
i was involved in a terrible mixture of twisted emotions and heartbreak
he would take her away at once
dmitry might be lying in wait for her somewhere, so as soon as she knocked on the window (smerdyakov had told him two days ago that he had explained to her where and how to knock) he would have to let her in at once, without wasting a second, for who knew what might happen otherwise?
there seems to be reservation in your praise
and what about the pestle?
he declared at the preliminary hearing and he was still trembling all over as he spoke to us, although by then the man who had terrorized him was safely under lock and key and could no longer harm him
she has a degree and is impatient to return to petersburg and fight for women’s rights on the banks of the neva
everything is turning, turning, the stove is turning
apparently everything was not in order in the second cart, in which two men with brass badges were to accompany the rural police officer
do you really imagine that i could not bear the emancipation of the serfs?
i helped timofei harness and i know which way he went
and, just as he would expected, at two o'clock in the afternoon he received a visit from a certain baron r, a forty-year-old colonel, one of those german barons of whom there are so many in the russian service, who are full of their baronial arrogance though penniless, who have to live on their pay and are the most zealous sticklers for rules and regulations
and he remembered all those he had wronged and tried to make it up to them
but of late sergei seemed to be changing, as did his feelings toward versilov
can’t you look where you’re walking, you hooligan!
i said, waving him away, feeling on the verge of tears
we will see about that later
there are people, women especially, whom it helps to talk and talk when they are struck by a catastrophe; also there are some people who have been, as it were, worn away by misery, who have been hurt too often during their lifetime, who have suffered terrible disasters and experienced constant hardships, and who, even within the sight of the dead body of a loved one, never forget the dearly acquired art of getting along with others
for they keep on reading all their lives and, having filled themselves with bookish wisdom, they talk and talk, although they never find answers to what's bothering them and remain in the darkness
mitya made everyone stop dancing and be quiet
all right, he said, i will reveal my secret to you and tell you where the money came from; i will expose myself to shame and disgrace so that later i can’t accuse either myself or you
and that's what enraged me most!
it’s really incredible that it should have come back to me only now!
feeling that lise did not want to waste the time that her mother was out of the room, he told her briefly and with many omissions, but quite clearly and matter-of-factly, about his strange adventure with the schoolboys
and you did so while in a state of tremendous agitation and while trying to escape?
he knew that big wooden inn very well, with all its barns, sheds, and verandahs
many said of the elder that, in accepting all those who had come throughout the years to entrust their souls to him, to seek his guidance and solace, he had heard so many confessions, secrets, and tales of human despair that he had finally acquired an insight so keen that he could guess, from the very first glance at a newcomer, what he would say, what he would ask him, and even what was really tormenting his conscience
prevent me from being generous and magnanimous
but who cares really because everything is so awfully nice
he glared challengingly at his interrogators
he decided, feeling really sick now; but instead of walking away, he began to bang wildly on the gate
so i never gave it a thought when, to my great surprise, i began noticing certain signs
it’s a funny law too
and this time it’s the truth
in real life, thousands of things may have happened that would have escaped the scrutiny of the subtlest fiction writer
i feel very guilty toward him
the wise and dreaded spirit of self-destruction and nonexistence,  the old man went on, spoke to you in the desert and we learn from the books that he tried to tempt you
with what ye mete, it shall be measured to you again
the apartment was still under mrs prutkov's supervision
what i actually want to tell you was that in case of—let’s call it an emergency—i mean when they ask your papa to produce those four-and-a-half thousand that he doesn’t have, well, rather than let him be court-martialed and demoted to the ranks in his old age, i suggest you secretly send me your learned little sister, because i’ve just received some money and i guess i could let her have, say, four thousand
unless he wants to kill bjoring?
every time i came to see you, i suspected that the only reason you received me so nicely was to find out whatever i might know about that document, to reduce me to a state in which i would have to tell you everything
when he first arrived in our town, his father questioned him suspiciously, trying to find out just what had brought him here before he had finished school
live as long as you can
he was standing at an angle to father paisii and he did not turn to face him fully
the lady had detested him from the very beginning, simply because he was engaged to katerina, who, she had for some reason decided, should break off with him and marry his brother ivan instead, such a nice, chivalrous, cultured man with such charming manners
it is also true that, at the same moment, the spilt blood was crying out for vengeance, for he was now a man who had lost his soul and his right to live on earth; and he knew that, as of this moment, he was just nothing to the being he loved more than his soul, now that her first and rightful’ one had come back to her and was prepared to make up to her the harm he had done her and offer her a new and happy life!
he’s never mentioned you at all as far as i know
mitya, who’s that looking at us from over there?
alyosha suddenly remembered that, as he was leaving the summer house the day before, he had noticed a low, green garden bench by the fence, half concealed under the bushes
mitya could not even consider him as a man now, for everyone in town knew that samsonov was a wreck, whose relations with grushenka could only be those of a father with his daughter—not at all what they had been before—and that it had been that way for quite some time already, almost a whole year
in the morning i sent a note to someone, asking him to come and see me without fail
so you’re saving me already!
mrs prutkov and miss anna are great friends now
sergei hesitated, it could have been
the grand inquisitor falls silent and waits for some time for the prisoner to answer
i shouted and ran out again
you called me a spy just now!
yes, i only care for you and for some slut i’ve fallen in love with, who will drive me to my perdition
are you really matthew?
and it might have robbed me of his love too
i’ve come, madam
however, this poor young man deserved infinitely better of life, for he had a good heart when he was a child and even when he was no longer a child
then he also made the necessary inquiries to check whether all the persons whose names i had tossed around in my babbling really existed
and it's not only for the reader's sake
yes, but i hit smurov in the head!
i can understand the concept of solidarity in sin and also solidarity in retribution
although obviously i could not have left with it
vasin, however, also picked up his cap to leave at the same time
all right, then, let's change the setting
i’ll be able to talk to her now, for yesterday she insisted that i come and see her today
he had once consulted the moscow doctor whom katerina had invited to our town, following through on an idea i have already mentioned
but i wo not even sit down
and tears gushed from her eyes as she clung to mitya’s hand, never relaxing her grip
so let there be no more of this, monks, let there be no more brutalized children; rise up against it, preach against it, hasten to do so!
do not you see that by publicizing your illegitimacy, which in itself was slander, you were violating your mother's secret and, for the perverse satisfaction of your own false pride, you were placing her at the mercy of anyone who wanted to throw dirt at her!
of course he won’t, i know it only too well
they stood there looking into each other’s eyes
i would seen it before and had noticed it again three days earlier while walking through the museum
so you give him a punch in the face
no, to you, to you
the presiding judge still sounded distrustful
he let out a mirthless little laugh, looking sort of sideways, away from her
and perezvon was supposed to remain like this without moving for any length of time—as long as half an hour, kolya claimed—until his master ordered him to move
alyosha asked, looking thoughtfully at his brother
there are a few things i’ll tell them there
i still remember, detail by detail, everything about that day!
he could always stop himself before breaking the law and, at times, he wondered at that himself
and you’d still be carrying my little notes when you were forty
lambert shouted, panic-stricken, grabbing me by the sleeve of my coat
i have brought you here because of a whim of my heart
and now i want to end, gentlemen, with a plea: please, gentlemen, try to unlearn once and for all the prescribed methods for conducting interrogations!
i simply respect people who are competent
i never even suspected in what a false position i was; i swear to god i had no inkling of what mattered to him most!
the little peasant who had been hired to drive the second cart and was putting on his coat was still arguing that akim should be the one to drive the cart and not him
although they just may go your way
i will use our special language to make her understand that the document is safe and that she must be here tomorrow morning at ten, at ten o'clock sharp
later the same day, he had gone to see father ferapont in his isolated cell behind the apiary, and the visit had made a tremendous and terrifying impression on him
that his loathing would perhaps get the better of him, and then he could kill him
during all this time, smerdyakov, pale and trembling, had stayed in the opposite corner of the room, huddling close to mr karamazov
i guess i must have hit the ground with the back of my head and remained unconscious a minute or two
something frightfully dramatic must have happened between the two of them!
as to having me locked up, you only want it done because you’re jealous of me, because you’ve been chasing after that woman yourself
i’d never dare tell gregory about the signals unless the master ordered me to
the prosecutor frowned violently
i didn’t even dare tell my brother alyosha about the fifteen hundred rubles, so horrible did it feel to be a crook and a thief!
when, after his talk with alyosha, ivan reached the house where he lived and, about to ring the bell at the gate, pulled his hand back and decided to go and see smerdyakov instead, he was yielding to a sudden angry impulse
i close my eyes and let my imagination wander, and during those minutes i feel an irresistible strength within me
see me off now
he would been converted to catholicism while abroad
indeed, she went so far that the boys ended up by teasing kolya precisely because of her, taunting him with being a sissy and a mummy’s boy
but tell me, have you ever tried to tempt those who feed on locusts, pray in the desert for seventeen years, and are overgrown with moss?
do you think you have the right to reveal even a single mystery of the world from which you come?
i have noted down a detailed account of a well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife flogging their own seven-year-old daughter
moreover, the shop-assistant, who had been out of the shop during the murder, not only told the police the exact sum missing, but also described the bills and the coins, that is, the number of rainbow-colored bills, blue, ten-ruble bills, red, five-ruble bills, how many gold coins and of what denominations
the same discrediting technique was applied to the poles, who came in with haughty and arrogant airs, declared that they were servants of the crown, that the accused had tried to buy their honor for three thousand rubles, and that they themselves had seen him holding in his hands large sums of money
today, it may be a lady, but tomorrow a whore may take her place
what a sweet boy!
so he would have to face her all alone
he kept tormenting himself terribly, she said
in fact, he was an obstinate and at times brash man who talked with self-assurance, was very definite in his judgments, and lived respectfully, as he put it rather strangely
it’s the fact that you could have the same dream as i had
how could you not forgive her after she said to you herself, forgive me’?
but there was something in that smile that was anything but friendly
i’m sure that a thinker of your caliber must approach every social phenomenon with a perfectly open mind and have a very unprejudiced view of things
rakitin cannot understand that
was shouted from the crowd
let's go then, he said with an obvious effort
'we will pay him back first thing when i get a job and he will see that we are as honest as we are proud, which he already understood
because i would discovered what an extraordinary and noble person you are
he was filled, however, with a vague, entirely different sort of apprehension
but is that the truth?
but at that moment something almost unbelievably absurd took place, a worthy finale to the whole preposterous episode
that’s what smerdyakov says
what are you afraid of?
but you may very well have decided that i am a pig, because it would have been difficult to behave worse than i did
the next day i told myself that the incident was closed, over and done with, and that there must be no sequel to it
and that relative of hers, the rich general’s widow, not only gave katya her blessing, but even went so far as to congratulate her, believe it or not
i walked over to him, but he threw a stone at me too and then another one, aimed at my head
you know how beautiful she is
you’ll hear me out, you’ll understand, and you’ll forgive
but i was in a hurry to convince them, to beat them at their own game
and, if i may, i’d like to come back sometime and talk to you about it some more
several boys from ilyusha’s class were visiting him and every one of them, like smurov, would have angrily denied that it was alyosha who had made peace between him and ilyusha and that, if he was there now, it was because of alyosha
then he remembered and said to god: once,  he said, she pulled up an onion in her garden and gave it to a beggar woman
kraft tore it up
he poured oil on the flames
that’s rebellion, alyosha said softly, lowering his eyes
i am sure it's utter nonsense
but you must have gathered that much yourself, i am sure
you mean about my prostrating myself before him for the money?
it meant a lot to me because versilov came there on his own initiative to see me after our quarrel and then returned many times
so you’re absolutely convinced that someone was here with you?
i did promise
mind you, according to smerdyakov, the money was under the mattress, and the accused is supposed to have pulled it out from under the mattress
tell me, how did you manage to get here so quickly?
where could he get three thousand?
i have sinned, my father, and i’m afraid of my sin
smerdyakov sat on the bench by the garden gate, enjoying the cool evening air, and ivan at once realized that it was this man who had been weighing on his mind, that he could not bear the very idea that this creature existed
lise, for heaven’s sake, stop that screaming!
alphonsine screamed and squealed desperately, but we paid no attention to her, and i am not sure whether she turned her cab around to follow us or drove on home
a widely scattered mass of completely black houses was emerging from the paler darkness of the night
yes, mr miusov, you were the cause of my terrible fall
but at the moment it only added to my shame and embarrassment: they are looking at us from up there
for whom will man love then?
and the painting must be big as they come, do not forget
how could anybody help liking you?
the day the mother embraces the man who had her son torn to pieces by the hounds, the day those three stand side by side and say, you were right, o lord,  that day we will at last have attained the supreme knowledge and everything will be explained and accounted for
the monks would have objected
now you’re just talking nonsense and i don’t know what you mean by it, he said quietly but threateningly
i exclaimed in some kind of a trance, my eyes sparkling wildly
god wants to warn us, they said, and to many this argument seemed irrefutable
well, it was certainly not through any fault of mine: all i could tell in her presence, i told well and eloquently
and lise too will start despising me soon
nothing would make me leave!
others do not devote poems to them, but they can’t look at them without inner commotion
please sit down, we are all friends here
the whole thing turned into a real comedy!
i felt an irresistible urge for exercise
i am ready, and now we can get it over with very quickly because—listen to me—since i now know that i’m not guilty, we can certainly finish it up in a few minutes, can’t we?
they remembered that, then, they had put ice on his head and, since there was still some ice in the cellar, martha did the same now
katya, mitya suddenly asked her, did you believe i killed him?
i must make it clear from the outset that i feel unable to give a really complete account of all that happened during the trial or, for that matter, to report the events in their proper sequence
perhaps i am already in a madhouse
he was not really worried by his father’s order that he move back home, mattress, pillow, and all—he understood very well that a command shouted out like that was just his father’s way of showing off and enjoying the sheer beauty of the gesture
but what's coming over me now?
i did not want to tell him that they had not let me come near him
but secretly he was very eager to meet alyosha as there appeared to be something very attractive and interesting about him, to judge from all the stories
in that case, i could see and touch the money, and i could not deny its existence, which is very different from the case at hand
we need her badly because it is thanks to her meekness that god tolerates us and, without her constant angelic kindness, our house would have become a real hell; she makes us all gentler, even barbara
but before they got to him, makar, pushing hard on his crutch, had managed to raise himself and was looking around with a triumphant and laughing expression
and of you, mother, i have a clear picture only during one second: they took me to church once to receive the sacrament and you picked me up so i could receive the host and kiss the chalice
he thought all these considerations might bring pressure to bear upon the elder from within the monastery
why, if she said to him: i want nothing to do with your father
exhausted, she closed her eyes and seemed to doze off for a minute
in his words and in the inflections of his rather strident voice could be detected a sort of cracked, fool’s humor, now wicked, now timorous, never maintaining the same tone and constantly breaking off
what’s the matter, lise, have you gone quite mad?
oh, how inquisitive you are yourself, rakitin
allow me to kiss your hand once more!
i love those sticky little leaves in the spring and the blue sky, that’s what!
at one point he passed very close to his father’s house, as he crossed the yard of a little old house with four windows that stood next to karamazov’s property
including the coffin, the burial, the doctor, the flowers, and the money given to the carpenter's wife, i would say, all told, it came to about thirty rubles
then it suddenly dawned on him that where he really wanted to go was to old karamazov’s house, to find out whether anything had happened there
i raised myself and looked up
they were dumbfounded by me now
it’s a fact that i misbehave this way because i’m oversensitive
but where on earth did you get all this stuff from?
i did not have the courage
and how could i explain to my boy why i accepted your money for having been disgraced!
he hired ordinary russian workers, who came with their spades, and he made them dig a deep hole just by the edge of the stone
but from the very outset of his legal career, this sickly man had been unable to command the respect due his talents, and he never managed to close this gap later
why, there have been so many ideas in the history of man, ideas that would have seemed inconceivable ten years before, but that suddenly took root and flourished when, by some mysterious process, the time was ripe for them—and they quickly swept the earth
it happened quite recently and it gave me a great deal of trouble
what use would you be to me if you already had propensities for ruthlessness?
i got to vasin's house, which was in fontanka near the semyonovsky bridge, exactly at noon, but he was out
and that's why innumerable papas may repeat for centuries on end those two magic key words of the secret without managing to produce another james rothschild
but there were no lines around her big, wide-open eyes, from which shone a quiet and gentle light, eyes that had drawn me to her from the very first day
i felt utterly embarrassed
her young heart, which had perhaps once contained much that was good, was thus very early in life filled with angry resentment
no, after all, i can’t stand you!
wait, i’ll get it out of the cupboard
you’re really just like the rest of them
how many souls, for instance, had to be destroyed, how many reputations ruined for the sake of the righteous job, over whom i was so utterly swindled long ago!
however, it still remains unclear to me why, instead of devoting himself to the poor imbecile, he did not give a thought to my mother, who was waiting for him in konigs-berg
as a rule, the monks gathered in the elder’s cell in the evening just before they separated for the night, and each monk confessed aloud the sins he had committed that day, his sinful desires, his thoughts and temptations, and also his quarrels with his brother monks, if there had been any
the world beyond’ and material proof—a peculiar combination that only men would think up!
they’ll pray for him there
i never expected we could quarrel about this!
before we would driven a quarter of the way to lambert's, i heard my name called out behind me
they had never spoken to each other, but somehow he had long felt that the old seducer, now a dying man, would not object to grushenka’s settling down to an honest life and marrying a reliable man
where is she then?
is that what you mean, mother?
t do not care how expensive it is!
this immediately attracts me to people, only up to a point of course
ah, lise, don’t scream like that
fenya came in with the uncorked bottle of champagne and three glasses on a tray
still, eventually the baby was not sent off to a foundling home
and, really, versilov is
where are you going?
there were many stern and frowning faces, some of them outright hostile
go on, why don’t you say that too?
that was what maxim skotoboinikov had to say about the afimievsk people and, although it was not kind what he said, there was truth in it: they were an unreliable lot and could not control themselves
he watched her with boundless admiration as she sipped champagne from her glass
and when he said that, he got up and left
later there was a fire in the village of voskova—that's downstream from the town—and nine houses burned down from top to bottom
i realize how stupid it would have been, but i suppose it was the sheer ecstasy of the moment
so i would like to know what it is you want
all i claim to know is that laughter is the most reliable gauge of human nature
the way you put it, it was as if i had the three thousand in my pocket
i’m pretty sure he’ll take it tomorrow, alyosha said, pacing the room, his face concentrated in thought
for how could god almighty treat a tartar, who was brought before him, like a christian?
the young woman cried out in sincere repentance when he was arrested
i know a lawyer in kursk province—i knew him when we were boys—and i have been assured by a reliable person that if i could get there, he would take me on as a clerk in his office
he’ll save me from him, save me forever
he actually felt reassured now that he was reasonably convinced that the murderer was his brother dmitry rather than smerdyakov, although it would seem more reasonable for him to have been more upset
they found it only later in the morning, vasin explained
arkady is searching for beauty, i suddenly hear anna's voice coming from somewhere close by
i am sincerely fond of men and in many respects i’ve been slandered
alyosha followed him for a while with his eyes, unable to believe that his brother would leave him like that
besides, he’s no longer an army officer—he’s been working for the customs office in siberia lately, somewhere on the chinese border, i believe, just a lousy little polack customs official
i suffered because of her, and she did her best to torment me
all monday and tuesday i heard him singing in his room the bridegroom cometh, and i enjoyed both the tune and the verses tremendously
perkhotin’s surprise grew when he saw a whole wad of bills in dmitry’s hand
i’d just like to share a small observation with you, ivan answered immediately, namely, that for a long time european liberals and even our native russian liberal dilettantes have frequently confused the final results of socialism and of christianity
you were right, trishatov!
it was this that gregory had mentioned when mr karamazov and ivan were sitting at table
there is no knowledge that could supply them with bread as long as they remain free
there was nothing so unusual in his taking money from me, grushenka said, smiling in contemptuous disgust
as katerina had thought, alyosha did not get there in time
well, of course, i took only one detail out of the whole picture but, as you know, every detail is compositionally connected with all the others by indestructible links
the time came to carry the coffin out, but snegirev would not budge from it
even though sin and injustice and temptation are all around us, we know that there is on this earth a holy man, a saint who is just and knows the truth, and this means that truth and justice have not vanished from the earth and so will come to us too and rule over all the world, as has been promised
and what could smerdyakov have possibly told her?
but i’ll come to that later, although it is what concerns me most of all
we’ll be waiting for you, he concluded firmly, and left the house
a nightingale was singing in a moscow cafe when a merchant walked in
for that’s your way of praying to god, and watching you makes me happy and in my happiness i pray for you too, which means that both of us are praying to the same god
there was a sudden wave of sympathy for mitya
he hurried over there, hoping to get the business out of the way quickly so that he wouldn’t be late visiting mitya in prison
oh, not my mother and sister—them, i would never abandon, however things turned out
i’m terribly sorry
i won’t get into trouble for it there
so i could weep and i wept for their old idea, and, indeed, i may have actually wept real tears and i am not saying this just to be dramatic
it does not to you because you just had dinner
so those who think they do not need god are really just idol worshipers, and that's what we should call them
even before i was questioned then, i had been told what had happened when he was arrested and how he had accused smerdyakov
but, instead, the door opened and in came an unexpected visitor—daria, the mother of the girl who had hanged herself
you’re not at all like my alyosha—when he looks at me, his eyes beam
it’s a pretty tricky question!
i would been waiting for you these past three days, i suddenly heard myself blurting out
and he told her everything: how he had been sent to their father’s to get the money from him, how dmitry had broken into the house, how he had given his father a brutal beating, and how, after that, he had again reminded alyosha to go to see her—katerina—and give her his regards
why shouldn’t my servant be like one of the family?
smurov, walking beside him, kept looking back at the shouting group behind
the question is, then, whether this is because people are bad or because that is their nature
he started realizing his 'idea' by stealing money at a roulette table
allow me to explain the following point to you
'perhaps you know how to get that stone out of here?
it was just a joke
she’s an angel, katerina cried, her tone suddenly acquiring extraordinary warmth
all right, all right
but, in reality, she has no right to accuse my client of betraying her, because it was she who betrayed him!
the first time after the murder that he had seen and spoken to him was on the very day of his arrival
no, sir, she wouldn’t even let me look at it from a distance
and, it turned out, it affected me too
he could have bled to death, mother!
he's going off somewhere again, zverev said
so go now, and love ivan!
what if i say: even if he were there, hence nothing
mitya stood up, looking intently at his brother with a strange, wild, contorted smile
of course, nothing prevents a mystic or a fanatic from having red cheeks
it was too painful for me to see him in that state
as it turned out, my childhood friend lambert belonged to one of those gangs of small-time crooks that go in for what is defined as blackmail by the criminal code, which also specifies the appropriate penalties
alyosha believed that implicitly
at that moment, every woman among them had no doubt whatever that our prosecutor had been crushed so thoroughly that he would never recover
all sorts of extraordinary stories circulated about her passionate love for mitya, even after he had committed the crime
i’m surprised at you
in general, he was eccentric, even whimsical, although always pleasant and warm
your eyes look so peculiar
she was holding his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he was saying something in a very loud voice, without looking at her, to maximov, who sat across the table from him
so, while the episode with the former university student showed that my idea was capable of blurring the messages my brain received from my senses, the episode with the baby arina showed just the opposite—namely, that no idea could capture a man (at least me) so completely as to enable him to ignore something overwhelmingly moving and to prevent him from sacrificing to it the results of years of effort directed toward the realization of his idea
if i were the defender, i would have said straight out, he killed him but he is not guilty, and the hell with all the rest!
what peeves me most, in fact, is that by describing my own adventures with such emotion, i give the impression that i am still the same person as i was in those days
but tell me, isn’t there such a thing as legal action?
you’ll be here for many months and years yet
and, in general, i had stumbled upon these people at a very bad moment: i was vibrating with exuberance and joy while each of them was preoccupied with his own troubles, and very serious ones
ah, so it’s you, rakitin!
it's one of those awful, shameless patriotic tall tales!
why, what have i done?
i know how miserable he is about it now, and if he's stopped washing, it's out of sheer despair
children, as long as they are young, say seven years old, for instance, are very different from adults—entirely different creatures, totally unlike adults in their very essence
persons unknown to you
i shouted, no, you do not understand—you see, there was a certain manuscript
i cried, surprised beyond belief
what’s the matter, trifon?
he was sitting on a bench and writing something in a notebook with a pencil
you know, i always try to ignore all that, but there's something serious brewing today
the three-room cottage she lived in was rented furnished, and the furniture was of old, red mahogany in the unfashionable style of the ’s
i was basing myself on what dmitry had told me
you haven’t a kopek to your name
anyway, i have had enough of this!
i mean that if i’m still in town tomorrow (which is extremely unlikely, for i expect to leave today) and if we happen to meet, i don’t want to even mention any of these topics, not a word
and i want you to note that, during the two hours i had been playing before, the zero had never come up so that no one was even staking on it any more
it was hard to tell whether he was still fooling or was now really deeply moved
i agree that he was weak physically and that his health was poor
she had succeeded in convincing someone or other to let her into the courtroom again before the prosecutor and the defense counsel made their speeches
what do you think you’re doing?
i did not believe him at first
there was still enough daylight for them to see my pale face and trembling figure
here, mr karamazov, here’s your hat; let me get my own cap, and let us be on our way
i loved you because you are so generous
there she could scrub the floors, weed the vegetable garden, heat the bathhouse, while still keeping an eye on her baby and the other four children who ran around outside the buildings in their little shirts
the next day, at dawn, the general rode out to the hunt in full dress, surrounded by his obsequious neighbors, hounds, kennel attendants, huntsmen, every one of them on horseback
besides, you have no need of my forgiveness and i have no need of yours
and while i myself am perfectly lucid and reasonable, my double wants to do something incongruous, sometimes something extremely funny
i am a mother, you know, and i will
when they reached him, he was already writhing on the cellar floor at the foot of the steps, his body twisted by convulsions, his mouth frothing
trishatov had rushed for a doctor, but versilov came to before the doctor arrived
isn’t that so, von sohn?
of course, i was not intentionally eavesdropping on them, i simply could not prevent myself from listening when i saw how much the news of the arrival of that woman affected my mother
i feel drawn into the streets, into the blackness
all these friendly, nice faces that usually radiate love for me are now inaccessible and, if i become the tiniest bit too noisy, too playful, i know i will be ordered out of the room
just as suddenly, the old lieutenant colonel became very sick and was unable to leave the house for two days, so he couldn’t hand over the government funds
this is really something!
ivan said with a grin
i see nothing wrong with putting it that way, vasin said, still puzzled
just as he has created god, in that case
he asked in the same tone
however, although he had waited for kolya to act of his own accord, he had sent smurov to him a couple more times to ask whether he would not talk to alyosha after all
and now, gentlemen, i beg you to wait here a minute while i announce you
as to children leaving their parents to find their own nests, you could read about that in the bible
sit down, mitya, and tell me what you’ve been trying to say
a vicious woman like me needs to pray
well, perhaps there was nothing in him to inspire respect
he was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes when he was alone with another person, he would suddenly become talkative, effusive, and was liable to burst out laughing quite unaccountably
now kolya’s crazy act seemed to have improved dardanelov’s standing, and, because of his efforts on the boy’s behalf, he was made to understand that there might be some hope for him after all, although as yet a very remote hope
whenever that happened, he would leave her in the care of auntie tatyana prutkov, who would always turn up when he needed her
i’ll open all your letters and read them—i might as well warn you now
ivan continued in the same whisper, his mouth crooked with spite
that was two days ago
mitya’s grandfather, that is, adelaida’s father, mr miusov, was no longer alive; his widow, mitya’s grandmother, had moved to moscow and was in very poor health; and, in the meantime, adelaida’s sisters had married and moved away
ilyusha was so completely dumbfounded when he heard that that i thought perhaps i’d overdone it a bit
what does that word mean?
but, damn it, what the hell is there to make you so sure that you’ll have an epileptic fit just then?
ivan cried out in wide-eyed amazement, staring at smerdyakov as if in awe
just write that iou
he was unconscious and all covered with blood
forgive me, oh great elder—i made up that last bit about diderot’s being baptized as i was telling the story
then she started cleaning up the room
i felt i owed him no explanations or apologies, for i resented the fact that someone like ivan should suspect me of still being in love with that
that i can’t say, sir, but i think she’s gone to join some officer who sent for her from there
so, from now on, consider we don’t know each other—and this is for good
i don’t know yet
so i decided to wait for you here: you were bound to come this way, since there’s no other way to get to the monastery
who told you he would been dismissed?
he was about my height
this is no longer ultramontanism, this is arch-ultramontanism!
the six windows giving onto the street were brightly lighted
he was walking very fast, as though hurrying somewhere
everybody writes like that these days,  rakitin told me, because the environment demands it
why, old gregory used to carry me in his arms when i was little
we ate it, le grand dadais growled
he doesn’t seem to be in much of a state to discuss business right now
and this is what i was able to make out of his explanations
he even had moments of depression during which he threatened to resign his post and become a defense counsel
and while they’re at it, let them also bring up some brandy and red and white wine—just like that other time
he thought intently for a moment
as to my mysterious and constant visitor, i was filled with tremendous admiration for him, for, beyond being enthralled by his intellectual powers, i vaguely felt that he was nurturing certain plans within him and that he was preparing something very important
did he really want to shoot her at that moment?
is he all right?
well, you can go to hell then!
i will get her for you, from the entrails of the earth if i have to!
these eyes, themselves rather small and unexpressive, were set exceptionally close together, divided only by the very thin bone of his long, slender nose
so she walked up to the apartment and asked for the lady
that’s good enough, fine!
did you really come or did i just dream it up or invent it all in my imagination?
i remember only too well the sad and painful feeling that kept tugging at my heart during those hours at the table
alyosha muttered, crossing himself and drifting into peaceful sleep
where can you possibly have found such a tailor around here?
and on top of that, she had suddenly announced that she too had been to see smerdyakov!
but once they have paid this tribute, i say to them: you have asked for it, you bastards, so it serves you right
i certainly won’t ask him about back-scrubbers
just before i would come in, the doctor had given him a pretty thorough examination
you know how a schoolboy grills a new classmate
don’t keep telling me that
but wait a minute, perkhotin said in a worried tone, watching dmitry uneasily
you understand, pine’ and to pine’—although actually she said it somewhat differently—i’m a bit confused
he was about twenty-six, spare, blond, above average in height, with a serious and at the same time gentle look
for a whole month, i kept repeating it all over town
and he started peppering smerdyakov with the kind of questions the man had just complained about to ivan—all about the lady visitor he was waiting for—questions that we will omit here
and i will say this of servants too
it was completely dark now and peter came in with candles
now, one hour later, she threw herself at julia’s feet and kissed them
she's horrid, she's scheming, you must not trust her
avoid fear too, although fear is really only a consequence of lies
please let me in!
but you can already see those sunken cheeks and those wrinkles on her forehead, and that frightened, timid look—all these traits that have now been accentuated by the years and are growing even more pronounced as time goes by
i should have asked you for twenty-five rubles really
now he sat motionless and he did not notice when he dozed off; then he fell asleep as he sat there
tell me, if you know so much
i needed the money very badly, but my decision was final
i commented and could not help laughing
who sewed it in like that?
she looked at him in frightened perplexity, but after she took the flowers, color brightened her pale cheeks and joy gleamed in her eyes
see those two branches?
it contained crayon and watercolor sketches of temples on mountain sides, of cupids, of a lake with swans on it, and also some verses such as:
when he heard that, the priest changed the subject, though it might have been kinder of him to have imparted to dmitry his suspicion—namely, that if samsonov had recommended the man to him only as the hound, either he must have done so as a joke or there must be something wrong somewhere
my life is coming to an end—i know it, hear it
you see, what happened is that i got myself deep in debt, like an idiot, and all i want is to win enough money to pay back what i owe
they will raze churches and flood the earth with blood, but the stupid children will finally realize themselves that, although they are rebels, they are weak and are unable to bear their own rebellion
i would never have imagined any such outburst from her
and what about the beautiful katerina?
ah, if only juchka could be there too, as well as the puppy, then he would be really happy!
they only irritated her
but it suddenly occurs to me that i have never heard you talk yet
you pride yourself on your chosen ones, but you have only the chosen, while we will bring peace of mind to all men
as i said, i was in some sort of trance, in a strange state of elation, but before i could finish mrs prutkov suddenly seized me by the hair with a quickness i would never have suspected her capable of and violently jerked my head down
imagine that—he was sure!
yes, i did, alyosha said
and he walked on without giving them back the house
but what did i find in that cell?
the handkerchief was soaked with blood
so dmitry, my boy, shall i tell her not to worry, that you’ll be calm now?
i rushed away from the window and started running toward the garden fence
when he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal, in satisfying his vices
he marched in with his long stride, looking straight ahead of him, and sat down, looking completely detached
there were two pots of flowers on the window sill and, in a corner, many icons, one of them a large picture of the mother of god probably painted long before the schism
that's a mother's heart for you!
i didn’t understand her at all then: i thought she wouldn’t come with me unless i had some money, that she would never accept me penniless
let’s drink that bottle here
i suppose you are laughing at my appearance
but the prince did not enjoy the landlord's company; indeed, the man only annoyed and revolted him; and somehow the prince felt more and more suspicious of the fellow
ah, that was a terrible misunderstanding and i am awfully sorry for what happened, mr dolgoruky, my dear an
none of us— i mean the people like myself—had anything to show for his efforts
i’m maria, she said
still, i could not restrain myself when i heard a middle-aged officer sitting in front of me mumble to his neighbor:
your mother is the most perfect and the most delightful creature
later, he vaguely recollected several men tearing her from him by force and leading her away
ivan stood there dumbfounded
no, no, i’m not
or do not you know i am a doctor and a male midwife?
yes, and on top of that, deep down in my heart, i am also guilty of
to hell with the oysters, perkhotin snapped almost spitefully
ever since sergei's arrest, there had been in poor lisa's attitude a sort of proud challenge, an inaccessible haughtiness that was almost unbearable
as soon as we were in each other's arms, he began to weep
he certainly would remember, however, the inexpressible sensations he experienced during his contemplation
why, instead of going out to meet them in the passage, i hid myself, i cannot say; it just happened like that, without any planning or thinking whatever
how could you allow a stupid young pup to talk so disrespectfully about his mother?
no, lise, there’s no contempt for him, alyosha said firmly, as if he’d been expecting that question
the bells jingled and i was dozing
smerdyakov took the book about isaac the syrian off the money and put it aside
it won’t take me more than two minutes if you will only let me talk, and i’ll explain the whole plan i wanted to present to you
i became acutely conscious of my complicity in this affair if i did nothing, and my irritation grew
you took three hundred rubles from the prince today
i just looked intently into the faces of those around me and tried to guess what i needed to know
his face twitched slightly
i was about to once, but i couldn’t do it
i won’t go on if you don’t want me to
that's not honorable at all, my friend, especially since your mother has nothing to reproach herself for: she's a woman of the highest respectability and if she's not called mrs versilov to this day, it's only because she's still married to another man
but why, why, did you suspect me of such desires, then?
what i like about this, the visitor said, is that from the very start we’ve addressed each other with complete familiarity
ah, alyosha, you aren’t in love with me at all, not in the least!
he craved that renewal and regeneration
it was a fateful moment for me
yes, quite—is he a cavalryman then?
you saw it, did you?
i soon got bored and my ears became inured to the whispering; although i kept listening, i did so mechanically, sometimes forgetting that i was listening and not taking the words in
from pale, his face had turned red, almost purple, and every feature in it was quivering and twitching
didn’t you know that already?
he was still very annoyed with himself
without thinking i seized his hand, almost fervently (i often act impulsively like that and my room was almost completely dark)
i lived near the voznesensky bridge in a huge block of flats
she made the sign of the cross over him three times and saw him off to the door
i’m sure you disagree again, karamazov?
oh, you can bet on it, boy
there are some people like that, my friends, and there should be
his family had even announced in the newspapers that they would not be held responsible for his debts
right, right, let's drop it; in fact, i would be glad to forget the whole business if it were possible
anna, please give him some tea, il prend toujours par les sentiments!
there he increased the sum by borrowing three rubles from his landlord and his wife, who gave it to him gladly, although it was all they had, because they had such great affection for their lodger
indeed, it seemed the old man was anxious to tell his son something and he had come out into the living room especially to meet him
a girl may weigh the merits of her suitor, there's no crime in that
no, no, it is quite out of the question!
he had been thinking during the whole month that such an object could be used as a weapon, so he recognized and accepted it as such the very second he saw it!
during my wanderings i met my former orderly afanasy, in the provincial town of k i had not seen him for eight years
in fact, i too had had some dealings with him in the past month and, for certain reasons, i was rather surprised to see him walk in that day
is this really your conviction about what would happen if men lost their faith in the immortality of the soul?
then i said gott der heilige geist,  and he tried to repeat as much of it as he could, laughing all the time
just as i expected, i did not find out quite everything i wanted from you, i said
there were seven men and three women in a room that seemed rather small for ten people
or do you think we will be deceiving them?
nevertheless, she is all there, our old mother russia; we can smell her!
it’s doing this in front of the mothers that particularly arouses their senses
their only secret is their godlessness, and your inquisitor’s only secret is that he doesn’t believe in god, that’s all!
let me add that, in my opinion, writing in russian is more difficult than in any other european language
but now,  he says, with smerdyakov dead, who will believe your story when you tell it in court?
je parle comme une dame russe sur les eaux minerales, le grand dadais answered, still holding his neck stretched out
he was just a simple monk with no priestly rank
smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked at ivan through the glasses
what do you say, do you think he would?
he is not in love with katerina, alyosha said with assurance
i know, though, that in the end i’ll reconcile myself, complete my quadrillion too, and learn the secret
they don’t care about saving their souls
when she saw it, she flew to him impetuously, seized him by the hands, almost forced him to sit down on his cot, and sat down close by him, never letting go of his hands and pressing them spasmodically
i won’t answer it because the answer would dishonor me
but the way she tore into me!
my heart was sinking and when i tried to say something to the driver, the words would not come out right and sounded like incoherent mumbling
he said aloud in hysterical rapture
however, i must mention something essential: tatyana prutkov, my sincere and loving friend, keeps pestering me every day, insisting that i should now enter the university
we were interrupted by a footman who appeared in the doorway
she waited, watching me in silence
i’m so glad you’re here too, he said to him
vasin smiled and told me that he remembered it by heart anyway
gives the insects sensual lust
he seemed stunned and was breathing with difficulty
i told you that out of sheer kindness
damn it, can’t you search me like this?
so you knew very well where the envelope was hidden
but to get back to our subject, let me tell you that your mother does occasionally break her silence, but whenever she does express her opinion on something, it at once becomes obvious that it was a waste of time trying to enlighten her, even if you would spent five years explaining that particular point to her
well, that’s how it is, and after this, let it be according to god’s will
you can be sure that i will come back to you some day—in that sense, for me you are
you’re too stupid, really, too hopelessly stupid, ivan said cantankerously
the cowl was left open, but the face was covered by a black veil
the pretty boy trishatov, who until then had been silent and brooding, asked me, holding up his glass across the table
i also felt very curious, for i guessed that there was a secret weighing on him
ah, cher enfant, it was such a noble, such an honorable, gesture that even kilyan—that was the name of the scribe in the downstairs office—even he was completely flabbergasted!
i was silent, concentrated, attentive, and frightfully calculating; i was patient and stingy, although also resolute at critical moments
he’s her man, mr karamazov
hurry, go to the prison or it will be closed
but before reaching it, he stopped and said, looking at grushenka:
what have i done to you?
you certainly like to take your precautions!
he was a real father to me!
but he forgot her and married someone else
he said now in a quite different voice
are you angry with someone?
the old man was telling that cockeyed tale about me, but he knows nothing about this
of the world in grim travail,
now let me tell you this, i cried out, suddenly losing all patience
dr herzenstube comes to see him every day
why do not they come to me frankly and openly?
but, as you must know, the greater the power, the more frightening is the responsibility of wielding it!
even if i do not believe in the divine order of things, the sticky young leaves emerging from their buds in the spring are dear to my heart; so is the blue sky and so are some human beings, even though i often don’t know why i like them; i may still even admire an act of heroism with my whole heart, perhaps out of habit, although i may have long since stopped believing in heroism
he was very touched to see the almost tender concern all these recent enemies now showed for him
have you been at home with your family, and did you see your brother?
mitya lowered his eyes
i didn’t want you to go to moscow, mr ivan, because if you were in chermashnya, you wouldn’t be so far away
perhaps because the other fellow doesn’t smell right, or because he has a stupid face, or because once upon a time he may have stepped on his toe
this was something unprecedented, something absolutely astounding, even for a strong-willed, proud, and haughty person like her, for who could have expected such a complete confession and self-indictment!
i requested it most insistently
this is my answer: you may think you have heard all that before, but you have not heard a thing yet
and job, when he praises the lord, serves not only him but his whole creation, for generations and generations, forever and ever, for that is what he was foreordained to do
you see, i know very well he hates me, just as he hates everybody, including you, even though you have the impression that he thinks highly of you
in russia our poet tyuchev, believing deeply in the truth of his words, wrote:
i won’t let them, though
speak clearly, don’t hurry and, above all, don’t leave anything out
to that i can only reply that he now viewed grushenka’s past as non-existent
he seemed paralyzed with fear
perhaps ever since ivan had come to know katerina?
she’s still in her wheelchair, isn’t she?
and i would advise you too, alyosha, never to worry about these matters, least of all about god—whether he exists or not
at the same time, i will have to confess something that i am horribly ashamed of
a monk whispered into alyosha’s ear that rakitin had just arrived from town and wanted to see him
and all the money they stole from him—they didn’t give him receipts for it, so we’d never know how much it was
and why has he forgotten everything?
but what would happen if the enemy attacked us?
i suddenly announced with great emphasis
i don’t really have to go into all that, for i didn’t create the world, and i’m not responsible for it
no, that i could never bear—i’ll kill myself if he does that!
no, no, i do not want to hear what you have to say!
grushenka then felt sorry for her first love and in the evening went to pay the poles a visit
in the house, you know, where you were put to bed, well, they would not let him in  in fact, he was given a rather peculiar reception
i did it right in front of his eyes, and although he didn’t seem to believe me before, as soon as he heard the signal, he immediately ran to the door and opened it
that it was her perdition, my mother must have understood soon enough, although when she first went to him i doubt that she even gave it a thought
but you cannot apologize in the course of the duel, my second shouted at me angrily
and now she felt as if she had leaped into an abyss
better siberia than your love, katya, for i love another woman, and i know that you got to know her only too well today, so i don’t expect you can ever forgive us
but although he had not said much on that occasion, alyosha had seen and understood a good deal
as he started to answer, alyosha suddenly gave a start, as though he had just remembered and understood something
she had recurring fits of hysterics for days on end
but i don’t think there is any need for you to go into that any further, or any obligation for me to answer such questions, because it is all my private concern
but it’s so strange the way you can tell things in advance
it was as if the threads of all those innumerable worlds of god had met in his soul and his soul was vibrating from its contact with different worlds
the moon was shining brightly
that is really very hard to believe
it was probably to avoid such remarks and comments that father ferapont was allowed to do as he pleased
i should have put my foot down right away and i had not done it
here, kiss me now, i want you to
no german papa can muster such will power
i remember him apologizing and mentioning someone called anna
but while still in moscow, i had already decided to postpone the real beginning of my effort until i became completely independent
well, demidov brought it to him, as an honest man: there will be a search of my place tomorrow,  demidov told him
and he gave me a pretty good idea at the very start of what this purpose was
all right, my boy, i concede in advance the absurdity of it all, including the crying on his shoulder, which i told you about myself and which you are now using against me, thus taking undue advantage of my trustingness and confidence
and another voice said: no, don’t shout!
unfortunately, just at that moment, my mind was completely preoccupied with a stupid idea, and i just shrugged in disgust, got up, and left the table, letting him keep the ten rubles
miss anna is so sorry for prince sergei!
oh, if you want a piece of good advice, never allow a conceited, envious man to see a large sum of money in your hand!
they were completely engrossed in what they were doing
i only examined out of the corner of my eye her old, dark overcoat, her rough hands (almost the hands of a working woman), her heavy shoes, her face that had grown very thin, and the first wrinkles that had already appeared on her forehead
the useless worm will crawl on the earth for the last time, and disappear!
i’ll go and give that boy a good hiding!
prince, i request that you immediately pay me the fifty rubles you owe me for one month of my services, i blurted out all in one breath and with an irritation verging on rudeness
i almost threw my arms around vasin
anyway, seeing them only makes it worse
he leaped to his feet and shouted: it was smerdyakov who killed him, it was smerdyakov!
see, over there, sitting and waiting under that wooden gallery
if you need money, i can give you some, for you, you can always count on me
he was quickly led out amidst the laughter of the audience
alyosha was surprised, never having expected that this face could glow with such sincere warmth
first of all, let’s have some coffee!
in a different part of the town ivan had a very comfortable apartment in the wing of a house belonging to the well-to-do widow of a civil servant
she’s wrong about your being crazy, but she’s right that you’re not well, alyosha said
i mean, have you ever stolen someone else’s money straight out of his pocket or purse
and you say she went home from there?
that impression flashed like a red streak among the painful, sorrowful thoughts that were churning in alyosha’s head
his face suddenly became very grave and he declared that the baby must immediately be sent to a foundling home
the monks, although their expressions did not change, waited tensely to hear what the elder would say, and seemed ready to leap to their feet like miusov
oh, i understand why the simple people love you
a sudden change came over him: instead of the solemn, tragic look he had worn when he came in, his expression became that of a small child
do you recognize this object?
nothing would calm the old man now—he had reached the dangerous line of drunkenness beyond which some drinkers, peaceful until then, deliberately try to lose their tempers and to assert themselves
i only hope it won’t entail loss of civil rights, will it, mr prosecutor?
the story about the goose pleased him no end
that was long ago—five years or so
why are you blushing then?
but i swear i have no doubts about his gift of feeling anguish for europe's turmoils and in my eyes that capacity in itself is infinitely more important than any kind of practical competence put to use in such modern activities as, say, the construction of railroads
not to mention the fact that i still do not quite understand what you are actually reproaching me for
i will always have my idea at my side!
bandaged now, it’s all aflame
you see, i’ve wanted to tell you many things since i’ve been behind these leprous walls, but i felt i couldn’t bring up the most important thing; i felt the time hadn’t come yet
he did not give up his drinking bouts, but now she would watch over him during those days and try to cure him of this habit
this was particularly hard for gregory, who loved children and was not ashamed to show it
i won’t keep you long; in fact, i won’t bother to take my coat off
she too kept her coat on, a rather shabby one, on top of which she had tied an odd piece of material as a scarf, and on her head was something that looked like a rain hat, old and battered, which certainly did not help her looks any
i screamed, beside myself, glaring at everyone around me
and the counsel goes on to put straight the gospels and established religion as a whole
his shoulders were broad and one could guess that he was very tall; even though he was sick, pale, and emaciated, and his face was long and drawn, he still seemed quite strong and cheerful
and this is just such as case, he said, for the very first newspaper reports suggested something to me that was very much in favor of the accused
we have something
but after it, the sick man could have regained consciousness
i don’t want any lemonade, ivan said, and we’ll talk about me later
this time his features were no longer twisted and his clownish expression had vanished
it was not just that he did not believe me, she said, lowering her eyes and smiling strangely, but he decided that i had all the vices
nevertheless you still wish to keep one thousand for yourself?
but soon the surprised expression on his face changed to a smile which grew increasingly sarcastic
even if i did nothing in europe but roam around (and i knew that was all i was going to do), the fact that i carried with me my russian idea and my russian view of the world was a sufficient contribution in itself
this is something i know, if i know anything
mother was listening, tense with alarm
the little pole lighted his pipe again and prepared to deal
and try not to scare anna either, for i love her too and you are unfair to her because you ca not understand her; if she's embittered, it's because; she's been neglected since her early child hood
your bloodstained hands
hell, if i hadn’t pulled him off, i suppose he’d have killed him—how much more could the old fool take
i don’t expect it was to cut my throat secretly, or was it?
of course, i thanked him for the poem and he seemed very flattered
you must surely have heard of me?
what signals are you talking about?
rank, class, pride, sense of honor, and simple decency were all trampled in the mud; men and women were ready to sacrifice anything just to get hold of a few shares
so i rushed back upstairs and straight to afanasy’s tiny, partitioned-off room
and this happened by itself; it grew as i grew
but they never think to face the only truth, although life without god is nothing but torture
when he married miss fanariotov, he resigned his commission
i was sure you were after something or other
let me say first that i do not doubt for a moment that he loved my mother, although at one point he did desert her (unmarried her, as he put it)
oh, i knew she would say that—truthful, sincere, and honorable as she was!
lise cried, laughing nervously, her cheeks turning bright pink
now decide for yourselves, gentlemen of the jury—if smerdyakov were the murderer, would he have left the envelope lying on the floor when he left?
but i would known all the time that he must have been looking for those letters
gentlemen, he said, turning to the prosecutor and the examining magistrate, now i will open up my whole soul to you, so that we can finish it all in a second, and then we’ll all have a good laugh about that absurd suspicion
he’ll do anything you want, whatever you ask him to
you must know all that
the fresh air revived him somewhat
no, no, not in the least
and she would understand, then, that since this time i was bringing back half the sum she had entrusted to me, i would pay her back the rest too—i mean the money i squandered, even if it took me my whole lifetime to earn it or to raise it
as he was thinking of this, he put on his quilted winter jacket with its fur collar, strapped his schoolbag across his shoulder, and, despite his mother’s instructions that in this cold you must never go out without your overshoes, looked at them with scorn as he passed them by
someone visits him every day
ah misha, i was just going to kiss you for doing this errand for me
yes, people draw back because they are afraid, or perhaps because they are horrified and disgusted
well then, sometimes i reason like this: as soon as i die, the devils are sure to drag me down to their place with their hooks
actually she blushed often, always barely perceptibly, and this trait of hers endeared her to me even more
he had never harmed anyone, but people nevertheless somehow felt resentful and asked: why should this man be considered such a saint?
has anyone invited you to go to america with him?
but that was only until i saw today the fateful piece of evidence presented by miss katerina verkhovtsev
and, with all due respect, mademoiselle alphonsine is not a slut, just the contrary, and she came here not to see you but to pay a visit to my wife, with whom she is acquainted
and in the final scene when the guests were leaving and chatsky called for his carriage, the amazing way you shouted 'send me my carriage
oh no, you’ll just have to excuse me and hear me out
you mean—he proposed to her?
you’re a nice kid, you know
i want to see it, she said with an imploring smile
but that's just the way these defenseless creatures are—they may feel it's the end of them, but they still go ahead regardless
then one of the turks points his pistol at the baby, holding it four inches from the child’s face
all right, here’s some
perhaps i am being unfair to you, he said, still not sounding like himself
i would not have brought them up otherwise
he seemed calmer now
so you are my dream
i did not want to talk to the landlady
he looked as if he were at the end of his tether, completely spent, although he was still in a state of great agitation
alyosha decided that, as soon as he had time, he would try to discover the reason for the boy’s mysterious and puzzling resentment of him
ivan shouted, almost in a frenzy
and what about the defense?
i’ll risk another little ruble now, one more single little ruble, maximov muttered blissfully, delighted that he had already won one ruble
in that case, why did he have to go to anna's yesterday and tell her definitely that there could be nothing between them?
that’s right, here
i was talking about a higher order
and every time i had to set these busybodies straight by saying: no, just plain dolgoruky
his face was tense and expectant, but now he looked at ivan with servile timidity
i saw a little boy, so little in fact that i was surprised he was alone in the street at such an hour
my heart sank at once and i did not know what to do
why, lisa, ca not you credit me with a few ideas of my own?
and he handed her the little bunch of frozen flowers
but he shoved you with his hand and, on top of that, ordered his lackeys to drag you away while the lady was sitting in the carriage watching all that and laughing at you
he said and laughed again
alyosha caught kolya’s eye and started signaling to him vigorously, but kolya ignored him and looked elsewhere
but then he thought about it and understood it all: he was dangerously ill and his mother was asking him to fast and to confess and to take the sacrament while he still had some strength left in him
alyosha sat down on the bench where he had sat the day before, and waited
call dmitry here at once—i’ll get him for you if you’re willing—and when he gets here, allow him to take your hand and ivan’s and to join your hands together

but i don’t want any sacrifice from her!
ivan shouted angrily to the coachman
i know her by heart, he said irritatedly
that’s right, wrublewski agreed
i know i really should not have told you all this, that it would have been much more dignified for me just to get out of your life
i thought all that out while waiting for vasin in his room
later the prince and i sat arguing about that paper a whole day, and, although he objected vehemently to certain things i had done, he remained very satisfied with it, though i am not sure whether he finally did present it
and finally, most important of all, he knew now of the existence of a certain document, a secret letter, hidden away somewhere, which, if shown to the crazy old prince, would reveal to him that his own daughter considered him abnormal and had already discussed with her attorneys how to put him out to pasture
i would not avenge myself on anyone
ah hell, i suppose i’ll stand that too!
you want me to explain again?
grushenka was not kept long on the witness stand because she obviously had nothing particular to add to the available evidence
judging from everything you have said and also from other indications, i mumbled, getting a bit mixed up, you sent for me because you want something from me
the forester scratched himself and silently departed to his half of the hut

prince andrei, despite the quick driving and the sleepless night, felt himself still more animated than the day before as he pulled up to the palace

when he had calmed down a little, he explained to rostov that he lived with his mother, that if his mother saw him dying, she would not survive it
how could i bring myself to leave rodya?

liberalism is not a sin; it is a necessary part of the whole, which without it would fall apart or atrophy; liberalism has the same right to exist as the most well-mannered conservatism; what i am attacking is russian liberalism, and i repeat again that i attack it essentially because a russian liberal is not a russian liberal, but is a non-russian liberal
soon a woman in a red cap stuck herself out the door holding a hot pot of dumplings with both hands, and placed it in the midst of those ready to eat

some of our liberals, still not long ago, took this hatred of russia for all but a genuine love of the fatherland and boasted of seeing better than others what it should consist of; but by now they’ve become more candid, and have even begun to be ashamed of the words love of the fatherland,  have even banished and removed the very notion as harmful and worthless
what's that to me?

one does not have the heart to scold her, she's so pathetic, so pathetic!
sofya semyonovna is not at home
however, the reason i maintain that, the prince suddenly picked up, obviously wishing to correct himself, is because people back then (i swear to you, it has always struck me) were not at all the same sort of people as we are now, not the same breed as now, in our time, really, like a different species … at that time people were somehow of one idea, while now they’re more nervous, more developed, sensitive, somehow of two or three ideas at once … today’s man is broader—and, i swear, that’s what keeps him from being such a monolithic man as in those times … i … i said it solely with that in mind, and not …

prince andrei was silent, but the princess noticed the ironic and scornful expression that appeared on his face
but my coughing went on and did not let up for about three more minutes
while listening to the whisper and feeling this stretching edifice of needles being raised, prince andrei had glimpses of the red circle of light around the candle and heard the rustling of cockroaches and of the fly striking against the pillow and his face
besides, i might have been mistaken
you, too, if you please, young man

the other day at the apraksins' i heard a lady ask: 'c'est ça le fameux prince andré?
captain, she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking russian confidently, though with a strong german accent, and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth i am telling, mr

in response to lauriston's proposal of peace, he replied that there could be no peace, because such was the will of the people; he alone, during the french retreat, said that all our maneuvers are unnecessary, that everything was getting done by itself, better than we could wish, that the enemy should be given a golden bridge, that the battles of tarutino, vyazma, and krasnoe were unnecessary, that they had to have some men left when they got to the border, that he would not give up one russian even for ten frenchmen
—but i refrained from asking questions out of pride

i read it myself and we both laughed: some russian mme
but he wants, then, to draw down on that head the punishment reserved for the damned!
natasha sat down with sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting prince andrei to join her
she's walking through the church with her eyes closed, constantly spreading her arms as if wishing to catch someone
a last explanation: i am by no means dying because i cannot endure these three weeks; oh, i would have strength enough, and if i wanted to, i could be sufficiently comforted by the very consciousness of the offense done to me; but i am not a french poet and do not want such comforting

what did he say?
i decidedly refused: i have daughters

these senseless nights, and such uninteresting, unremarkable days!
great vast lakes lie between the mountains
she would not let go of her mother, struggled with her gently, called for pillows, water, unbuttoned and tore open her mother's dress

iii: the audience well, then, captain, said porthos, beside himself, the truth is that we were six against six, but we were set upon treacherously, and before we had time to draw our swords, two of us had fallen dead, and athos, grievously wounded, was hardly worth more

the impression princess marya made on rostov was very pleasant
this morning the spanish deputies came to me, and i got into the carriage together with them
i do not mock you!

it was mutually and amicably agreed between totsky and the general that for the time being they would avoid any formal and irrevocable steps
it made for such losses!
i wo not describe the rest of that night, the fuss, and then the official visits; till dawn i literally shivered and considered it my duty not to go to bed, though, anyhow, i did not do anything

pierre again assumed the symmetrically naïve pose of an egyptian statue, evidently regretting that his clumsy and fat body took up so much space, and applying all his inner forces to making himself seem as small as possible
