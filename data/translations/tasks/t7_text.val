he sat down again and began glancing around in silence; everyone regarded him in perplexity
without saying a word, he turned and headed back in the direction of the haymarket
only then did you calm down; you clutched that junk in your hands day and night; it was impossible to get them away from you
arkady coolly removed his things from the carriage and climbed in next to bazarov
he may eventually become a proper rascal in time, when that nonsense has vanished, but now he’s too eager to live!
i’m talking about justice
one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again
later he recalled that he had started laughing with a nervous, shallow, inaudible, long-lasting laugh, and kept laughing all the while he was crossing the square
everything described here took place almost in a single moment
do you remember how mr razumikhin began letting the cat out of the bag?
we acutely sense in various aspects of his language varying degrees of the presence of the author and of his most recent semantic instantiation
he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase
reprinted by permission of the president and fellows of harvard college
he began, taking from the bundle a rather nice but at the same time very ordinary and inexpensive service cap
i agree that it’s an illness, just like everything else that’s in excess—and it’s essential that it go to excess—but, in the first place, it’s different for everyone, and in the second place, of course, one must maintain moderation, judiciousness, even if it’s base, but what’s to be done?
and he, he—also unseeing and unbelieving—he, too, would hear at once, and he, too, would believe
razumikhin stood there in front of him, dropping his arms, in dark and serious thought
baden-baden, december ,  ( january , )
at that moment, something seemed to pierce his heart; he shuddered and quickly moved away from the window
so, keep this in mind; and now be so kind as to accept, in the interests of your relative, in the first instance, this modest sum from me personally
cried razumikhin with some unusual agitation
svidrigaylov occupied two rather spacious furnished rooms
i will answer point by point
naturally, i considered it an honor to fulfill her request; i tried to pretend to be astounded and embarrassed; in a word, i played my part very well
over here, he replied
you can tell him i insulted all anglomaniacs
katya adored nature, and arkady loved it, although he did not dare admit it; odintseva was fairly indifferent to nature, as was bazarov (viii,  [p ])
she screamed, but the quartermaster, who had lost his balance from the swing, fell clumsily under the table
she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances, so as not to lose her strength
so it is, so it is: i haven’t even removed the loop under my arm!
relates to external cynicism
why have you embraced virtue so wholeheartedly?
and why did lieutenant porokh interrogate me after i fainted?
he also took his cap
i wasn’t that hungry
judging by his voice, he must be very young, raskolnikov reflected suddenly
meanwhile, he still hurried to svidrigaylov’s; did he expect something new from him, a sign or a way out?
suddenly he noticed a cord around her neck; he pulled it, but the cord was strong and didn’t break; besides, it was soaked in blood
he sez, he vil make big satire on me und vil in all ze papers write on me
arkady said in some annoyance
she asked, after waiting a minute
they’re in debt for that apartment; i hear that the landlady just served them notice, but katerina ivanovna says that she herself doesn’t want to stay there a moment longer
this question leads to the following doubt: is not bazarov pretending to himself and to others?
often, sometimes after several days or even weeks of gloomy, morose silence and silent tears, the sick woman became hysterically agitated and suddenly began talking aloud, almost without pausing, about her son, her hopes for him, about his future
how to proceed, ma’am?
¶ court council of war (german)
this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna, or simply lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that very same old woman, alyona ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender, where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test
but why shouldn’t i brag if it’s harmless?
there are no foundations to our society, dostoevsky wrote in his notebook in
oh, i don’t know!
arkady lowered his eyes
what difference does that make?
then he himself hurriedly left the room
as a result of their discomfort, the women sometimes pulled their hands away from the bony grip of his enormous hands
it seemed to raskolnikov that the head clerk had become ruder and more contemptuous of him after his confession, but strange to say—he suddenly felt that no one else’s opinion mattered to him at all, and this change seemed to take place in one single instant
he repeated, thinking in earnest that he had gone mad
all traces have been buried!
i have no sins!
just came to, echoed the stranger again, with a slight smile
they walk with a heavy step, supporting each other; when they approach the railing, they fall on their knees and remain there for a long time, weeping bitterly, gazing attentively at the headstone under which their son lies buried: they exchange a few words, brush the dust off the stone, move a branch of the pine tree, and pray once again; they ca not forsake this place where they seem to feel closer to their son, to their memories of him  can it really be that their prayers and tears are futile?
i’ll take this carriage to yelagin island
she was young and not unattractive—one of the group of women
three silver rubles or two little paper bills,  as that
of course, we’ll have dinner together
do you go often?
if i’d had even a drop of suspicion about you, that’s how i should’ve behaved
you have made me absolutely happy, he said, still smiling broadly
around her long, thin neck, resembling a chicken leg, was draped some sort of flannel rag, and over her shoulders, in spite of the heat, a worn-out, faded fur-trimmed jacket hung loosely
he was lionized by many people, indulged himself, even played the fool, and put on airs; but this too suited him
he’s not sarcastic, not because he lacks wit: it’s just that he has no time for such nonsense
on the contrary, i’m completely well!
the romanticism associated with the image of the youthful revolutionary, and the pedocracy to which it probably gave rise, had something inherently spurious and silly about it
the entrance to their staircase was from the street
by regarding bazarov detachedly as is possible only for a man who is behind the times and not involved in the contemporary movement of ideas; by examining him with the cold, probing gaze which is only engendered by long experience of life, turgenev has justified his hero and valued him at his true worth
everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich, who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg
incidentally, he was remarkably handsome, with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair; he was taller than average, slender, and well built
he too, however, spoke of bazarov as towering over the other characters, and declared that turgenev might claim to be drawn to him by an irresistible attraction, but it would be truer to say that he feared him
and yet i didn’t want to leave it
one of the caretakers asked
zosimov ordered that raskolnikov not be disturbed until he awoke

i’ve come to see you for the last time, raskolnikov continued gloomily, even though this was only his first visit
now what do we do?
here’s what i forgot!
they sat side by side, miserable and dazed, as if they had been cast upon a deserted shore after a storm at sea
luzhin said you were even the cause of a young child’s death
[vasily ivanovich nodded his head]
enlighten me with the latest principles
i would sometimes feel so sorry for him!
to pursue a career other than the one their background would normally indicate
what do you care about this stupid triumph over me?
yes, sir, you had a little attack, sir!
he finally establishes himself in an environment where he can live out the traditional forms of the aristocratic life he so treasures
then you should know that i love you, stupidly, madly  now see what you have extracted
may the kingdom of heaven be hers and—enough, old woman, it’s time to rest!
the lodgers were bawling, each doing his own thing—some were discussing, as best they could, what had just occurred; others were quarreling and cursing; still others struck up a song
whenever he encountered them, he always pressed up against his father and trembled
not officially and not me personally, but we were here, sir
can it be that her whole being is concentrated in her brain?
truth alone matters: what cannot be established by observation and experiment is useless or harmful ballast—'romantic rubbish'—
do you believe that i’d fallen in love to such an extent that had she said to me: cut marfa petrovna’s throat or poison her and marry me—it would’ve been done at once!
they began to buy real cream, do you hear?
never, never did i realize this more clearly than i do now; and more than ever do i fail to understand the nature of my crime!
but somehow he still understood some of them; he looked at him quizzically and didn’t know how it would end
her ample white dress hid her completely beneath its gentle folds; her legs were crossed, and the ends of her feet could hardly be seen
wait, where are you going?
he said, leaning over her
i shall try to avoid that
pray for me sometime, too: and thy servant, rodion
in the scene that describes bazarov's death, turgenev's hero falls into delirium, and is possessed by a vision of dogs; he describes this vision to his father: even now i am not quite sure i am expressing myself clearly
that’s what scared him that day at the police office when he fainted
well, go on, speak
he walked for a long time down the long, narrow corridor without finding anyone; he was about to shout when suddenly, in a dark corner, between an old wardrobe and the door, he discerned some strange object, something that seemed alive
i’m in a hurry, i have no time, and i have to leave soon
these passages—like the whole account of bazarov's death—are startling in their elemental power; they are also puzzling: turgenev uses the hero's delirium to represent his dying, in images that both arrest and confound the reader
dunya exclaimed in horror
an amusing old man and very kind, bazarov added as soon as vasily ivanovich had left
but can such minor matters really be inflated by so sonorous a name?
but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms, since theirs served as the passageway
yes, i hate them, i physically hate them
my regards to rodion romanych
sit down, he said suddenly, but in an altered, soft, and polite voice
who among our writers and scholars has not begun with some bizarre first steps?
but you can’t even write properly; the pen’s slipping out of your hand, observed the head clerk, staring at raskolnikov with curiosity
it flew open with a loud noise  he had not expected it to move so easily; besides, his hands were trembling
can it really be that love, sacred, devoted love is not all-powerful?
mumbled raskolnikov, in a barely audible voice
why do i need a whole procession?
i’ve come to see you for two reasons: first, for some time i’ve heard extremely interesting and favorable reports of you, and i wanted to make your acquaintance; second, i hope that perhaps you won’t refuse to assist me in an undertaking that directly concerns the interests of your sister, avdotya romanovna
arkady moved aside, but continued watching her; he did not take his eyes off her all during the quadrille
do you know what?
you’re being foolish, too, sonya: what do we have to eat now, tell me!
these last words were uttered in the entrance hall
it was aleksey semyonovich; he also works in our office
have you read it?
no, the document didn’t constrain me, svidrigaylov continued pensively
i’ll give you some for the journey
no, not at all, it’s even ridiculous in a certain sense
i was sea-bathing in ventnor, a small town on the isle of wight—it was in august of —when i first thought of fathers and sons, that tale thanks to which i lost—
the antiquated man stood there without moving for a few minutes and then slowly made his way home
i know one thing: there was no preconceived idea, no tendentiousness in me then
but what if he had wanted to or it had been part of his plans?
all of a sudden, razumikhin shuddered
similarly, i must deprive myself of the honor of meeting you tomorrow morning, as a result of unavoidable business at the senate, and so as not to interfere with your intimate reunion with your son, and avdotya romanovna’s reunion with her brother
the old nag stretches out her muzzle, gasps for breath, and dies
well, and the chill that ran down your spine?
she whispered rapidly, energetically, quickly glancing at him with her sparkling eyes and firmly grasping his hand in her own
sit down; stay here, begged svidrigaylov
they looked at each other still more fixedly
sonya took a step back from him in fear, as if from a madman
your father plays the cello?
let's see what species of mammalia this person belongs to, bazarov said to arkady the next day as they both climbed the stairs of the hotel where odintsova was staying
the proverbial words that bazarov omits, which arkady refuses to acknowledge, are demonic: devils lurk in still waters [v tikhom omute, cherty vodiatsia]
if sofiya semyonovna doesn’t return in ten minutes, i’ll send her to see you, if you like, even later today
that’s the simplest solution to the problem!

he promised to call in sometime after ten
hegel maintains that at this level any given phenomenon necessarily implies its opposite: complementary abstractions depend on each other for either of them to lay any claim to validity
good-bye, or, rather, till we meet!
i assure you, you won’t be sorry!
if only she’d tell us where to take her, otherwise
pavel petrovich opened his eyes slowly
but he also recalled that there were moments, hours, and even, perhaps, days full of apathy that overwhelmed him, as if in opposition to his previous fear—apathy resembling the painfully indifferent condition of certain people on the edge of death
during the course of the novel arkady learns to appreciate katya's qualities; although initially dazzled by odintsova, he turns to katya first for consolation when her older sister rebuffs him in favor of bazarov; but later arkady comes to love katya and submit to her mode of temporality
lay me back down
perhaps i’ll come here
she jumped back in fright, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak; she stared at him, her eyes open wide
-; and clark butler, g w f hegel (boston, ), pp
he never takes an interest in what interests other people at any given moment

peter ran off; while he went to fetch the droshky, the two opponents sat on the ground in silence
hey, enough of that, said svidrigaylov, suddenly recovering, i’ve told you
why didn’t you come to work with mitrei the next day?
if you like, with pleasure  i will have to ask nikolai petrovich about
as i have tried to show here, however, the hegelian dialectic has no less relevance for the novel
raskolnikov’s pale face flushed; he seemed to shudder all over; his eyes flashed
¶ a reference to a character in the play the marriage () by nikolai gogol
there were two soup spoons, two bowls, and complete settings: a saltcellar, pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so on, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in quite some time
even afterward, subsequently, when she recalled this moment, she felt strange and full of wonder: why was it that she realized immediately at that time that there was no doubt?
that's the one thing i have changed
by the way, mama, i committed an unforgivable act yesterday; i must have been out of my mind
his serious concerns are positive
seldom has a writer given a better cue to the meaning of his work, and most of all in the comparison between bazarov and pugatchev, the leader of an th century peasant rebellion who was hanged by a tzar
enough of that, arkady repeated after katya
you’re caught at last!
raskolnikov stood still for a long time and watched him go
the lodger opened his eyes, shuddered, and recognized nastasya
frightened, i ran away, and just then i heard the bell announce the train
bazarov would not steal a handkerchief for the same reason that he would not eat a piece of putrid beef
he begged her pitifully
svidrigaylov had arranged for a requiem to be sung punctually twice a day
in the first place, it’s impossible to say it here on the street; secondly, you must also hear what sofiya semyonovna has to say; in the third place, i have some documents to show you
literature has acquired a more mature outlook, and many harmful prejudices have been rooted out and ridiculed

i do not know you well, replied bazarov
he was here, but he’s vanished!

toggenburg and all the minnesingers, that is, it deals with the romantic ideal of love as something transcendent, extraordinary, fatal, mysterious, poetic, and infinitely distant from ordinary life
i’ve told you already, i did, i told you
were you also a cardsharp?
pavel petrovich walked to the end of the garden, also grew thoughtful, and also raised his gaze to the sky
it should be only one of us
what do you care about that?
we’ve gone further in our convictions
is not it true, bazarov, he's a sybarite?
she pointed at someone in the crowd
why do you say that?
for no one is so much the ideologue of the romantic and the aesthetic as pavel
entering the courtyard, she turned right, toward the corner where a staircase led up to her apartment
i have heard that countess lambert is dissatisfied with the novel: do not believe it
fenechka asked, taking the heavily bound volume into her hands
but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance, so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first, as if with annoyance, but then it grew stronger and stronger
turgenev is a master of language; he is interested in words in a way that the other great nineteenth-century russian novelists—with the exception of gogol— are not
at last they began to fear pulkheriya aleksandrovna’s strange silence on several points
they hire unreliable people to change banknotes in offices: can you trust perfect strangers with a job like that?

he added with a laugh
put some money away for a rainy day?
why isn’t zametov there?
the term, with due allowance for the changes of a century and of cultures, points to two fundamental aspects of bazarov that underlie both his attractive and repulsive traits for most readers—his immaturity and his position as an outsider in a world he never made

raskolnikov was silent and stared fixedly and decisively at porfiry
for a long time he tried to grasp one but he couldn’t; he was growing tired of his efforts
in what way does he (or she) differ from that other contemporary reader?
but faith in the people seems just as irrational to bazarov as the rest of the 'romantic rubbish
linked to the defeminization of appearance was the unconscious longing to resemble the man, for the distinctive garb of the nihilist girl—short hair, cigarettes, plain garments—were boyish affectations
this is the same as yesterday, cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna bitterly
he was almost beginning to rave; an anxious smile wandered across his lips
a dirty mutt, trembling from the cold, ran across the road in front of him

it wasn’t so much that he understood, but that he clearly felt, with all the strength of his feeling, that not only with his previous sentimental expansiveness, but even with whatever resources he had available, he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the police office, even if instead of their being just police officers, they were all his own brothers and sisters, even then he would have had no reason to communicate with them, not for anything in his life

with trembling hands, pulkheriya aleksandrovna handed him the letter
you seem to have forgotten my sister is both beautiful and clever, and  you in particular, arkady nikolaevich, should not say such things, especially with such a serious expression
why are you here?
give it to me!
he accused herzen and ogaryov of slavophilism in their thinking about the supposed revolutionary potential of the peasantry
the lament of poor, consumptive, bereaved katerina ivanovna seemed to produce a strong effect on the public

by contrast, turgenev sees communities, large and small, as a threat to an always precarious individuality and sense of identity
he’s a former house serf
and how do i know?
i’m all mixed up; that was then!
if i differ from lowe, it is in seeing this plot not as another endorsement of romantic love, but as quite the opposite
the rude expression of this irony, and a causeless and purposeless harshness in the treatment of others relates to external cynicism
i, too, don’t know how to thank him, continued raskolnikov, suddenly frowning and lowering his head
'what are you complaining about, what are you seeking, what do you ask of life?
it is the lucidity of final self-confrontation, bazarov's lament over his lost, his unused powers: i was needed by russia  no, it's clear, i was not needed  and: i said i should rebel  i rebel, i rebel!
go back to them and stay with them
oh, lord, did he really spend it all on drink?
he was not bored with her, and she offered to repeat yesterday's performance of the sonata; but when at last odintsova returned and he saw her, his heart instantly felt a pang  she was coming through the garden at a somewhat tired pace; her cheeks were red, her eyes shining brighter than usual under her round straw hat
she must have hidden here and not slept the whole night
the second is that of the raznochintsy, literally persons of various classes, a term applied to those members of classes other than the gentry, usually the clergy or the minor and provincial professional and bureaucratic classes, who sought  from ralph e matlaw, turgenev's novels, harvard slavic studies iv ()

bowing politely to his former traveling companion, he cried, let's go!
it's not for nothing i have always said you were the kindest, smartest man in the whole world; now i see you are as reasonable as you are magnanimous
you don’t believe in god!
i found ’em in the street, and he says this with some uncertainty, without looking at me
she rushed to him and embraced him tightly once more
ilya petrovich replied strangely
yet they couldn’t find general kobelev for someone who was looking for him
he looked around at the worn yellowish wallpaper, at the dust, his couch
it doesn’t mean a thing!
her head was spinning
i didn’t say that; but perhaps you’re also right about that; however
katya made a slight curtsey, took up a position next to her sister, and began sorting the flowers
then he listened again for sounds on the staircase, listening attentively, for a long time
in addition, i can recommend ganot, traité élémentaire de physique expérimentale
that is why bazarov is easily excited, why everything vexes him, everything has an effect on him, despite all his firmness and consistency in words and actions
he recalled his late wife  she did not live to see it!
persecution from the government reached a climax in  when the book version appeared
she stood in the same place, three paces away from the table
you are a proponent of the do- mostroi
and it all works out
muttered raskolnikov at last, not even comprehending the question very well
petr petrovich grew angry
who’s that curly-haired fellow who just looked in here?
somewhere down below, in the depths, visible just beneath his feet, he seemed to see all of his recent past, his previous thoughts, previous problems, previous subjects, previous impressions, this entire panorama, even himself, and everything else, everything
he said with utmost clarity, with the most offensive precision, that the reason for all of it was his miserable condition, his poverty and helplessness, his desire to provide for the first steps in his life’s work with the help, at least, of the three thousand rubles he had counted on finding at the old woman’s apartment
gradually she grew used to him, but was still timid in his presence, when suddenly her mother, arina, died from cholera
i’d have replaced the rock and put it back the same way as it was before, pressed it down with my foot, and then gone away
the creation of such figures as bazarov's mother and father is a real triumph of talent

(the force of the juxtaposition is vitiated in translation; in the original, fathers is the last word of stanza  and child is the first word of stanza )
it means that i was bored to death with all of you and want to be alone, raskolnikov replied calmly
he repeated, involuntarily enjoying an awareness of his own maturity and freedom
i’ll be even worse!
painstakingly surrounded by flourishes
he was on the same bed, wrapped up as before in the same blanket; the candle was not lit; full daylight was showing through the window
you ought to consult an experienced doctor, and not that chubby fellow you see!
some clerks were sitting and writing in the second room, dressed only a little bit better than he was, and they were all strange-looking
but his heart didn’t stop

the fact is that the events are not particularly entertaining and that the idea is not startlingly true

they consider raphael a fool because, they say, he's an authority; and they themselves are disgustingly impotent and sterile; their imagination goes no further than girl at the fountain no matter how hard they try!
i thought about that, too
such criticism has long ceased to have any intrinsic value, yet it serves well to define the heavy weight of tradition still bearing down on much of turgenev criticism and scholarship, particularly in the west
replies vehemently to pavel pe-trovich's tirades and does not immediately succeed in gaining control over himself and once more shutting himself up in his derisive coldness
he can say that even though his teeth are still chattering, he-he!
you,  she says, seem bored
for this reason alone rodion was right to drive petr petrovich away earlier!
he shuddered, came to, raised his head, looked out the window, guessed the time, and jumped up, having come to his senses completely, as if someone had torn him away from the sofa
yes, said nikolai petrovich through his teeth
for some reason, raskolnikov didn’t like that at all; he regarded the new paper with hostility, as if regretting that anything had changed
this is your uncle, she repeated, almost whispering
but it was not the trembling of youthful timidity or the sweet fretting over a first declaration of love that overcame him: it was passion struggling within him—powerful and painful—

he’s a practical man, hardworking, honest, and capable of loving deeply
look, look: they must be very hungry, the poor fellows!
she was twisting the thin stem of a wildflower in her fingers, her light shawl had slipped down to her elbows, and the broad gray ribbons of her hat were clinging to her chest

what are you talking about?
perhaps he’d even come like that on purpose, to show that he wasn’t afraid of anyone

when mama was coming up the stairs, she even crossed herself out of fear
but no one can keep the upper hand with her for very long, katya added in a low voice
but the left was not unanimous
meanwhile, at the stroke of midnight, svidrigaylov crossed the tuchkov bridge in the direction of the petersburg side

arkady noticed all this, but kept his opinions to himself
nikolai petrovich exclaimed in despair more than once
they told me so

therefore, she must mean something to him!
if someone has a conscience, and if he acknowledges his mistake, then let him suffer
turgenev describes the older kirsanov walking in his garden: 'nikolai petrovich  sorel declares that this passage occurs in a letter which, according to the economist lujo brentano, marx wrote to one of his english friends, professor beesly (réflexions sur la violence, th edn, paris, , p , n )
because she’s gullible and kind; she’s so kind that she believes everything, and
what did you say
does it still haunt you?
i’ll call in at your place one of these days
well then, tell me now, after such a beginning, how could i not be carried away by what followed?
at last tanyusha came in and announced that dinner was served
according to his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward, depending on the individual; then they pass away, as does any illness
aren’t you washing away half your crime by going to accept your suffering?
saying this, she hastened to throw on her cape and put on her hat while dunechka also got dressed
my young artist would have said to his contemporaries of his work: this, my friends, is what a fully developed man must be like!
he listened with pleasure and even felt very much like laughing, and laughing, and laughing
my brother's a man of the old school, hot-tempered and stubborn  thank god it ended the way it did
marmeladov, who didn’t pay any attention to these people, continued his story
he was a very young man, about twenty-two, with a dark complexion and a lively countenance, seemingly older than his years, dressed fashionably like a dandy, his hair parted to the back of his head, well combed and well greased, with a large number of different rings on his white fingers scrubbed clean with a brush, and wearing gold chains on his vest
i suppose they are waiting for me?
you live such an isolated life that you don’t even know things that concern you directly
when, six days later, i brought my first wages home—twenty-three rubles and forty kopecks—when i brought it all home, she called me a sweetie: you’re such a sweetie,  she said!
perhaps, in so doing, he may have contributed unwittingly to the fostering of that 'spiritual pedocracy', as sergey bulgakov called it, which became 'the greatest evil of our society as well as a symptom of intelligentsia heroism
you should pull yourself together
how is it that somehow i wound up at razumikhin’s place?
i don’t know what!
then it began to pour down rain; dunya, insulted and disgraced, had to make the trip, all eleven miles, with a peasant in an open cart
what would’ve happened to us now, dunya, without those three thousand rubles?
is it progressive or reactionary?
a page or two of condillac that very morning; but his methods were different, more up-to-date
drink some beer, more beer!
my purpose will be to suggest the further point that turgenev may be perceived not only as an artist, but in his artistry, as a certain kind of thinker
yes, sir, it’s simpler and understand—
stop it, enough of that; oh, how painful all of this is for me
what business is that of yours?
he even shuddered, since his nerves had been so frayed of late
he stopped in front of her
that entire episode with katerina ivanovna occurred because of sonya
raskolnikov was listening carefully
bazarov cried unwittingly, as he lowered pavel petrovich onto the grass
well, arkady nikolaevich, i see you understand love like all our modern young men: 'here chick, chick!
of course, in my personal opinion, you’re exaggerating the risks, but
in the prison rodion raskolnikov, a second-class convict, has been confined for nine months
let us add in parentheses that to maintain all this is the only way to preserve one’s beauty even in old age
i don’t want you ever to come back!
don’t be upset; i’m not a bore; i got on with cardsharps, i didn’t bore prince svirbey, my distant relative and grandee, i was able to write in mrs prilukova’s album about raphael’s painting of the madonna, i spent seven years with marfa petrovna without leaving the country, i spent nights in vyazemsky’s lodging house on haymarket square in the old days, and perhaps i’ll go up in berg’s hot-air balloon
in that sense, really all of us behave almost in a deranged manner, and extremely frequently, with only the slight difference that the sick’ ones are somewhat more deranged than the rest of us, and therefore it’s essential to draw a distinction
for the most part the friends visit together, in the kirsanov family, in the bazarov family, in the provincial capital, in the village of the widow odintsov
(he stood and picked up his hat)
i have forgiven thee once
put him right on the sofa, with his head over here, raskolnikov said
you’ll come here again?
many of our students have been to see her
he gradually contradicted his patient and, just imagine, they say he achieved results!
yes, said nikolai petrovich
he was becoming extremely absentminded and forgetful, and he knew that himself
this way, this way, to my place!
i heard it myself
anna sergeevna continued farther down the path, her beautiful dress rustling lightly
razumikhin will be with you; i told him
raskolnikov cried in a frenzy
that’s not the point, raskolnikov interrupted with disgust
she came in again at two o’clock with some soup
in a flash, a pillow turned up under the unfortunate man’s head, something no one else had thought of
sonya and polechka ran after her
finally he felt the return of his recent fever and chills, and surmised with pleasure that he could also lie down on the sofa
cried dunechka in a genuine frenzy, completely losing her head
he scalds himself on boiling milk and then tries to cool down someone else's hot water
zosimov struggled and then, after being released, looked closely at razumikhin and suddenly burst out laughing
he trembled with rage
the authorial consciousness, that overarching mind that gives the narrative its form, is touched by a knowledge more bitter than that possessed by either kirsanov or the elder bazarov: the vision of emptiness  or formlessness beyond the barriers of decorum does not belong to them
they say that tsars also visit the dying
but his face was as pale as before
she looked at her with suffering:
dunya looked at her brother with distrustful astonishment
yet it is impossible to reach the rich levels of these and other works without bearing in mind the seriousness for turgenev of his injunction that the artist's task is  understanding in imagery and the representation of what exists, and not theories about the future, not sermons, not propaganda
what a terrible, shocking speech, is not it?
now i remember, said raskolnikov, after some minutes of sullen reflection
and you, my friend, have you come to?
but why should i care about her?
do not worry, i will be careful
perhaps that’s all right; it’s the role of a sick man
dunya blushed fully, then suddenly became anxious:
clearly, they were eager to provoke the two of them
the rain still hadn’t ended
shouted the little boy from the chair
i can’t bear listening to it rustle
where’s the raising of lazarus?† find it for me, sonya
may , completely gray, stout, and somewhat stooped; he's waiting for his son, who just received his candidate's degree, as he himself had some time before
wer für die besten seiner zeit gelebt— der hat gelebt für alle zeiten
he even wondered whether he might be mistaken
what do you think?
the same set of values forms the background at the bazarovs's: when arkady and evgeny talk on the haystack about ultimate questions, they are interrupted by bazarov's father, who more than anyone (except, perhaps his wife) represents a devotion to home, to family, and to immediate neighbors, especially the peasants, whom he treats as part of his family
i do not understand you
one vision flashed before him along the way, but he was not surprised by it; he’d had a premonition that all this must be so
all of this occurred last evening
like speransky,  he added, pursing his lips after a brief silence
to beg for her tears once again?
she greeted svidrigaylov silently and politely, glanced at his soaking wet clothes with astonishment, but didn’t say a word
a man must be fierce, says a splendid spanish proverb
they spit in my face quite openly!
and, in the third place, because i proposed to observe all possible fairness in the execution, weights and measures, and arithmetic: out of all the lice on earth, i picked the least useful and, after killing her, proposed to take from her exactly as much as i needed for the first step, no more, no less (and the remainder, it goes without saying, would go to a monastery, according to the terms of her will—ha, ha!)
good heavens, save her!
moreover, that feeling in me has never been a secret to you
i’ve eaten a little and don’t want any more
not on your life!
he taught us to read and taught me grammar and religion, she added with dignity
nikolai petrovich seemed much more excited than his son; he seemed to have become a little flustered, grown timid as it were
vasily ivanovich's eyes suddenly opened wide, his cheeks flushed slightly
just stand there in front of her?
what did you say?
no one much liked raskolnikov; everyone shunned him
i’ll be absolutely frank with dmitry prokofich, right, dunya?
the same contrast between ideological argument in the foreground and a third set of values in the background quietly opposed to both camps is also written into the scenes at odintsova's
both women were waiting, this time completely convinced by razumikhin’s promise; in fact, he had really managed to bring zosimov
it was odd: as soon as he tried to select a key to the dresser, as soon as he heard the jingling, a shudder seemed to pass through him
what am i guilty of before them?
he was about to throw himself onto his knees to pray, but then he started laughing, not at the idea of prayer, but at himself
though how could he possibly have known what sort of rooms they really were?
be careful, you’ll start drinking!
odintseva watches this window as she will later watch her own face in the mirror—
she sat down next to raskolnikov, to whom she bowed hurriedly, and in passing cast an inquisitive glance at him
come to your senses!
it is this uniquely chekhovian combination which makes him too complex for some reductionist critics (in the east and the west alike), who perpetuate the futile controversy about whether chekhov's view of reality and mankind is positive-optimistic or negative-pessimistic
thus bazarov, everywhere and in everything, does only what he wishes or what seems to him to be advantageous or convenient
by the way, is your father still tax farming?
but she’s very smart, sir
in any attempt to assess turgenev's attitude to revolution and the ideals of his own generation, it is impossible to overlook his relations with herzen
everything was silent, only the cocks crowed boisterously in the village, arousing in any listeners a strange sensation of drowsiness and ennui; somewhere high above the treetops could be heard the unceasing plaintive screech of a fledgling hawk
i know you are used to luxury and pleasure, but even great men of the world are not averse to spending a little time beneath a cottage roof
you won’t leave me, will you, sonya?
bazarov and his fellow nihilists are merely preachers: they denounce phrases, rhetoric, inflated language—bazarov tells arkady not to talk so 'beautifully'—but only in order to substitute for this their own political propaganda; they offer not hard scientific facts, in which they are not interested, with which, indeed they are not acquainted, but slogans, diatribes, radical cant
the attack from the left inflicted wounds which festered for the rest of his life
do you hear me?
they both stopped and stared at each other for a minute, as if sizing each other up
you die from the heat getting there and die again on the way back
arkady said softly into his pillow, on which a tear had already fallen  suddenly he tossed back his hair and said aloud, why on earth did that idiot sitnikov turn up here?
i was merely defending myself at the time
i’ve become so muddled, he said to razumikhin in a completely different tone of voice, laughing
what, then, in your opinion, does he need?
that’s when i guessed, sonya, he continued with enthusiasm, that power is given only to the one who dares to bend down and pick it up
moreover, turgenev on many occasions in his life dissociated himself from revolution, whether simply by denying that he had any interest in politics or by declaring his liberal, gradualist views
veka, voprosy titeratury, , no
if you’re convinced that one shouldn’t eavesdrop, but that you can crack open the skulls of old ladies with anything at hand for your own enjoyment, then you’d best be off to america as soon as possible!
he was busy preparing their apartment
nastasya blurted out suddenly, turning to raskolnikov
eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity
sitnikov, kirsanov, bazarov grumbled without stopping
i just happened to drop in here
pavel petrovieh returns to the europe where he had once found happiness: in dresden  between two and four, at the most fashionable time for strolling, you can meet a man of about fifty, already completely grey and possibly suffering from gout, but still handsome, elegantly dressed, and with that special air which is given only to a person who has spent a long time amidst the highest strata of society
of science and knowledge?
yes, sir, that’s so, sir; the place of a mother, sir, sonya replied hastily and timidly
hmm, i think there’s also no reason to say
stop it, evgeny, for god's sake!
that was precisely the impression made on raskolnikov by the patron who was sitting alone and who looked like a former civil servant
what's to be done?
she invites him to visit her and asks him to bring bazarov
it was only the protest i wanted, but sofiya semyonovna herself felt that she couldn’t remain here in this apartment house!
i wait and hope—and that’s all!
live like this, raskolnikov said with a bitter smile
do you know whether i’m being followed?
i am going away for a long time; as you will agree, i am no tender creature, but i would prefer not to carry away with me the thought that you will remember me with repugnance
when he realized that he had no other sock, he put it back on again—and started laughing once more
for example, she understood the matter of kissing a woman’s hand perfectly—that is, that a man offends a woman by unequal treatment if he kisses her hand
where was he standing then and how could he see?
what money did you use to buy all this?
turgenev plays here with the boundaries of decorum, in a manner that both points to the seductive beyond, and holds to the compromises of convention
i took a ten-ruble note from the table and gave it to you, on my own behalf, as a contribution for your relative and as the first form of assistance
his heart began pounding  did he imagine at that moment the inevitable strangeness of future relations between him and his son?
the child who was asleep on the floor woke up and began crying
both young men left the room
let's not talk about it any more, anna sergeevna
after a moment he added:
don’t pay me any attention
we didn’t talk about it, first because it might happen later of its own accord; probably, he himself, without unnecessary words, will propose it (as if he could refuse this to dunya), all the more so since you yourself might become his right-hand man in the office and then you would receive this assistance not in the form of charity, but as earned income
there is no doubt of the negative service they perform
the social and topical, too, which forms the surface attention of his major novels, always is rooted in deeper psychological, psychohistorical, and philosophical concerns
are you talking about prison, sonya?
you said that so well
what could they prove definitively, even if they arrested him?
if you have something to say, then take a seat; you and nastasya are crowding each other there
ah, you, good lord!
then he grabbed the bolt and quietly, inaudibly slid it into place
i wrote you so much about her
i’m deciding this simply on the basis of my vileness and ineptitude, and perhaps the idea of advantage to myself, as that
cold and damp penetrated his whole body, and he began to shiver
katerina ivanovna herself, with her own hands, performed this nighttime chore at least twice a week, and sometimes more frequently, because things had reached the point that they had almost no clean clothes to change into
i myself am a shirker, and i’m keeping to that
that’s not good at all, sir
he would have been glad of it!
you’re being summoned to their office
what else is there?
excuse me for disturbing you, pavel petrovich said without looking at her
i remember it well
do whatever you think is best
his eyes were closed
what did you say?
that you told me about yourself?
that is, it's time for bed!
the narrator admires prosaic activities as if such happiness were possible only to limited people
at last they discharged him from the hospital
said raskolnikov with a smile
rodya, what are you saying?
to hospital take him!
you still have a little headache, don’t you?
here’s what i’d have done: i’d have taken the money and the items and, as soon as i’d left, immediately, without stopping anywhere, i’d have gone off somewhere to a remote spot where there were only fences, no one around—some garden or something like that
he cried with hatred
she whispered to razumikhin, almost in despair
arkady, on the other hand, considered it his duty, if not to help his father, then at least to display some willingness to help
it’s nonsense, i tell you
when necessary, i’ll come myself or
instead of an answer, he saw the girl’s face draw near his, her full lips innocently ready to kiss him
do you like it better here than in the wing where you were before?
never mind, it's no trouble; i have lots of time
when all three of them, razumikhin, raskolnikov, and sonya, had paused to say a few words on the sidewalk, this person walking by, passing them, suddenly shuddered, accidentally overhearing her words i asked, where does mr raskolnikov live?
we see each other once every five years
i’m so fed up with all this!
he’s made off with my twenty kopecks, raskolnikov muttered spitefully when left alone
she was a young woman, about twenty-three years old, all fair and soft, with dark hair and eyes, full, red, childlike lips, and sweet little hands
he’s a locksmith, a german, he’s rich
the hero and heroine tend to be dull but decent people, while the blocking characters are the truly interesting types
he suddenly felt he was all alone with a beautiful young woman
but enough about that and once again my sincere and warm thanks
in my opinion, that is, according to my personal conviction, that’s exactly the most normal condition of a woman
ah, why did you say that?
everyone gathered in the drawing room
i’m sure that she’s
it was already late in the day when he awoke after a disturbed sleep, but the sleep hadn’t fortified him
the supreme expression of bazarov's love for his parents comes with his ultimate sacrifice for their sake
i know it was stupid!
but this inflamed raskolnikov’s spite even further, and he could scarcely refrain from issuing a sarcastic and somewhat careless challenge
apparently, they were even somewhat afraid of katerina ivanovna; the lodgers, one after another, crowded back to the doorway with that same strange inner feeling of satisfaction that is always present, even in one’s nearest and dearest, when sudden misfortune strikes someone close; it spares no one at all, without exception, no matter how sincere our feelings of pity and sympathy
what the hell are they doing in there?
just as he thought: it was from his mother, in ryazan province
that is, we could start it even today
you see, there’s a belief about you (out there, somewhere) that you might be insane or close to it
i want to focus on death, but nothing comes of it
do you hear how the bolt rattles?
the inception of the novel marks a precise moment in time, a date: may ,
once again you’re bringing disgrace and debauchery to the whole street
it’s hard to talk to you!
kitty has strong feeling for both levin and vronsky, and both feelings might be called love
now, all of a sudden, when her entire heart was turned toward him, he felt and was aware that he had become immeasurably unhappier than before
i’m not even worth that man’s little finger,  he said
would he have been repulsed by the fact that it was too colossal and
yes, repeated bazarov gloomily, you are still a fool
porfiry petrovich was dressed informally, in a dressing gown, extremely clean linen, and well-worn slippers
she was sitting there all alone, in deep thought, and seemed to have been waiting for him a long time
both friends lay there for a while in silence
rodion romanovich, allow her to sit next to you
what will i do there?
no mushrooms or cucumbers, of course, and he shouldn’t have any beef, and
raskolnikov recoiled all the way to the back of the sofa, away from porfiry, who was leaning over him, and he stared directly at him in silent perplexity
no, present your facts!
there’s no need even to speak about ordinary people
isn’t this a sin?
yet for the last month i’ve been
he cried out once again, like a lost soul
recalling this period later, after a very long time, he surmised that his awareness had seemed to grow dim, and that this state continued, with certain interruptions, right up to the definitive catastrophe
almost the same thing was happening now with sonya: just as weakly, with the same fright, she looked at him for a while, and all of a sudden, stretching out her left hand, she gently pushed her fingers against his chest and slowly began standing up from the bed, moving farther and farther away from him, fixing her intense stare on him all the while
thank god, the doctor!
the dying man hardly understood anything; he could only utter disjointed and inarticulate sounds
the figure of bazarov suffered several transformations in successive drafts, up and down the moral scale as this or that friend or consultant reported his impressions
she herself doesn’t realize that it’s impossible to find justice among people, and she gets irritated
the young man uttered not one word in reply
that way sofiya semyonovna can rest easy
he walked along the embankment of the canal, and didn’t have much farther to go
you only pretend to condemn him; in reality you ingratiate yourself with him, and await a single careless smile of his as a favor!
(this profession of incomprehension will be odintseva's later defense as well, masking her attraction to bazarov and her flirtation with him)
here he is, prokofich, began nikolai petrovich
do you have such a high opinion of the germans?
but you just said something about odintsova  that's what you called her, right?
a hideous, lost smile took shape on his lips
what a word can mean!
and the good little peasants are taking your father for all he's worth
a riotous song bursts forth, tambourines jingle, and whistles sound in the chorus
so this is where you have got to!
you were registered there
it is, of course, the narrator—and not bazarov—who has seen odintseva naked; turgenev reallots the mythic roles, and makes his actaeon a willful—not innocent—transgressor
he pushed the newspapers away and turned to face zametov
as  note in my monograph, what shklovsky and fischler have in mind, i think, is aristotle's concept of comedy
she seemed to raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for marmeladov
katerina ivanovna made a point of intentionally inviting this lady and her daughter, whose shoelaces she was unfit to tie, all the more so since up to then in any incidental meeting, the lady would haughtily turn her face away—so that this lady would know that here respectable people have thoughts and feelings, and invite others without holding a grudge, and so that she would see that katerina ivanovna was not used to living in such circumstances
he’s an unstable young fellow, nothing more; he might have seemed promising
maybe i should get drunk, too?
he said, shaking his head again, feeling embarrassed, compassionate, and indignant
that is, not exactly about tubercles
raskolnikov was silent, staring at the floor, thinking about something
it seems so to me, sir
let’s go, mama, said avdotya romanovna
just as i thought!
he was ashamed of the fact that he, raskolnikov, had come to grief so blindly, hopelessly, obscurely, and stupidly, by some decree of blind fate, and that he had to humble himself and submit to the nonsense of such a decree if he ever wanted to set his mind at rest
and he didn’t even tell me!
but you don’t even hide it!
did you hear anything, some noise or anything else?
but it all ended in catastrophe, which you already know, and you yourself can judge what a pitch of rage i reached when i learned that marfa petrovna had found that vile official luzhin and practically arranged a marriage—one that, in fact, was just like the one i was offering
the hair was cut short and worn straight, and the wearer frequently assumed dark glasses
gradually the previous image of dunechka began to appear before him; all of a sudden a tremor passed through his whole body
listen to me, and listen carefully: the caretaker, kokh, pestryakov, another gentleman, the caretaker’s wife, and the woman who was sitting with her in the lodge at the time, and the court councillor kryukov, who, at that very moment, got out of a cab and entered through the gateway, arm in arm with a woman—everyone, that is eight or ten witnesses, unanimously testify that nikolai had pushed dmitry down on the ground and was lying on top of him, punching him, while he had grabbed hold of nikolai’s hair and was also punching him
the coffin will be a simple one, sir
and can’t even manage such a small expenditure
now he’s turned toward progressive politics; he hasn’t a clue about it, but i encourage him, of course
his broad face, with prominent cheekbones, was rather pleasant; his complexion was fresh, not typical of petersburg
these powerful, all-knowing circles, which despised and attacked everyone, had for a long time inspired petr petrovich with a particular kind of fear, one that was, however, completely undefined
yes  and in general
she repeated, beside herself
well, sir, i may be a swine, but she is a lady!
only one ruble and fifteen kopecks now?
but anna  et voilà tout: and that's all (french)
all at once he recalled it all in one moment
i do, raskolnikov replied firmly; while saying this he stared down at the ground, as he had done during the entire course of his long tirade, having selected a spot on the rug
his face, extremely fresh and even ruddy, seemed younger than his forty-five years, even without his new clothes
i only wish, before signing off, to say a few words to my young contemporaries, my colleagues who embark on the slippery field of literature
why did i come here?
it's a bitter pill—but one must swallow it
realizing this and not paying any more attention, she went to the hall door to close it; then, catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold, she suddenly screamed
even his hair, with only a slight trace of gray, had been combed and curled by a barber, but this fact didn’t make him look comical or foolish, as usually happens with curled hair, because it inevitably conveys to the face the look of a german about to get married
he finished ’er off!
i think he's coming, peter whispered all of a sudden
i owe him my regeneration
so you deny knowledge of the other hundred rubles?
they were now standing in front of the last staircase, next to the landlady’s door, and in fact there was light coming from underneath the door to raskolnikov’s little room
'how do i know?
dunyasha ran back and forth like a madwoman and kept slamming doors; meanwhile peter, even at three o'clock in the morning, was still trying to strum a cossack waltz on the guitar
i ran away from them to rent an apartment so they wouldn’t be able to find me; i grabbed a pile of money to take with me
it's probably all the same to you, but you should know that not only would not i trade you for your sister, i would not trade you for anyone else in the world
it’s in the fourth gospel, she whispered sternly, not approaching him
up to a certain point
is bazarov a forerunner of the politically committed, militant soviet intellectual, or a malicious caricature of the fathers of russian communism?
i have just seen him; it's his custom, as you probably know, to get up very early and explore the area
everything about sonya seemed somehow stranger and more astounding with each passing minute
but all of this constant anxiety and mental anguish couldn’t pass without consequences
i didn’t even think about it at the time, i simply didn’t want to
do people out in this province of ours still believe in rademacher?
all along i have been thinking about what i want to say to you  brother, fulfill your obligation, the obligation of an honest, generous man; end temptation and the bad example you are setting, you, the best of men
with princess r  especially the upper part of her face
she supported her round face on her small closed fist
and bazarov is consigned to the infinite future of life after death, as suggested by the flowers growing on his grave, which, the narrator concludes, speak of eternal reconciliation and life everlasting (:  [p ])
yes, i clearly remember him; i could pick him out of a thousand
what didn’t he say yesterday, good lord!
you take mine, you give up yours, without regrets, without turning back
well, then, on the contrary!
avdotya romanovna noticed it
she had her own capital
the danger of groveling before the people at one moment, distorting them the next, then crediting them with sacred and high convictions, and then branding them unfortunate and insane
the singer’s thin voice warbled
fenechka, who was trying to decipher in a low voice the article on creosote
even though i was standing far away, i saw everything, everything, and even though from the window it was hard to make out a banknote—you’re right about that—by a special circumstance i know for certain that it was indeed a hundred-ruble banknote, because when you were just about to give sofiya semyonovna a ten-ruble note—i myself saw it—at the same time you took from the table a hundred-ruble note
all the same, i won’t look at it through your eyes: if i had succeeded, i’d have been crowned, but now i’ve fallen into a trap!
careers forged through one's own work are always more secure and broader than a career built with low bows or the intercession of an important uncle
he continued, almost aloud
this last word uttered in english went almost unnoticed, but everyone was touched
well, of course, you’re right
in brief, in spite of the kind and generous treatment by marfa petrovna, mr svidrigaylov’s wife, and all the servants, dunechka had a very difficult time, especially when mr svidrigaylov, following old regimental custom, was under the influence of bacchus
my business is inconsequential, but god knows what people might think
i keep posing that question to myself, sonya
so, you still believe in the new jerusalem?
help me get into the droshky and do not give way to melancholy
i believe mejerchol would was absolutely right in perceiving that bazarov is more poet than scientist, a position i wish to extend in this paper, in the hope that it not only will provide yet another interpretation of fathers and sons, but will in some small measure add to the growing body of work that seeks to offset the currently reigning clichés about turgenev's status as a writer in the distinctively russian literary tradition
ordinary individuals are condemned to disappear in the whole, to be swallowed up in its stream; but they augmented its force, broadened and deepened its course—what more could they want?
they had both been brought in from the street
that’s an old woman’s selfishness
what good would it do you?
in addition, your family has now come to see you; you should think about them
bazarov repeats, not at all having expected such events
finally he reached a narrow street; half dead, he turned into it; here he was somewhat safe and understood this: there would be less suspicion, a crowd of people scurrying about, and he would blend into it like a grain of sand
due to your idleness and depravity, raskolnikov interrupted
there are not any general principles— you have not even figured that out yet—there are only sensations
bazarov now gives way to impotent fury, vindictiveness, malice:
it was an effective picture!
nevertheless, you’ll simply drive yourself mad like that, so help me god, sir!
() matvei ilyich's suavity of demeanour was equalled only by his stately manner
call the police, and i’ll swear an oath!
treat bazarovism however you please—that is your business; but you will not be able to put a stop to it; it is just the same as cholera
weekly discourses ceased publication, which is why it wasn’t published there
and it seems even more likely that dostoevsky, author of the magnificent birth scene in the possessed and of the unforgettable burial scene in the brothers karamazov (bratia kara-mazovy), understood turgenev's affirmation of the reconciliation and continuity of generations, his affirmation of young life at play as that which makes bearable the inevitability of the grave
you’ll end up like that!
i’ll repay you with my life, i will!
for a minute they stared at each other in silence
where had these feelings come from?
why did i get so smashed?
i saw it as i came past
perhaps you find them ridiculous?
bazarov and his friends will discover nothing; they are not researchers; they are mere ranters, men who declaim in the name of a science which they do not trouble to master; in the end they are no better than the ignorant, benighted russian priesthood from whose ranks they mostly spring, and far more dangerous
that’s what i said
we don’t have any provinces where i come from, your excellency, but districts
porfiry left, slouching a little and trying to avoid looking at raskolnikov
he bent over, grabbed the top of the block powerfully with both hands, gathered all his strength, and turned it over
i wanted to forget everything and start all over again, sonya, and to stop chattering!
in spite of these strange words, he felt very wretched
i might indirectly serve the cause of their development and our propaganda
in truth, it’s ridiculous that i’ve set out to see razumikhin
and what will we do?
i know the story—how and why it was conceived
there was no reason to ring in vain, and it wasn’t in his nature
and in schools, too?
i can’t express it to you; here—you’re good at math, and i know you’re still studying now
i have not seen him or my mother for a long time; one must console the old folks
let’s get down to business
he is fully capable of treating bazarov as an intellectual equal, but he writes from a position as far above arkady and katya as, let us say, balzac's narrator is above eugenie grandet
feeling cold and barely conscious, he opened the door to the office
his difficulties with the farm increased with every passing day—cheerless, senseless difficulties
she brought her crushed fingers to her lips, blew on them, and then, suddenly, stood up abruptly from her chair and headed to the door with rapid steps, as if wishing to call bazarov back  the maid came into the room carrying a pitcher on a silver tray
sonya looked at him attentively
you should have treated her differently
as for that money
we all came here together, since we couldn’t let her come alone
i myself know of one work that will definitely suit
their conversation ended here
fortunately, there was an easy topic for conversation, and he seized upon it quickly
the doctor, the same country doctor who lacked the caustic, arrived and after examining the patient, advised them to continue waiting it out and then added a few words about the possibility of recovery
the fat lieutenant colonel (in reality, a retired second lieutenant) also didn’t attend, but it turned out that he had been dead tired since yesterday morning
he grabbed his cap and headed for the door
you don’t know it—but that’s what they thought!
that would be even better
it would be interesting to know what people fear the most
is he still so timid in your presence?
here chekhov only echoes turgenev's potugin (smoke, ), who, despite his mordant skepticism, is confident that what happened with the russian language (its capacity to absorb the violent impact of alien forms) will take place also in other spheres
what on earth for?
some sort of carriage stood amidst the throng
replying to them, he spoke for three-quarters of an hour, constantly interrupted and cross-examined
she did not know whether he was joking or not
might it be possible somehow to sidestep any questions about my sister and not mention her name?
from time to time he stumbled upon signs for little shops and greengrocers, and he read each one carefully
there was no argument: raskolnikov had already managed to compromise himself too much, but no facts had yet been established
i loved my wife for one whole year,
any indecision, you mean
then sitnikov jumped into his carriage and, after bellowing at two passing peasants, put on your caps, you idiots!
i was very frivolous
bazarov wound up losing a sum of money that, though insignificant, was still not altogether pleasant for him
to a f onegin
their words are all so ordinary, but there’s something to them
lyonya didn’t have a costume; she wore only the late semyon zakharych’s red knitted worsted cap (or, rather, nightcap), into which a broken piece of white ostrich feather had been inserted: it had belonged to katerina ivanovna’s grandmother and had been kept in a trunk up to now as a family treasure
it’s just that, rodion romanovich, old boy, i know about your other exploits, too; i know everything, sir!
i ask you to finish, said raskolnikov
much better if we go and look at a beetle
he had reached this decision a while ago, when he awoke
he muttered, standing aimlessly in the entrance, directly opposite the door to the caretaker’s small dark lodgings, also left open
rodion romanovich, old boy!
arkady asked in turn
by morning, in the low-lying parts of town, water will pour onto the streets, flooding basements and cellars; the sewer rats will emerge, and amidst the rain and wind, people, soaking wet and cursing, will begin hauling their stuff up to the higher floors
the shovel slid from his hands
you keep interrupting me, and we
good lord, could it have been that money
he returns to this in one of his late poems in prose: 'honest souls turned away from him
when, shuddering, he once again lifted his head and glanced around, he immediately forgot what he’d been thinking about and even where he’d been going
he didn’t even say good-bye to her; he had already forgotten her; one scathing and rebellious doubt flared up in his soul
his feeling toward pavel petrovich is not exactly amicable; he is annoyed by the element of haughtiness in him, but he involuntarily tries to conceal his irritation under the guise of disdainful indifference
too much alike in us
unexpectedly seeing a room full of people, she wasn’t merely embarrassed, but overwhelmed; she felt timid as a child and even made a move to leave
friday, your exc-c-c-c-cellency, the day of the week
how can i tell rodya not to come?
the closer they got to his house, the more and more the drunken man was overcome by embarrassment and fear
you’re right, she doesn’t like me; but you mustn’t vouch for what happens between a husband and his wife, or between a man and his mistress
among other things, he said that the governor, bourdaloue,  had issued a special order to all his subordinates to wear spurs, just in case he should have to dispatch them on horseback in a great hurry
he hesitated a moment and then went on in french
in that case, it would not be a bad idea to have a little snooze, arkady observed
while saying this, svidrigaylov himself was extremely calm and cool
it’s not that i can’t stand him, but he was the cause of my quarrel with marfa petrovna, when i found out that she had concocted this wedding
(but i’m drinking a great deal of wine and prattling on)

you must still be very ill you shouldn’t have gone out
well, give me the shirt; where are the stockings?
well, sir, i, her own father, took those thirty kopecks to ease my hangover!
only irrefutable facts, only useful knowledge, matter
we’ve been pleased to make do with other people’s ideas—and we’ve gotten used to it!
he no longer argued with pavel petrovich, all the more so because the latter assumed an excessively aristocratic demeanor in his presence and expressed his opinions more with sounds than words
but as soon as he’d touched the clothes, a gold watch slipped out from under the fur coat
here he alludes to the very same saying—happy people have no history— that appears in the notebooks for anna karenina and resulted in the most famous first sentence of any novel: all happy families resemble each other; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
therefore, luzhin must possess good qualities
but now, for some reason, he was suddenly drawn to people
when arkady courts her, nature is one of the most important elements in their growing relationship
just think, it seems that horrible man was the cause of her death
[fathers and sons, ch ]
turgenev thus frames his narrative with diametrically opposed conceptions of time, one concrete and limited, the other highly abstract and limitless
what if petr petrovich refuses?
why should you listen to me?
noticing that fifi had made a few hesitant steps in her direction, she cried, shoo, shoo!
a tall watchtower caught his eye on the left
there was a smile on his lips, and some sort of new, irritated impatience shone through his smile
i don’t understand such expressions when used to describe human activity
you yourself wanted me to go; now i’ll be sitting in prison and your wish will be fulfilled; why are you crying?
but nikolai’s confession was a genuine fact
what a splendid woman anna sergeevna is, exclaimed arkady, when left alone later with his companion in the room reserved for them
my sister worked as a governess in his house
we’ve tormented her enough!
however, on that score, all was well for the time being; after seeing his pale, dignified face, which had grown fuller of late, petr petrovich even felt consoled for a moment in the full conviction that he could find another bride somewhere else, and she might even be a better one; but he immediately came to his senses and spat vigorously to one side, which caused his young friend and roommate, andrey semyonovich lebezyatnikov to smile sarcastically
yes, and they continue to slip out
but this bloodletting may even be good for me
what did you see, sir?
here’s your letter, she began, placing it on the table
who would testify against himself?
the family, then, the family as it exists among our peasants!
they both left quietly and closed the door
she was trying to say that he walked around with his hands in his pockets, but it came out that he picked other people’s pockets
sonya paused at the threshold, but didn’t cross it and looked like a lost soul
i won’t go to see them now
the secretary in one of our embassies was murdered for some enigmatic financial dealings
just now i went into a shop and left a young girl to watch over her—and here’s what happened!
as soon as he gets married, i will go somewhere far away, to dresden or florence and live there until i pass on
marmeladov, before entering the room, sank to his knees in the doorway, while he pushed raskolnikov forward
i’m not that foolish
and therefore thank you again
odintseva's house, like her life, is a model of absolute order, established by the dead husband whose spirit still presides
i hoped to get some cash!
razumikhin will find me
sit down, you must be tired!
he knew that change could only be achieved by pressure
but allow me, nikolai petrovich began
who are you looking for?
the old man interrupted
before him was an extremely young face, about sixteen, perhaps even only fifteen—a little face, under fair hair, pretty, but quite flushed and seemingly swollen
everything’s out of sight—the purse, too!
sonya hastened to restrain katerina ivanovna; but when amaliya ivanovna suddenly yelled something about a yellow ticket, katerina ivanovna pushed sonya away and went after amaliya ivanovna to carry out her threat about the cap immediately
all right; speak, but quickly!
he kept pacing the room in silence, without glancing at her
do stay  it's nice talking to you  like walking along the edge of an abyss
you know, do not you, the elegant side of life is inaccessible to me, that side you value so highly
go away; leave us altogether!
throughout the novel the high-mindedness, dedication, and energy that make bazarov tower over the other characters are occasionally expressed with an immaturity bordering on adolescent revolt
we belong to different generations, and is now resigned to his turn having come to swallow the pill
arina vlasevna had had time to dress up; she would put on a tall cap with silk ribbons and a light blue patterned shawl
raskolnikov continued down the stairs
well, we’ll see how it turns out there
but justice forces me to put forward the proposition that the author of fathers and sons acted thus not without an insidious intention
he knew that anna sergeevna was alone with bazarov, but felt none of his previous jealousy; on the contrary, his face was brightening slowly; he seemed to be surprised at something, delighted by it, and had made up his mind about it
is what you wrote really possible?
all this is so ordinary, it’s all relative, all purely form
this morning dunya had received some sort of letter!
he’d stood up at the guests’ arrival and was standing there waiting, his mouth wide open in a smile, but regarding the whole scene in bewilderment and even disbelief; he looked at raskolnikov with some confusion
i didn’t believe, yet just now i was embracing and kissing my mother; i am not a believer, yet i asked her to pray for me
did porfiry wink at me just now or not?
everything around him had grown dark and quiet, and fenechka's face appeared before him, so small and pale
directly to the right of the gate stretched the long, blank unwhitewashed wall of the adjacent four-story building
do you have such a high opinion of yourself?
raskolnikov said suddenly, with an expression of the most impatient annoyance
thank goodness the details aren’t necessary, as much as the heart of the matter; but if, if only he was capable, if svidrigaylov was devising some intrigue against dunya, then
taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door
only pray for me
this cleanliness costs money
victor, you know i am angry with you
learning is not only light, according to the russian proverb—it is freedom as well
objects shifted and swirled, like a whirlwind
bazarov agreed, saying he really needed to prepare himself in advance for a career as a country doctor
what did he say?
was he aware that his son might have shown him more respect if he would never mentioned the subject?
i’d be afraid to be in your room at night, he observed glumly
there are no such roles in a commune
that's all romanticism, nonsense, rot, and artsy nonsense [chudozestvo]
all that day we pondered and considered it together
as for bazarov, he does not aspire to become a provincial bigwig: if his imagination sometimes pictures the future, then this future is somehow indefinitely broad; he works without a goal, in order to earn his crust of bread or from love of the process of work, but, nevertheless, he vaguely feels that given the caliber of his mind his work will not pass without a trace and will lead to something
with everyone in the house]
other thoughts flooded his mind
it’s so terribly stuffy in his room
that cuckoo is to blame for everything

as a result of her small size, the blow came down on the crown of her head
similarly, it has been pavel's unspoken antipathy toward the idea of his brother's marrying a peasant girl that has caused nikolai to wait so long before regularizing his liaison with fenechka
and yet their life, the human element in their feelings is not insignificant
these lectures produced a sensation among not only the students, but all petersburg
he, too, had probably seen her from a distance and was trying to catch up with her, but raskolnikov had hindered him
sitnikov once again emitted a shrill laugh
what use is it?
perhaps the mistress is german?
as you know, the whole affair turned out to be nothing
and in this atom, in this mathematical dot, the blood circulates, the brain works, there's even a desire for something
consequently, those winters in petersburg when he would spent endless days studying the latest works had all been in vain; in vain had he listened in on those young people's conversations; in vain had he rejoiced when he managed to insert a word or two into their heated discussions
i don’t understand a thing!
she very much wanted to find out what he was talking about with the landlady because she was completely enamored with razumikhin
the passage immediately following this one is the paraphrase of bazarov's contempt for the madness of
namely, when the editors of the contemporary started to assure its subscribers in print that they had dispensed with me for my wretched convictions (while in fact i would not publish there— despite their pleas—for which i have documentary proof), i could not keep up my character, and publicly proclaimed what was involved, and of course, suffered a complete fiasco!
but most likely you won’t blame me for my unintended silence
he stopped taking walks alone and began seeking company; he took tea in the living room, wandered around the garden with vasily ivanovich, and smoked his pipe with him in peace and quiet; he even inquired once about father aleksei

i was out in the rain yesterday, mama
do you know the details?
but there was no bride, nothing ever happened—it was all a mirage!
bazarov attempts to locate himself existentially in the space/time continuum and manages to perceive his own insignificance compared not only to his parents', but to the infinity of space and the eternity of time
it would be better to swear on your father's moneybags
think what could be more terrible than not loving and not being loved!
the old woman’s scribbles on the items, let’s say, so on and so forth—all that’s rubbish, sir
porfiry waited impatiently for raskolnikov to leave
in any case, i have been punished enough
nikolai petrovich also stood up
fathers and sons (and daughters)
a minute later, he was already on the street
the devil only knows
cried sonya almost in despair, and she clutched her head
a living, whole man is caught by the author in each of bazarov's actions and movements
it was strange: he suddenly seemed completely calm; there was none of his half-crazed delirium as before, none of the overwhelming fear he’d experienced previously
well, all right, all right!
replied raskolnikov apathetically and walked out ahead, descending the stairs slowly
the techniques employed by the nihilists did not in themselves imply a politico-revolutionary view of life

but for katkov's persistent demands fathers and sons would never have appeared
it was very stupid
nevertheless, bjoring, who knew the truth, was frightened

but understand, anna, understand  he said in a low voice, hurrying

prince andrei, despite the quick driving and the sleepless night, felt himself still more animated than the day before as he pulled up to the palace
it seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must go for naught and be meaningless, if he did not put it to work and again take an active part in life

when he had calmed down a little, he explained to rostov that he lived with his mother, that if his mother saw him dying, she would not survive it

were the sounds somehow peculiar, significant?
and here is lukyan timofeich … the prince wants to sleep, lukyan timofeich; about-face!
liberalism is not a sin; it is a necessary part of the whole, which without it would fall apart or atrophy; liberalism has the same right to exist as the most well-mannered conservatism; what i am attacking is russian liberalism, and i repeat again that i attack it essentially because a russian liberal is not a russian liberal, but is a non-russian liberal
soon a woman in a red cap stuck herself out the door holding a hot pot of dumplings with both hands, and placed it in the midst of those ready to eat

he was about to embrace her, but she retreated, blushing, so as not to have her dress rumpled

he was in hunting dress, still all dusty, wearing high boots and holding a crop in his hand
some of our liberals, still not long ago, took this hatred of russia for all but a genuine love of the fatherland and boasted of seeing better than others what it should consist of; but by now they’ve become more candid, and have even begun to be ashamed of the words love of the fatherland,  have even banished and removed the very notion as harmful and worthless
what's that to me?

it is hardly a scientific way to proceed

when he went outside, akaky akakievich was as if in a dream
love only added fuel to the fire
at least everybody complains that there are none
and to tell the truth, for the majority of our young ladies, it did not matter whom they married, as long as they got married
he went out to the garden
he asked, showing d'artagnan a place where it had been pierced through

sofya semyonovna is not at home
however, the reason i maintain that, the prince suddenly picked up, obviously wishing to correct himself, is because people back then (i swear to you, it has always struck me) were not at all the same sort of people as we are now, not the same breed as now, in our time, really, like a different species … at that time people were somehow of one idea, while now they’re more nervous, more developed, sensitive, somehow of two or three ideas at once … today’s man is broader—and, i swear, that’s what keeps him from being such a monolithic man as in those times … i … i said it solely with that in mind, and not …

but my coughing went on and did not let up for about three more minutes
while listening to the whisper and feeling this stretching edifice of needles being raised, prince andrei had glimpses of the red circle of light around the candle and heard the rustling of cockroaches and of the fly striking against the pillow and his face
besides, i might have been mistaken
you, too, if you please, young man

we are working people, we ca not be bothered with trifles
ganya saw it, frowned, vexedly took it from the table, and flung it onto his desk, which was at the other end of the room
he drove away thought; thought tortured him
i think about twenty minutes passed that way
all the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then

the other day at the apraksins' i heard a lady ask: 'c'est ça le fameux prince andré?
captain, she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking russian confidently, though with a strong german accent, and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, and it's the whole truth i am telling, mr

as for aramis, he never gambled
he moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days
and he loved me more than the others, and all because i wept from his akathists
what i said then i do not remember at all, and i hardly spoke coherently, hardly even articulated the words clearly; but he listened intently
recently he had received so many other and such serious impressions—the abandoning of smolensk, his visit to bald hills, the recent news of his father's death—and had experienced so many feelings, that these memories had not come to him for a long time, and when they came, were far from affecting him with their former strength

in response to lauriston's proposal of peace, he replied that there could be no peace, because such was the will of the people; he alone, during the french retreat, said that all our maneuvers are unnecessary, that everything was getting done by itself, better than we could wish, that the enemy should be given a golden bridge, that the battles of tarutino, vyazma, and krasnoe were unnecessary, that they had to have some men left when they got to the border, that he would not give up one russian even for ten frenchmen
—but i refrained from asking questions out of pride

god be with you  he muttered
a saber for the master here
and you’ll be received, there’s no doubt of that, don’t worry!
well, it's not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or not
i read it myself and we both laughed: some russian mme
but he wants, then, to draw down on that head the punishment reserved for the damned!
natasha sat down with sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting prince andrei to join her
she's walking through the church with her eyes closed, constantly spreading her arms as if wishing to catch someone
a last explanation: i am by no means dying because i cannot endure these three weeks; oh, i would have strength enough, and if i wanted to, i could be sufficiently comforted by the very consciousness of the offense done to me; but i am not a french poet and do not want such comforting

i left the tavern confused and agitated, went straight home, and the next day continued my little debauch still more timidly, downtroddenly, and sadly than before, as if with a tear in my eye – yet i did continue it
what did he say?
i decidedly refused: i have daughters
where are you here?
he asked himself in perplexity

these senseless nights, and such uninteresting, unremarkable days!
great vast lakes lie between the mountains
she would not let go of her mother, struggled with her gently, called for pillows, water, unbuttoned and tore open her mother's dress

iii: the audience well, then, captain, said porthos, beside himself, the truth is that we were six against six, but we were set upon treacherously, and before we had time to draw our swords, two of us had fallen dead, and athos, grievously wounded, was hardly worth more

pierre, accompanied by the maid, wanted to reach the place where the general was standing, but french soldiers stopped him
such willfulness on the part of his nose vexed the judge still more

the impression princess marya made on rostov was very pleasant
this morning the spanish deputies came to me, and i got into the carriage together with them
i do not mock you!

she was dressed extremely simply
schiller was sitting, his rather fat nose stuck out and his head raised, while hoffmann was holding him by this nose with two fingers and waggling the blade of his cobbler's knife just above the surface of it

he had noted very well and had positive knowledge that a young man of very good name, and living in a most worthy family, gavrila ardalionovich ivolgin, whom she knew and received in her house, had long loved her with all the force of passion and would certainly give half his life just for the hope of obtaining her sympathy
the women all go there to throw out whatever they do not need
i had a bite and a drink

that's solokha for you!
oh, loving, over‐partial hearts!
it was mutually and amicably agreed between totsky and the general that for the time being they would avoid any formal and irrevocable steps
it made for such losses!
i wo not describe the rest of that night, the fuss, and then the official visits; till dawn i literally shivered and considered it my duty not to go to bed, though, anyhow, i did not do anything
no, it ca not, he said to himself at her every glance, gesture, word, which filled his soul with joy
and that is even the most likely thing of all

do you know, sonia, he said suddenly with conviction, let me tell you: if i would simply killed because i was hungry, laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, i should be happy now
little sensitive as d'artagnan's heart was, he felt touched by this mute suffering; but he was too keen on his plans, and above all on this one, to change anything in the program he had laid out in advance
i ask you to forgive me
i say i like the proud ones myself

put us up wherever you like
dormant eyes, and the rest were in the same vein

is it about nikolushka?
lord, is this any company for me!
there's the feather‐bed element here, brother—ach!
pierre again assumed the symmetrically naïve pose of an egyptian statue, evidently regretting that his clumsy and fat body took up so much space, and applying all his inner forces to making himself seem as small as possible

he read a lot, wrote often
an officer still more rarely performs the action itself and still more often gives orders
