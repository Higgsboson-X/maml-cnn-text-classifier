at five pm today, mr karamazov borrowed ten rubles from me, as a friend
the money you won the day before yesterday is still intact; not one kopek of it is missing: it comes to exactly three thousand—that is, three rubles short of three thousand
alyosha suddenly turned beet-red
i hope he’s not jealous of maximushka, at least
i looked at her and saw that the voice in my ear wasn’t lying
in general, he avoided expressing value judgments, except on abstract matters, and that was particularly true when it came to sergei sokolsky
but, of course, i would not even think of revealing any of them here
then he suddenly realized that he was terribly hungry
but what if the beauty turns her attention to that insignificant and 'immature' fellow standing in a corner and seething with rage, and what if she singles him out from the whole crowd of her admirers?
and i do not care if it costs me my reputation or not, but i will save him!
would you tell us now why you urgently had to have precisely that sum: three thousand rubles, that is?
talk of a nun!
she suddenly turned bright crimson, as if realizing she would done something foolhardy
so we have here a criminal who does not have enough sense to take the proper precautions and who runs away from the scene of the crime, leaving behind evidence that is bound to incriminate him, but two minutes later, after he has struck and felled another victim, he suddenly is supposed to have become the coolest, the most calculating criminal, just because it suits the argument
i stood there for a few moments, looking out into the darkness
when you were telling us earlier that you would rather be sent to siberia than reveal that mystery, we were quite puzzled
how can you remember that?
no, no, it's not at all official for the time being
for i’ve been anchored in this spot for five days now
all i know is that i was in a great hurry to see you
after living quite a long time abroad, far away from mother, his love for her suddenly came back, in absentia as it were, and he sent for her
he spoke to her like a gentle and affectionate little boy
and when i blurted out so casually about the document and saw his stupid, frightened look, i felt an irresistible urge to crush him under a wealth of detail
as i jumped into the bedroom and stumbled against the bed, i noticed to my relief that there was a door connecting that room with the kitchen, which meant that there was, after all, a possible escape for me
she stood in the doorway looking at perezvon
he's very anxious to see you and so's his wife
'what are you doing here, you with the beard?
it would have been rather indecent, quite shocking, in fact
and i asked everyone questions about you
he explained that it was an official statement addressed to the highest local authorities and that, since those highest authorities were present there in his house, he would read the document aloud for everyone to hear
i never even had any such unconscious wish (although i did keep the document sewn into the lining of my pocket and i sometimes touched that pocket with a peculiar little grin)
also, from time to time, the town’s high society would gather at mr makarov’s house for a dance, the mothers chaperoning their unmarried daughters
i was still very anxious to have an open and uninhibited talk with him
get out of here, you!
alyosha went down on his knees and bowed to the ground before the sleeping elder
as far as i’m concerned, they can keep my fifty rubles, kalganov said
never look into his eyes, you won’t learn anything from them—it’s like looking into a murky pond
why should it be incumbent upon me to save the honor of the family?
indeed, i can even imagine a sign: prince so-and-so, bootmaker
but you told me the day and the time, remember?
kalganov rolled about with laughter, that boyish laughter of his, so violently that he almost fell onto the sofa
he did not do so out of any deliberate malice or resentment toward the child’s mother, but simply because he forgot all about the little boy
i didn’t say i’d beat up chizhov, you spiteful woman
otherwise you would not be the vasin i know
when i was only eleven, mon cher, my tutor scolded me for staring too much at the statues in the summer gardens
she's such a delightful creature!
but ilyusha did not like to see his father clowning and trying to make him laugh
i believe we shall achieve it with the help of christ
everyone has his own private idea, i said, my eyes fixed on the teacher, who looked at me in silence with a smile on his face
don’t worry, i’m not a madman
an hour later, he would answer the offender or speak to him himself, with a trustful, friendly look, as if nothing had happened
it is not that i am so fully convinced of the perfection of these family traditions but simply that at least they provide certain definite forms to serve as bases for concepts such as 'honor' and  woulduty
well, in fact
as to every man being answerable for everybody and everything, not just for his own sins, he went on, you are absolutely right about it, and the way you succeeded in grasping that idea so fully, all at once, is really remarkable
i’m sorry for him, and that doesn’t go well with love
in fact, we don’t need anything
i forbid you to, once and for all
mitya suddenly heard the voice of kalganov, who had appeared from nowhere
why did you tug at my sleeve?
do not you see how hard you are making it for mother!
forgive me, pan wrublewski, it won’t happen again!
right, right, and, as i was saying, one head is good, but two is much, much better, dr herzenstube went on stubbornly
the table was laid as usual in the living room, although there was a proper dining room in the house
and then, you keep telling me i’m stupid
maxim drove off, but he did not give up
if you did, i’d be delighted in a way, because it would prove that you’d come to believe i really exist
these two often argued with each other about all sorts of problems of everyday life and nastya, the older of the two, always came up with the clinching argument
they seemed to be arguing about something, one trying to convince the other, begging perhaps, while the other disagreed and refused to comply
man is weak and despicable
and from then on, it was as if a shadow of doom had come over her
please do not glare at me as if you were about to tear me to pieces, mrs prutkov; try to laugh it off instead—that would be much better
i want you to know
i tried to walk in but he barred the way with his body and wouldn’t let me pass
that’s what we’ve come to, is it?
they leapt to their feet
do i know myself what i’m after?
you didn’t stop me because you hate me
oh, tatyana, why do you say all that about him now
there were also flowerbeds all around the church and between the graves in the churchyard
the presiding judge was a squat, thick-set man of about fifty, with a hemorrhoidal complexion and dark, graying, close-cropped hair, and the red ribbon of some order, i no longer know which
neither his originality nor his fascinating character, neither his complicated scheming nor his strange adventures, not even the presence of my mother at his side could stop me any longer now
so only you, your late father, and smerdyakov knew the signals?
so you’re pushing me out of the house yourself, to go to your damned chermashnya, right?
i took advantage of the opportunity to make him talk, as i was quite intrigued
at the same time he ordered his servants not to admit grushenka to the house and, if she came, to tell her that he wished her a long and happy life and many good times, and that he wanted her to forget him
yes, he was certainly more practical than me but hardly more of a realist
i wanted to cry out: so you are afraid of my excessive ardor, you are not sure of what i might do?
he slumped down to the floor and i whacked him again and then once more
perhaps in the inn, like the other day?
i also felt that my dilemma of what to do about the letter concerning the lawsuit had become even more difficult to decide
no, i mean, will you forgive me for all the others?
what need was there, i ask you, to represent my client as an insensitive monster?
lambert, you are horrible and disgusting!
she was weeping too
but he had kept most of these secrets even from his family, confiding to his niece maria and to kraft only as much as he thought necessary
and karamazov now knew how to handle dmitry: the fellow could always be placated, at least temporarily, with small handouts
yet, despite all that, there was so much light in her face, so much faith in the future, that alyosha felt guilty before her; he felt he had done her serious and deliberate harm
and you decided to take the short cut!
did you really believe it?
what an awful night it must have been!
i remember that he was the most puzzled of all, once he had made the acquaintance of the young man, who interested him a great deal and with whom he used to exchange sophisticated barbs, although his feelings were often secretly hurt when he was bested in these confrontations
only smoldering corpses lay
altogether, i remained there for almost four hours
you know all those people, they all receive you
some of these times were of a rather morbid nature: debauched in his sensuality and often cruel, like some vicious insect, karamazov was occasionally, especially when drunk, subject to moments of mental anguish, of torment arising from a feeling of guilt that made him feel his soul was hurting him physically, so to speak
it all started from her sunken cheeks that i could not think of, or sometimes even look at, without pain, i mean a real physical pain located in my heart
one thing is certain, though—that is the mutual hatred that followed their early friendship
i do not know whether i loved him or hated him, but in my thoughts his shadow dominated my future life and all the plans i had for it
excuse me, prince, you made a mistake—my name is not arkady versilov, but arkady dolgoruky, i rasped unpleasantly, completely forgetting that it was my turn now to bow to the ladies
they had abandoned the card table and nelyudov, the young investigating magistrate, had come dashing in at a gallop from the other room, where he had been with the young ladies, and now wore a most determined and bellicose expression
you’re a dream and you don’t really exist!
for how could you live the rest of your life if you lack the courage to face him now?
i got up from my bed and looked at her questioningly
tell me, kraft, i said suddenly, do you intend to see these people again?
don’t you have a rag or something, so i could wipe it off a bit?
so i had to drag along behind them for a couple of miles on a hot day, and we walked all the way to the institute, where they entered a one-story wooden house, a very respectable-looking one, i must say, as i could see through the window lots of flowers, two canaries, three lap dogs, and some framed engravings
the whole question, my thinker thought, was whether such a time would ever come
i clearly remember us grinning at each other
nevertheless, that's just how it will be, anna, i wo not change my decision
in fact, he was absolutely unpresentable
she may very well feel like becoming a lady just like that, right away
this was, of course, most inconsiderate and rude and probably i ought to have protested
i’m locked in a cell, yes, but i am still alive
who’s going to marry?
by the crown of the tsar,
seeing mitya’s bloodstained face, perkhotin cried in surprise:
oh, she's aware of the passion she inspires in him, she enjoys flirting with him, leading him on, but she wo not marry him!
stepanov just looked at me and shrugged in silence
he’ll accept it tomorrow anyhow
he seems to reject completely the separation of church and state when dealing with the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts
even at this moment, i feel the cold creeping over me as i think of it
of course, that was no way to speak to ladies, or rather to a lady like that because for me mrs prutkov did not count
there's nobody we do not know—they are all friends
if i were poor, i’d kill someone
(i hope the reader wo not be so hypocritical as to pretend he ca not imagine what i mean by disgrace)
i am recording this fact here so that i may remember it as long as i live
perhaps that’s what makes it right now, but only for now
and there was nothing so stupid about it either
i heard everything and i could hardly control myself
my god, he’s dead drunk
so the three of us stood there and waited
he explained to me that this monastic practice is an effective method, evolved in the course of a thousand years of experience, and that it can now be considered a science
in a flash he tore the icon from mrs prutkov's hands and, with a fierce backswing, hurled it against the corner of the tiled fireplace
yes, she suddenly decided to have a bit of fun at their expense—she had not thought of it before, but now she did—and soon she had both of them conquered and lying at her feet
he ca not still be there
the gentlemen burst into loud laughter at karamazov’s surprising statement and one of them even challenged him to back his words with deeds while the others went on elaborating on their horror and disgust, although with extraordinary exhilaration
these past few days he's spoken of nobody but you
it makes me feel very depressed sometimes that, at moments when i feel the need for sincerity, i can never express fully what is on my mind, even to the people the closest to me; there's always something that holds me back, that makes me so mistrustful, uncommunicative, and unfriendly
madam, oh, dear, dear me, the messenger is here!
and if i just whistled, would not thousands of women come rushing to offer me their charms?
as soon as alyosha walked in, the man literally leapt up from his chair and, hurriedly wiping his mouth with a tattered napkin, flew across the room up to alyosha
yes, yes, i remember now—i told her about it all right!
his heart was burning with love for the elder and he reproached himself bitterly for having forgotten about the old man, whom he venerated more than anyone in the world, dying in the monastery while he himself had spent the day in town
only i am not sure whether he's in petersburg right now
i felt confused but not in the least surprised
but he had imagined that it was only a far-off, remote threat, and dmitry karamazov is, above all, a man who lives entirely in the present
is it because he’s stupider than i am and has managed to pour lots of money down the drain with nothing to show for it?
alyosha had other more important things to worry about right then
ivan had not gone fifty yards when, hearing alyosha running after him, he turned back
i’ve learned a great lesson today
i do not understand how someone whose heart and head are completely committed to an idea can live by anything except that idea
i have been always on your side, andrei, and i have always concerned myself with the welfare of those close to you, but now, although the moscow sokolskys are practically strangers to me, i assure you, i feel terribly sorry for them, and i hope you forgive me for saying so
i am sure it would immediately split into two pieces—two, no more and no less
grushenka added in a voice filled with hatred
long ago, speaking of 'the traditions of the russian family, [] pushkin pointed out the legitimate themes for the russian novel, and, i assure you, these traditions are the only things of beauty we have had until now or, perhaps i should say, the only things that have taken on a definite form
i was not in the least sorry for a gentleman who had bought a nickel-plated milk jug thinking it was silver and who had paid five rubles for it instead of the original bid of three
the story is a good one because it reveals so much about a national mentality
so drink some more and that will cheer you up at least
please forgive my explosion, mother, i said with an affected laugh, trying to turn everything into a joke, i was so embarrassed when i realized that nothing could be concealed from mr versilov!
equality lies only in human moral dignity, and this will be understood only in our country
as might have been expected, no sooner had she spoken out than the pressure broke and she was crushed by shame
i am also absolutely convinced that there has never been any lack of such individuals among those who head their movement; possibly even some of the popes themselves were such exceptional individuals
i think you have a wonderful nature, although it’s been corrupted a little
at present he is living in the provinces
but i want you to note this: frantic as he was at that moment, he still snatched up that brass pestle and took it along with him
but there is a bright, wide open road, a straight road, shining like crystal, leading to the sun
ah, i can hardly wait for that damned verdict!
he finally got hold of the bird, tied it to a branch with a piece of string, and, from an inch or so away, blasted at it out of both barrels
you heard him, you heard him, you monks!
and he walked off, this time for good
so i take it you’re coming, alyosha said firmly, seeing her tears
couldn’t dmitry have killed him, then, while you only took the money?
i kept blabbering on like that until we reached the cottage
in general, all my life i have been very slow to take action
as i said before, he simply went around assuming that everyone else was guided by the same motives as he was
and you know what—you can bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walks
i hope no one heard me jump down
well, certainly, if one could help it
he managed to whisper quickly, his speech suddenly no longer faltering
and her guardian angel wept and walked away
but you, with all your learning, you’re no philosopher
relying on the janitor’s promise, fenya had not bothered to lock the cottage door
he shouted, in confusion
then i drew for him as complete a picture as i could of all the useful things a learned man, a doctor, or anyone devoting his life to the service of mankind could, accomplish
it seems i’m hurting you, alyosha, my boy
why, are you late?
but, again, i did not believe he meant what he said, because why should he speak seriously about these things to someone like me?
i’ll decide about it myself
i did not resist
whether it was or not, you would have been convicted anyway, alyosha said with a sigh
and then, suddenly, in the middle of it, he unexpectedly stopped and knitted his brows
if anybody must live, it is him more than us
the stone had been thrown hard and expertly by the boy beyond the canal
but i look at the people here, and no one except me seems to care about it at all!
but we are not equals—you are by very far my superior!
as a matter of fact, she may never understand it, despite the lecture i gave her today
at last the jurors rose, ready to retire
and that was when i started daydreaming about it
shut up, you fake
perhaps because they had got rid of me?
oh, he isn’t the same
what comedy are you talking about?
he would always come in the evening, sit in my room, and chat with me; he also liked to chat with my landlord, which enraged me no end
that was great, great!
god knows why i became excited
i answered her immediately (i couldn’t possibly go to moscow right away)
ah, and what difference could it make now?
my coat is completely unbuttoned, but no one is trying to snatch it off me although there are supposed to be muggers all around haymarket
gregory followed the intruder without ever losing sight of him and, just as the man was pulling himself up onto the fence, gregory reached him, succeeded in catching one of his feet and clutching it with both hands
and so, sofia, do not worry your soul too much because your sin is my sin
fetyukovich did not bother to answer the objections
lately i would started going to zershikov's gambling saloon
dmitry jumped over the prostrate body and pushed the doors open
i would like so much to help him
at last it was time for the defense counsel to cross-examine him, and the first thing fetyukovich wanted to know was about the envelope that allegedly contained three thousand rubles intended for a certain person
i see, however, that it’s not fitting for me to joke with you, gentlemen; that is, not until things are cleared up
they had given him a real shock by suddenly revealing to him his daughter's betrayal and her intention of having him certified insane
she could enter strange houses and no one would chase her away
but i am through now and, as far as i am concerned, you can all drop dead!
well, i had a good reason for that
i am not sure and i do not feel competent to judge whether those two lines are true or not
as to her second appearance on the stand, we all heard her voice shrill with resentment, spite, and hatred
i’ve been here before
they listened to him attentively and took special note of the fact that mitya had, quite some time before, established an observation post at the back of maria kondratiev’s garden, next to his father’s house, from which he reckoned to intercept grushenka
to make a long story short, he said, and it was probably the tenth time he would used that cliche, if i took the liberty of asking lisa to insist that you come here, and despite the fact that it is an emergency, for me the importance of the decision is so tremendous and final that we
he suddenly smiled broadly, although his eyes were still fixed on me
but why do evil?
but have not you been to see him today?
actually i should have known that rakitin would never forget to take good care of himself!
you knew it—i can see from your face that you understood everything right away
i swear to you, by everything i hold sacred, that i sincerely believe what i have just told you about the murder
she did that to distract me, although i always stubbornly pretended i was not in the least interested in the household news
he’s dying of impatience
look here, my good man!
you cannot imagine how important your opinion is to me
shall i tell you what i think his idea is, tatyana?
i didn’t even tell my mother until the wound was completely healed
in a corner by the icons, there was a lectern with a cross and a bible lying on it
i have come to you to ask what you think about all this
it is true that mitya had managed to offend some of these gentlemen since he had come to our town
it really seems very strange, my boy
let us drink new wine, the wine of great, new happiness
there was nobody waiting for you
karamazov protested, but ivan didn’t answer
it was open at the neck, leaving his chest bare
but now if i take this two hundred rubles, i can hire a servant, and you must understand, mr karamazov, that it would make medical treatment for my loved ones possible, that i’d be able to send my learned daughter back to petersburg, that i’d buy us some meat and we’d have a new diet
he cried out emotionally
i know i keep promising again and again to talk about something different only to wind up speaking about nothing but myself once more
i am not sure whether such an accusation is entirely fair
as a matter of fact, what puzzles me no end is how you, alyosha, have managed to remain virgin to this day—you, a karamazov!
i would never seen an expression of such painful shame on her face before
he was immaculately groomed and dressed, but his face made me, at least, think he looked sick; it was grayish, rather like the face of a dying man
i pray god we lose the suit just to get it over with and then live just as we lived before
if i were still in love with him, i don’t suppose i’d be sorry for him
the bottles were brought in and mitya poured out the champagne
somehow—i do not really know why—i have been thinking of that doctor all day and ca not get him out of my mind
now you talk disapprovingly of my weakness for that woman, but it was you yourself who prompted her to lure me!
was it he or the lackey who killed your father?
mrs prutkov, who would already opened the door to go back into the house, quickly turned around, closed the door, and faced me again
she could not refrain from abusing me whenever we met and by now it had become a sort of tradition between the two of us
alyosha quietly opened the door to the elder’s cell, where his coffin now was
tell me yourself, then, why we met here
say, how about a little glass of brandy?
she had obviously put on whatever had happened to be within reach and came out wearing an open dressing gown
was that all he had to say to me?
although alyosha did not answer, rakitin knew by a slight jerk of his body that he had heard him
wait, wait, my boy, just one more little glass
ivan was breathing noisily, glaring angrily at alyosha as if anticipating what he would say
you would better try to deal with lambert
she seemed to be in a paroxysm of sincere self-deprecation and, as she finished, there was a challenge to the elder in her eyes
lambert, however, soon recovered, realized that this was a lucky break for him, that finally he had me there, in his lair, at his mercy!
oh, don’t worry, gentlemen, i make no claim to be treated as an equal under these circumstances
she walked in with her gliding, noiseless step, swaying slightly, as statuesque women sometimes do
i understand he didn’t go in for refinement and that he even had a propensity for suddenly leaping up and using his stick on persons of the female sex
but then, in all fairness, it must be said, she was very, very beautiful and her beauty was that typical russian beauty that inspires passion in so many men
i thank you, i thank you, o god, for the great miracle you have wrought in answer to the prayers of a miserable sinner!
but he also told me much that was true
this had become a habit with him
he only riveted his eyes on ivan’s with infinite hatred
do you remember maria?
there was a man in the land of uz, a righteous and pious man, and he had so much wealth, so many camels, so many sheep, and so many donkeys; his children were happy and he cherished them and prayed for them, in case they sinned as they enjoyed themselves
we must be on our way, he said
mitya watched him from the side without stirring a muscle
i know you’ve done so
it was the woman in her that could not resist tossing these last words at him from the doorway as she was leaving
the russian aristocracy, however, has never resembled its european counterpart: even now after it has lost its special privileges, the russian aristocracy has been able to retain its superior status as the repository of honor, enlightenment, learning, and lofty ideals without becoming, as before, an inaccessible caste, which would have meant the end of the unifying principle
ah, dear god, if only i could collect a little debt that someone owes me as well, there would be enough money even for that too!
we entered noiselessly on the soft carpet and she made me stop by the doorway which separated the little room from the drawing room by a heavy curtain
after kissing her warmly several times on her laughing lips, katerina asked her to sit down in an armchair directly in front of alyosha
i’ll do my best and the reader will see for himself that that is all i can do
the truth is that, the way things stand now, i had to find out what had happened to that unfortunate letter
he imagines things, he's a hypochondriac, tatyana, that's what he is!
i chose the most despicable alternative
i understand you went to see her at her house yesterday
sit down, then, and read this one
just a minute, lambert, the pretty boy said, suddenly becoming so angry that his cheeks became pink, which made him even prettier
but while criminals often justify themselves in this way today, the moment the church superseded the state, they could no longer appease their consciences unless they said: everyone else is wrong; they have all lost god, and their church is a false church
but we shall not repeat it here
nor will i ever forget how that evening ended
he seems sort of muddle-headed too
as a matter of fact i rather like you
i will never forget that heavy fixed stare and yet he was smiling
but blood was still gushing out and mitya’s trembling fingers were immediately splashed by the hot stream
among the simple people there were a few better-class people—two or three ladies and a very old general, all of whom were staying at the nearby inn
and, although he tried not to show his father how unpleasant it was for him, it made him painfully aware of snegirev’s humiliating position in town and always brought back to him that terrible day and then the shouts of back-scrubber
but that’s only a very small point and i don’t even know whether i could really be reproached for it
when she had to go to work as a nanny in the family of an official, she took her little boy to the manager of the mill, who happened to be his godfather
everything comes from god
learn how to know the right measure and recognize the right time
the corner where the bed was was screened off
no, it was i who caused it all while you were guilty only without guilt
and you know why i remained silent?
let’s drink to it, mr pole
but i want you to rest assured, my dear boy, that i am terribly fond of you
remember, once in my house, you smashed the glass you were drinking out of?
only the masses of simple, humble people and their growing spiritual power will be able to convert the atheists, who have been uprooted from our native soil
alyosha had never been able to walk past children indifferently, even back in moscow
oh, i’ll go tomorrow, face them, and spit in their eye!
his sympathy for that unhappy woman had turned into a sort of sacred cause for him so that, even twenty years after her death, he would not let a disparaging remark about her go unchallenged
besides, i may as well tell you that no one has ever really liked me, except perhaps for a certain ensign in my regiment by the name of stepanov, a featherbrained, dull, and altogether unremarkable fellow, whom nobody really respected
it was there then, but today it’s all gone
besides, he did not want to go himself
i despise your opinion and your horror
so what about her?
that's just a habit of mine
we’re making gunpowder ourselves now
alyosha, come over here—sit down, she said, beckoning him with a radiant smile
yes, sir, he’d marry her all right!
and to do it so that you come to love the hated one as well?
and tomorrow i will face my ordeal, but i won’t hang myself
and i’m sure my nikita has taken to drink without me
he may, for instance, suddenly decide that a man must do whatever he is fit for and then repeat again and again a statement like 'i am a prince descended from rurik, but if i am not fit for anything else, there's no reason why i should not become a bootmaker and earn my living that way
but how can he come home to you when you say that you hate your home now?
it made me blush just to think how close i had come, on so many occasions, to blurting out a declaration of my love!
i suppose it would still be possible for some monk or a hermit to make a claim about his relics, but here was a man walking around in his town clothes—and there were all those other things we knew about him—and all of a sudden he starts talking about his relics and sets himself up as a saint!
since she was very attached to her servant, she immediately hired a carriage, drove the girl there, and, moreover, stayed with her to look after her
he was sitting on his bed in his dressing gown
then he will be saved
i’ll ask him, alyosha mumbled
he sounded businesslike again
he knit his brows and clenched his teeth, and his fixed glare became even more fixed and frightening
besides, even if we wanted to describe what was going on inside him, it would be very difficult, because it was not exactly thought but something hard to define, and something extremely troubled
four years ago there was a general in moscow
when asked about the insult he had suffered at mitya’s hands, he refused to answer
we still don’t know, though, who will be in charge of the escort, but, anyway, that’s quite impossible to find out in advance
mitya closed the door behind him
and what about the other one, alyosha?
that day roast beef was served for dinner
i think you should take another sip of water, nelyudov said
your opinion is serious now
in general, he only answered when i asked him something, although he did so quite readily and pleasantly
what’s the matter with you?
he’s just been ruined by his drinking and his disorderly life
i don’t understand really why fenya let you in
he kept intact the original thousand left to each boy by the general’s widow so that, when they came of age, each of them would receive two thousand rubles, thanks to the accumulated interest
you’re right there—the devil must be in on it too
it stretched across the whole wall, that painting, with plenty of blue in it and with that sweet little boy pressing his little fists to his chest, and the little girl, and the hedgehog—the teacher had managed to put everything in
and that german line he quoted—it was so much like you!
i am a high-school graduate and i am nineteen
but a non-russian criminal, i have been told, rarely repents, since many modern theories confirm him in his belief that a crime is not really a crime but only a gesture of protest against an unjust and oppressive force
what are you doing?
or else take me to katerina!
you know, lambert, she has a tremendous admiration for versilov
so that there should be nothing left anywhere
the others, however, did not enter the cell
how could i ever have imagined such audacity on anna's part?
and he had turned so pale!
for two whole hours he felt almost happy and kept sipping his brandy
he was very proud, but in the end he became devoted to me, obeyed me blindly, listened to me as if i were god almighty himself, and even tried to imitate me
he was here but he’s left now’—that’s exactly what they told me
she heard him out with a sad and pained expression
and the most stupid thing was that he liked it so much precisely because there were princes of that name
it’s a nice slav name as i said, and i’ve brought him to meet you
not her either, because you’re not the only one who causes me to suffer, she does too
all i wanted was to utter the word and then judge from his eyes and his facial expression whether he would heard something about these shares
the little pole, beet red with fury but still maintaining his supercilious air, walked slowly toward the door
a merchant, looking somewhat tipsy himself, loudly praised the young man's ability to hold his liquor without showing any signs of drunkenness
and the rest i kept for myself
i have meddled enough with other people's consciences and wound up with nothing but taunts and rebuffs
—because he’s very much afraid to raise his voice
how can he be allowed to get away with it?
i was about to leave dresden, but in my absentmindedness at the railroad station i took the wrong train
our eyes met and i believe i blushed slightly
and, come to think of it, you are her brother, almost her brother, are not you?
and this is very true; what they need is that unnatural combination, and they need it all the time, unceasingly
fearing that, i tried to put off that moment
i sat there and listened and felt as if the whole world were topsyturvy
but to my painful surprise, i found everyone rather tense and worried
and perhaps, remembering this day, you will also think of my words of guidance uttered from the bottom of my heart, because you are still young and the world is full of great temptations beyond your endurance
how could i not have heard?
i remember only too clearly his frozen grin of amazement, verging on disbelief
and that handkerchief soaked in blood
so i’m sitting here and waiting for his messenger
and all the town pleaded with him for a whole month; they be-seeched him and even thought to hold him back by force
so you are justifying that despicable princeling?
she seemed afraid to touch the money
so what kind of monk would i make and how could i claim to have mastered my desires?
and what do you think?
but i wo not allow itl i muttered under my breath, gnashing my teeth
five years later in moscow, although no one told me you were my mother
our little boy must be with the lord now, singing with the angels
it had all been so unexpected that i stood there in complete bewilderment
i was trembling all over
what we like best of all,  he told me, is to have girls sentenced to be flogged and then to flog them
it was a very large room, elegantly and lavishly furnished, not at all the sort of drawing room one would expect to find in a small provincial town
what do you mean by this, my polish friends?
if anyone does not believe me, i can tell him that, when i accepted the money, i was firmly convinced that if i wanted to i could have raised that sum elsewhere
mitya sat down on the bed and started pulling off his socks
why do not you leave then?
well, the end of that tail of his was in the crack of the door and, as i had a sharp eye open, i quickly slammed it shut and caught his tail in it
it’s for him, for my prince charming!
doesn’t that mean that you admit the truth of what i’ve said?
enraged by rakitin’s tone when he spoke of grushenka, mitya suddenly cried out from his place: you bernard!
what makes you think so?
anyway, what are you doing here?
it’s not worth it, because that tear will have remained unatoned for
but i understood, of course, that it’s a philosophical novel and that voltaire wrote it to prove an idea and
here it is, see!
the water in his jug was changed every day
oh, dear, it’s all so wrong!
for now he sees clearly and says to himself: i now have the knowledge and i am yearning for love; but now that my earthly life is over, there can be no self-abnegation, no sacrifice in love, and abraham will not come to me again and bring me even a tiny drop of living water (that is, the gift of life on earth, the active life i possessed before); since i will never again be given life and time, i will never be able to quench the fiery thirst for love that burns in me, because i scorned love while i was on earth
nelyudov prompted him curiously, but mitya did not hear him
he seized her by the shoulder, pointing the gun at her (obviously just for the effect)
this time maxim was really puzzled: it's no use, he's no good
for, in fact, it is not we who are isolated, but they
the nag then makes a desperate effort, pulls the cart out of the mud, and moves forward, its whole body trembling, unable to breathe, walking somehow sideways, skipping in a strange, unnatural, horrible way
i’ve read it myself in the works of their theologians
why won’t he come over and talk to me?
all this is just the opposite of what a citizen should be; it is total isolation—i would even say a deliberately hostile isolation—from society, an attitude that may be summed up thus: let the rest of the world go up in flames as long as i am fine
no, it really had nothing to do with that
actually it took me only one minute to understand you completely
my dear boy, there was nothing i could do
however, i could no longer leave him, even if i would wanted to: i kept drinking and talking, feeling an irresistible need to pour out everything i had in my heart
i felt my blood seething with anger within me and i wanted to play a filthy, piggish trick on her, to treat her the way some vulgar shopkeeper would have under the circumstances
but if he was the murderer and not dmitry, then i am a murderer too
we shall tell them, though, that we are loyal to you and that we rule over them in your name
she, however, rejected that objection, assuring me that she would take care of that and that she had enough money to do so until i graduated
if i sent you to him, alexei, it was because i thought that your face, the face of his brother, could perhaps save him
what do you say?
is, then, this breadth a trait peculiar to the russian that will take him far?
you remember what i was telling you about soundness and unsoundness?
and it doesn’t seem at all likely that katerina, as i know her, could be involved
it is only after a man has recognized his guilt as a son of christ’s society, that is, of the church, that he will become conscious of his guilt toward society, that is, toward the church
he cried worriedly, and then got to his feet and started running, toward the house now
lise cried out, at once becoming very animated
and he can write well, too
i’d say he threw out a good thousand on the gypsies alone
i’m quite afraid to visit respectable people with him
and now he stinks himself, and that is a great sign from god
somehow he got to like markel and received him in his house
and you, have mercy on me!
that's out of the question
first, i want to demonstrate with mathematical certainty that my goal is attainable
of course i did not know then that he was going to shoot himself
kolya said, turning very red
for, as things are now, i don’t dare love my own children, let alone my fellow men
and so this package had been there behind those icons ever since
for the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for
and so good-by for now
the thought that i, who had been able to withstand hunger, could not remain master of myself during such an easy test of will depressed me no end
indeed, i am rather relieved now that it has come out into the open
who is this young gentleman we’re saddled with?
that is, i see some other person and start following her and saying to myself 'it must be her, my olga!
i grabbed my coat and hat and told her to tell lambert that what i would said last night was all nonsense, that i was raving, that i would slandered an honest woman, that i was just joking, and that lambert, if he knew what was good for him, had better stay away from me
thank you very much, grushenka interrupted him with a bow
let me remind you of a brilliant thought expressed here earlier by mr rakitin, a young observer who had observed the karamazov family at very close quarters: the feeling of degradation is as indispensable to these unbridled and unrestrained natures as the sense of supreme nobility
but why, after all, why should not she have heard about it from some other source?
he asked me to
mitya pulled the bundle of money out of his pocket
my suitcase was packed, and all i had to do was make a bundle of the few remaining things that did not fit in
and it was not, by any means, only the uneducated who believed it
he was a good and humane man, who gave his medical services free to the poor, visiting them in their huts and hovels, and even leaving them money to buy the medicines he prescribed
so here's what he did, the landlord said so triumphantly that one would have thought he would done it himself
the doctor declared that ivan was suffering from an extremely critical attack of brain fever and that he ought to be taken home at once
let me tell you, and don’t interrupt me
oh, that is too kind, much too kind, but i am deeply moved and i accept your invitation!
that was the most important to me, and enthusiastically i told him so
well, i’m leaving tomorrow and i was just thinking that i’d like to see you before i went, to say good-by to you, when all of a sudden i saw you walking along
once on his knees, the elder bowed to the ground before dmitry—a deliberate, complete bow so that his forehead actually touched the ground
i had to load them in order to be ready to put a bullet through my brain at dawn
so if i can’t win either way, who can blame me too much for at least trying to keep my hide on my back?
daria grew quite excited as she talked
please leave at once
but wait, did you tell the prosecutor about those signals, those knocks?
he rarely appeared at mass
the food he served, although none too refined, was always plentiful; his meat pies were excellent; and his wine, which was not of a particularly good vintage, made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality
i was pretty sure, though, that you’d be hanging around here today
i want someone to marry me, tear me to pieces, betray me, and then desert me
mrs khokhlakov begged alyosha to report this miraculous prophecy to the father superior and to the monks—for everyone should know about it!
porfiry will take care of me, he said
actually he was a member of some political movement, did some writing, and was even published
and you, dmitry, you’re only too eager to exchange your fiancée for that creature’ and so admit that your fiancée is not worth the creature’s’ little toe even!
it isn’t that i reject god; i am simply returning him most respectfully the ticket that would entitle me to a seat
ah, how stupid can you be!
i’d say he had two or even three thousand rubles
a bright red spot appeared on each of his cheeks
true, he did not actually come from the  amasses,  being fairly well educated and capable of some abstract thinking
believe me, whatever she may say or preach, the life of every woman is a perpetual search for someone to submit to
do not be angry and do not be so proud
and all this was done in great secrecy
why, no, how could he be dangerous?
i have no idea what you’re about to ask me, alyosha said, his cheeks glowing
alyosha suddenly heard his own quivering voice as he raised his right hand as though calling on god as a witness
i have already mentioned that lambert's position was quite shaky at the time
i was struck by the brightness and warmth in that boy’s eyes
watch now: here, perezvon!
that’s not the point now
he did not sit down again but remained standing, listening to her
here i will anticipate even further and say that she did not overestimate the effect produced by the letter; indeed, if anything, it even surpassed her expectations
i rang the bell and the cook opened the door and let me in without saying a word
there's no need for you to go on worrying like this—it's not at all like you, you know
he contented himself with hints, but his hints were not understood
you will know great sorrow and in that sorrow you will find happiness
mother, my own dear blood—he sometimes used the most peculiar endearments—my own dear blood, my sweet joy, know that this is the truth and that every one of us is answerable for everyone else and for everything
once i suddenly became aware that she was doing a pirouette in the middle of the room, but she was not just dancing: her pirouette had a direct connection with her story and she was trying to use it to convey something she was telling me
but he reckoned that a loaded pistol would take care of everything for him
i have just left my wife, he went on
there’s nothing of the sort in the lives of the saints, said the father librarian
see you tomorrow then!
i can no longer remember what they said, but they did tell me something and i stood there listening to them without understanding a word
look, see, they are bringing new vessels in
he became very angry and said rude things about the church
it so happened that in paris i ran into stebelkov, whom i would met before
first, we must get the money and then we will see
but he could no longer make himself open his heart to these men, as he had done earlier, or try to explain to them how he felt about the queen of his heart
just wait a little and there are many things you will find out: you really have no idea of what's going on
your mother tells me she did not know whether she should have accepted the money you offered to pay her for your monthly board
old karamazov shrieked suddenly in a voice that was not his own
i’ll tell you the story behind that money now, and i beg you, i beseech you, to hear me out to the end!
and at the same time my head buzzed with lots of very pleasant thoughts
it’s a lovely picture!
this most elegantly dressed young gentleman was hardly more than twenty, had an extremely pleasant face, a fine complexion, and thick, light-brown hair
don’t keep taunting me about being dressed up, rakitin
but tell me, my dear friend, tell me this: wouldn’t you despise me yourself, mr karamazov, if i accepted this money?
lambert jumped up from the table
grushenka lifted her head from the pillow and looked at alyosha tenderly
you had better be prepared for anything, the doctor said, pronouncing each syllable distinctly
the next day i bring her back the remaining half and say: here, katya, please accept from me, irresponsible scoundrel that i am, these fifteen hundred rubles, for i have spent the other fifteen hundred and i’m afraid i won’t be able to prevent myself from spending this as well
but he emphatically, indeed almost heatedly, attested to smerdyakov’s honesty, and told them about the time when smerdyakov had found some money his master had dropped and had returned it, and how fyodor karamazov had given him a ten-ruble gold piece as a reward and had trusted him completely ever after
what you need is a good beating, that’s what; who do you think you are—going around insulting people, you impudent brat, you?
but it did not arouse my indignation
she, too, came dressed all in black, with her magnificent shawl on her shoulders
why ca not you and why do not you want to?
he’s just like that drunken pig, hollering at the top of his voice, vanya, vanya went to town
that way, boots last on the average one-third again as long
you could not have done that without versilov's explicit permission and i would never have let you without his explicit orders
if anything protects society in our time, if anything can reform the criminal and make a new man out of him, it is only the law of christ, which manifests itself in the awareness of a man’s own conscience
as opposed to a polish woman or a frenchwoman?
so why not, and may the name of our lord be blessed
so the whole point of my idea is that money is the only road that can take a man to the top spot, the only force that can propel him there, even if he's a mediocrity
before her arrival at the courthouse, grushenka had somehow heard that rakitin’s testimony had been highly unfavorable to mitya and she had become furious
as the day was fading, the room was rather dark
but in prison he showed a strange love for children
he stopped her as one would stop a dog
i’ve just been indulging’ a little, as that piggish friend of yours, rakitin, puts it, and will still put it even when he becomes a state councillor
makar's stories also often attracted lukeria, who would emerge out of her kitchen and stand in the doorway listening to him
karamazov leapt up from his seat in a fright
katerina's consumptive stepdaughter fell desperately in love with versilov; perhaps something in him had impressed her violently or maybe his preaching had set her afire, but, whatever it was, at one time versilov spent whole days in the company of the girl
he was even less closely acquainted with the prosecutor, although he had occasionally called on his wife, a temperamental, moody lady with whom he had had very proper chats on those occasions
he made me sit down again
the impact was due mostly to the tone and to the unexpectedness of the conclusions
no one can try to turn me aside from my path without getting hurt
when i was already sitting in the cab, a new idea suddenly came to my mind
all of a sudden a new major arrived in town
smerdyakov never even hinted at the possibility of such complicity, despite the fact that the accused kept insisting that smerdyakov was the real and the sole murderer
and what difference does it make whether hell has a ceiling or not?
i have come here to tell you something
ivan remained silent for a while
o lord, i so hope that my children will understand the price i have paid in suffering for what i have done, and will not condemn me
then, after rakitin had been excused, the presiding judge asked the accused whether he wished to comment on his testimony
take yourself, for instance: you could hardly be accused of a lack of literary culture, although you may still be considered young
and so they dragged in classical languages
what’s come over you!
he felt a violent impulse to hit the little peasant
you know, very fair, with a sharp little nose
although versilov was out, i did not find my mother and sister at home alone, as i had hoped
so you too must know that your child stands before the throne of the lord, rejoicing and happy, and prays to god for you
had you heard the things she was telling us now before?
the first, an elegant barouche drawn by two fine horses, brought peter miusov and a distant relative, peter kalganov
i do not remember
boys, there’s something i’d like to tell you here, by this stone
now i want you to take that, plus another seven hundred rubles to make it one thousand, and i will keep the remaining two thousand
and now i’ll be left all by myself
the public was in great turmoil
does he owe you very much then?
last week, for instance, i tried to ask prince ov what he thought of bismarck because i was very puzzled by bismarck's moves and could not make out on my own what he was after
i’m not angry with my god—i just cannot accept his world, alyosha said with a twisted grin
what stone is that in your ring?
so he stands there while they all discuss what to do— montferrant, those englishmen, and that important dignitary in charge who, having just driven up in a carriage, is listening to them and is beginning to lose his temper because they seem unable to agree
what's the matter, mrs prutkov?
it was a clear, windless day and the temperature was only slightly below freezing
we never stopped talking about makar, and mrs prutkov told many things about him i would never heard before, much of which would be very interesting for its own sake if i retold it here
but there are no hooks there, alyosha said quietly and seriously, looking attentively at his father
i lied to lisa
perkhotin held the jug and kept pouring more water
i just couldn’t control myself
don’t you understand, alexei, this is her way of making you a declaration of love?
no, alyosha, i’m about to tell you something much more interesting
he plans to go on drinking from it until he’s seventy or even eighty; that’s what he says at least, and although he’s a buffoon otherwise, he sounds as if he meant it seriously
as i came in, you were standing in front of a mirror with some sheets of paper in your hand and were declaiming chatsky's closing monologue from woe from wit,[] you know, 'send me my carriage, send it right away!
he kept hugging me with tears rolling down his cheeks
bismarck's idea was at once acclaimed as a stroke of genius and bismarck was hailed as a genius himself, and it's precisely that speed of recognition that makes me suspicious of the idea's true value
i will just give now, without any further comment, the ensuing sequence of events that culminated in the horrible scene
why, when he saw me last i was just a thin, anemic, tearful seventeen-year-old
therefore, if i address myself to the reader now and again, it's only a narrative device
well, after those three years, we’ll know english like genuine english people and, as soon as we do, that will be the end of america!
so now you know
but i realize that, aside from those rumors, you could not possibly have found out anything
let me make it clear that this old prince sokolsky, a very rich man and a privy councilor, was no close relative of the moscow princes sokolsky, members of a branch of the family that had been impoverished for several generations, who were engaged in the lawsuit against versilov
in the old days, serfs employed as house servants used to share many of the interests of their musters, intellectual as well as spiritual
we had four, nikita and i, but we can’t seem to keep them, our little ones, they just won’t stay, dear father, they just won’t
i am not trying to impress you, but i certainly have more character than you have
i was faced with the inescapable choice: to continue my education or to put my idea into practice instead of putting it off for another four years
it is both possible and necessary!
she suddenly frowned and turned again toward the doctor
judging by the vehemence with which you deny my existence, it would seem that, despite everything, you still believe in me, the gentleman said laughingly
i do not know why, but i need it
you’re a holy little fool!
yes, that is what everyone must feel deep down, instinctively as it were
actually i was surprised rather than offended, for i did not yet know what being offended was
but all of a sudden lise burst out laughing at my words, and she laughed so insultingly, it was quite terrible
i believe the presiding judge at once communicated this new piece of evidence to the associate judges, to the prosecutor and the defense counsel, and then to the jurors
you know, my boy, he said, as if pursuing a thought that had been interrupted, there's a limit to how long a man is remembered on this earth
i have brought up this conversation about vasin's neighbors here because of what was to follow and i must note that, while we were talking about them, we could not hear a sound coming from their room
as i would expected, lambert had been around and had recently returned twice
or shall we put him on the box with the coachman?
he may be a chicken to you, rakitin, but that’s only because you’re a man without a conscience—that’s what
vasin then recited entire lines such as i have chills and i thought of drinking a glass of brandy to warm myself up but i would better not as it might intensify the bleeding
pan wrublewski walked with a rolling gait to the table and took the glass mitya was holding out to him
i remember many things
soyez tranquille, je feral voir raison a lambert!
russia is just a nasty mess
olga, but perhaps it is not even true, perhaps this is not his son
for even a priest who is short of time and overburdened with work and church services can still snatch at least an hour a week to remember god
i walked over to him and he put his hands on my shoulders
mr karamazov asked as he walked up the front steps
no, no, nothing of the sort
now i’ve noticed that you, mr ivan, have been going up to your room pretty early these days, and yesterday you never left your room at all
yet the more they respected him, the more painful it was for him
i suffer from my lack of faith
they searched all along the garden fence with lanterns and finally found the brass pestle lying quite conspicuously on the gravel path
he looked triumphant again, as though he had caught me most astutely and exposed me for something shameful
katerina's face had turned very red
he almost whispered these last words and lowered his eyes
she said, turning quickly to perkhotin
i have it and i’ll read it to you
of course, i do not give a damn about taunts and rebuffs, but what's important is that such interfering never gets you anywhere: no one will listen to you, however hard you try, and they will only end by disliking you
later that evening, my client pounded the upper part of his chest—where the bag with the bills was hanging—in the presence of his brother, swearing to him that he still had the means to save himself from being a despicable blackguard, but admitting that he would remain a blackguard, because he lacked the strength and determination to use that means
but from there you could have gone three different ways and i might have missed you
and although no one in the whole world knows it, every night i lie there in the dark and gnash my teeth and cry with rage, just as i did five years ago, when i was just a girl, and i still keep repeating: i’ll show him, i’ll show him, for what he did to me!
in one corner there were several icons, in front of which a lamp was lighted every night, not for religious reasons so much as to light the room
still, i hate darkness, i love sun
i assure you it was much better for you that way
why i needed it?
a discordant note could be detected in the general mood now
as for the rest, it is still shrouded in darkness, although there are those who are only too anxious to tell all sorts of stories about me
kostya stared at his sister
so that’s the explanation: what happened to your brother dmitry was just this temporary insanity
and now, good-by, my dear, good-by, beloved people
but between one orgy and the next, he would drive all over the province complaining tearfully to all and sundry of adelaida’s desertion, and revealing on these occasions certain unsavory intimate details of their conjugal life that any other husband would have been ashamed to mention
it is extremely important for him
say, let me have a look at it
now, alyosha, tell me this: is it true that jews steal christian children and slaughter them on passover?
in the meantime lent had begun, but markel refused to fast
it’s different with other people, but we callow youths, we have first of all to settle the eternal verities that worry us
he acted honorably, alyosha said quietly
but what a dirty blow that was!
the monks rose, greeted him with bows so deep that their fingers touched the floor, and went up to him, to kiss his hand and receive his blessing
he was walking slowly and it looked as if, early as it was, he already had a few drinks in him
you go ahead, rakitin—finish the whole bottle
what it was the reader will learn at great length in good time
and wearing that cassock, too!
makar, seeing that everybody around him was horrified by something, became frightened too
in short, there's something
i admit now that i should have gone to see him when he first got sick and forgiven him
later, she heard the merchant was in money again
the two youngest daughters, who went to church in blue and green dresses fashionably tight-fitting with three-foot trains, got up at dawn on ordinary mornings and, arming themselves with twig brooms, swept out the rooms of the guest house and emptied the slops left by the travelers who had spent the night
but anna was in no way in the position of a young ward in the house of a rich and aristocratic lady, as often described in literature, like the young protegee of the old countess in pushkin's queen of spades, for instance
but in the meantime we would like you to remove your socks too
i saw at once how much he had changed
the vulgar ones would be after money, while the more imaginative ones would be attracted to the strange, proud, and distant man, so inscrutable and detached
first learn to address me properly!
so we sat there, both of us, for perhaps two whole minutes, he looking at me fixedly all the time
but i wanted very much to cheer him up
roulette is prohibited by police regulation
i adore you, mitya muttered breathlessly
my dear friend, if you can manage it, get me out of here!
let us not presume to correct, from this platform of justice and sanity, the precepts given us in the gospels by our lord, to whom the counsel condescendingly refers as the crucified humanitarian,  whereas to our russian orthodox church he is the lord, our god’!
i bet he lost his job and learned somehow that grushenka had money and that that’s behind this miraculous return
at that moment, you could not find a single european in the whole of europe!
miusov at first went about the matter with some zest, and was even appointed mitya’s guardian (jointly with karamazov), since the boy had, after all, the small estate and the town house coming to him as his inheritance from his mother
the captain suddenly turned toward alyosha as though he were about to attack him
so what was the point of staying alive?
i mumbled that i would been thrown out of the old prince's house and that bjoring had shoved me in the street
besides, he did not have a tie and he needed one
what could i make out of that?
it was you who murdered him
we have at least as many holy fathers as they do
the uncouth brutal german soldier was showing under the disguise of the society man
suddenly there's not a single one left
he started, but she interrupted him
that evening had momentous consequences
besides, the three horses were steadily eradicating the distance that separated him from his immediate goal and, as he came closer to it, the thought of her, of her alone, gripped him more and more strongly, displacing the horrible ghosts that peopled his mind
there is hardly any need for me to say that i felt as though i were floating on a cloud
and just from all that worry, the spasm seized me by the throat and i went flying through the air
the three thousand
father paisii was, of course, quite right in anticipating that the sweet boy would come back, and he may even have guessed fairly accurately (although not entirely) the true nature of alyosha’s inner feelings
he said this with great sadness, but i was not sure whether he was being sincere or putting it on
mitya finally accepted their explanations, stopped protesting, and gloomily began to dress
but he studied me like that for only a few seconds and then a very slight mocking grin twisted his lips, whereupon he slowly turned away and walked back into the inner rooms just as lightly and smoothly as he would come
he was interested in it as a social manifestation and was anxious to classify the accused and his outlook as the product of his social background, as a typically russian phenomenon, etc, etc
she might, for instance, say to him without any preamble: take me, i’m yours forever
father joseph walked away from them filled with a sadness that was the greater because he felt he had not defended his views strongly enough, as if he himself had not been entirely convinced of what he had said
where was providence, then, and its guiding finger?
i shall even be happy now, and i beg you to tell her that
tell me, alyosha, did he?
when he entered, alyosha went to a corner, knelt down, and began to pray
i really don’t know why i felt like laughing
for at least half an hour, i kept droning on like that in a monotonous little voice with my eyes modestly cast down
once, quite long ago, on a warm september night, when there was a full moon and it was late by our provincial standards, half a dozen of our gentlemen, who had left the club in a rather inebriated state, were making their way home through the back gardens
it must be noted here that, although dr herzenstube spoke russian with zest and volubility, his sentences somehow made one think of german sentences
but that was only one episode among many
the peasant, for his part, kept throwing sly glances at mitya, appearing irritatingly unperturbed, even contemptuously insolent—or at least so it seemed to mitya
i am sure that if stebelkov and i had not been present, sergei would have been more dignified and resourceful
if you do not know how to act in this case yourself, how can i possibly advise you?
tell me, you don’t think father zosima will last until tomorrow?
no, there are too many of them, he said, putting the clipping back in his pocket
was it a fable or was it a passage from woe from wit?
i checked by wiring to moscow to find out whether the money had been received
the other one laughed and sang to me
i really must go and report you
the train stopped at about three in the afternoon at a station
why did he have to prostrate himself like that?
since the morning i saw you last, i have taken a step that not everybody would understand as well as you, with your uncontaminated mind and loving, uncorrupted heart
oh, we don’t mind at all
he shouted at the long-legged one
but the accused’s mania manifested itself most clearly, according to the doctor, in the fact that he was unable to speak about the three thousand rubles of which he considered he had been cheated without an anger and emotion that were out of all proportion, whereas he could dwell calmly on his other failures and frustrations
his heart must know why!
i’m a bit sad, though, that such a naturally charming boy as you, who hasn’t even begun to live, should already be corrupted by all this wicked nonsense
i will never come here again when you are around!
i know that, for two whole years now, they have been watching the maneuverings of his greedy and callous daughter
but ivan, who had silently taken his seat, suddenly swung around, put his hands on maximov’s chest, and shoved him so violently that he landed a good three yards away, only by miracle remaining on his feet
if i were a talented russian writer, i would pick my characters from the hereditary gentry because only among that species of educated russians can be found at least a semblance of harmonious order that could be used to produce an aesthetic effect of beauty so essential in a novel
good-by, mr karamazov, dear fellow, good-by!
as to sergei, it was as though he had not even seen me
and what about the vow i made to myself and to my forefathers to reform and to atone for my unspeakable past?
he had the inn-keeper recalled to the stand and, despite the man’s obvious ill-will, made him testify to pan wrublewski’s substituting a deck of marked cards for the one trifon had given him and pan musijalowicz’s cheating when dealing
but once every three years or so he would turn up in town and come directly to my mother's and spend some time with her, for it so happened that she always had a place of her own separate from versilov
i heard you were planning to go out tomorrow
i did mention his name several times while i was delirious, but once i would come out of my delirium, i became convinced that everything connected with lambert had remained a secret and that no one, not even versilov, knew anything about him
gregory was so overwhelmed that he did not speak one word until the christening, spending most of his time out of the house, away from everybody
obviously i could not guess myself what it was all about, so t decided to attend quickly to my business with stebelkov and then to go and see the old prince where i felt instinctively i would find the answer to the new riddle
however, katerina was quite intransigent on that point
as for me, i just got up and walked out on her once and for all
but instead, to his amazement, his lips started shaping completely different words
i immediately took out the money, paid for it, and retired to a corner of the room
a woman, who wore a cheap calico dress but who looked as if she might be a lady, sat on a chair by the bed on alyosha’s left
the thunderous shout of rapture of the seraphim
why should i always be expected to make the first move?
often it is the one who gets the upper hand who feels embarrassed, precisely for getting the advantage
ten minutes went by and suddenly, in the very middle of one of stebelkov's resounding broadsides of laughter, someone jumped up heavily from a chair, two female voices started shouting at the same time, and stebelkov obviously got up from his seat too and spoke in a completely different tone, pleading to be allowed to explain something
as to gorstkin, he looks like a peasant, goes around dressed in a peasant’s blue coat, but really he’s a downright fraud and that’s where we’re bound to have a lot of trouble, especially with his lies
it was obvious that his good reputation had preceded him
but i will get back to that later
i shall be calm
a lot of money, bills of high denomination—a wad of hundred-ruble bills
how would that be possible now?
it was all confined to the document—i actually told versilov only about what concerned that document
but he answered his own question by entering the house
it’s not worth one single tear of the martyred little girl who beat her breast with her tiny fist, shedding her innocent tears and praying to sweet jesus’ to rescue her in the stinking outhouse
but kolya was much too worried to stay and play with them
i had to find myself another place to five, move there, and also do a few other things i had decided must be done
i did that because i felt i was in a tight spot and needed time to grasp the situation
look at the way he’s walking up and down, grushenka said, looking at him scornfully
what revelations had i expected from him?
i’m afraid you don’t know me very well, she said threateningly
all these details came out later and were thoroughly documented, but for now we shall confine ourselves to the essential events of these two nightmarish days that preceded the horrible catastrophe that was suddenly to engulf him
when he was at last excused, kalganov walked away in unconcealed indignation
i really don’t think so, madam
i hear that they have stopped flogging in europe altogether, whether because their habits have become milder or because they’ve passed new laws forbidding it, so that a man no longer dares to beat another, i don’t know
he feels sorry for me, ha!
so when you come in, you’d better not even look at me for a while—look at mother or out of the window instead
but that lasted only a few moments, and then there was a general commotion
you see, that is really not our line of business at all, the old man said very slowly
i would not even have to jump into the yard
but enough of that, because, as i suppose you imagine, i didn’t call you in here just to tell you all this nonsense
but i guess i’ve talked myself dry and my words have lost much of their meaning
but i must remind you that, here too, you are faced with a matter of life and death for a man!
he smiled as he said it, but his face was pale as chalk
very true, father paisii, a learned and taciturn monk, assented in a tense, decisive tone
oh, you knew very well at that moment that if you had made the slightest move to jump, you would have tempted god, proving you had lost your faith in him, and you would have been smashed against the earth that you had come to save, and would thus have gladdened the wise spirit who was tempting you
indeed, he was in no state to stand and observe
i have nothing but happy memories of my mother’s home
i decided to get straight to the point, feeling the pressure of her exaggerated warmth, although not altogether unpleasantly
but later i often remembered with tears in my eyes how he had asked me to live for him
what’s going on, gentlemen?
i felt someone seize me by the elbow
but the hell with it
did you notice just now how kind grushenka was and what respect she showed for my loss?
of those three minutes i only remember the presence of an absolutely beautiful woman, whom the old prince hugged and kissed while making the sign of the cross over her, and who, almost from the moment she entered, quickly looked around the room and then fixed her eyes on me
this will be the spirit of the new era and people will look back in amazement at the past, when they sat in darkness and refused to see the light
the voice was familiar
now, the monastic life is quite a different matter
they’ve finished their tea and the official has ordered some liqueurs
she covered her eyes with her other hand and it was obvious that she was very ashamed of making this confession
go and sit in the corner and wait there like the flunkey you are!
she had listened with still flickering hope to grushenka’s words about the possibility of doing everything to please her one day, like a slave; she looked intently into grushenka’s eyes and saw in them still the same cheerful, innocent trustfulness as before
martha answered these bitter, albeit justified, reproaches by pointing out that the hen had been an old hen and that she herself was not a trained chef like smerdyakov
a few most inappropriate things, i dare say
but the examining magistrate politely suggested that mitya stick to the point
the other room across the passage was empty: the forester had left
and this time, i mean what i say seriously
i alleged family reasons
lise was tremendously moved by the story
well, in that case
what a funny brat, a woman said
juicy morsels do not tempt me
i want you to understand that i’m telling you something that i was told myself, just a legend
so she’s not angry with me for being jealous!
two minutes passed in that way
well, it's not that bad really—they did not sentence her to hard labor in siberia, so do not take it so hard
they’re not yet guilty of anything
i wonder what our good peasants will say now?
that rather annoyed me
dmitry interrupted her, somehow beginning to worry again, i may
this is something about which you were right
i gave her a look that i thought was close enough and saw nothing particularly interesting: she was not very tall, rather plump, and her cheeks were a very bright red
his hair was fair; his light gray eyes were large; his face seemed very open, although i felt that there was also something needlessly hard about it
i can do it from right here
it still would not necessarily follow that he had killed his father
you may be right
you’re still too young to know everything that grown-ups know, but i’ll be back and i’ll tell you as much of it as possible
listen, if there’s something you’d like to talk to me about, he said suddenly, please change the subject
that’s just it, my boy
if he hadn’t been so drunk, he wouldn’t have written it!
and even if every one of those fellows was the greatest of engineers or the greatest anything, i still say the hell with them, they aren’t my kind of people, and i don’t want to have anything to do with them
ah, if there was a way to relive that period, how differently i would behave!
at kraft's—you know, the man who shot himself
as to my present trouble with the police and the possible consequences when i would have to answer the charges, i simply forgot to think about that
i suffer, forgive me, i suffer
they had no proof whatever, the officer knew it, and they did not even insist they had
yes, that’s all, and i always suspected as much!
three or four years after his second wife’s death, he had gone to the south of russia, ending up in odessa where he stayed for several years
i simply wanted to crush the bouquet because it was beautiful
i see, so you were planning to blackmail me later, too, for the rest of my life, ivan growled through his teeth
for the great concern of these miserable creatures is not that every individual should find something to worship that he personally considers worthy of worship, but that they should find something in which they can all believe and which they can all worship in common; it is essential that it should be in common
why, must you have that too?
but didn’t he despise me and laugh at me?
and there's another reason that proves she loves you; i will tell you all about it when you come home with me, and then you will know that it's true
oh, i’d be happy to die if i could live for one single year without knowing about that blood
i can tell you this for certain, grushenka, alyosha said, getting up
we were not allowed long together anyway, for his wife kept looking in every minute
something happened within alyosha and, looking at all those bright young faces around him, he said:
if dogs could reason and criticize, i’m sure they’d find as much or even more to laugh at in the social relations of their human masters
a square wooden peasant table had been moved out of that corner and was now under the middle window
well, it is true, gentlemen, so let them get out of the way, either with or without awe, but in my humble opinion the great writer finished his novel in that way, either in a fit of childish sentimentality or simply to placate the censors of his time, for, if his own heroes sobakevich, nozdrev, and chichikov had been harnessed to his troika, such horses would not get anywhere, whoever held the reins!
i wish i had counted it
and what a beautiful race of men lived here!
i even wanted
later i heard about some of these
in the evening he felt ill and sent for a doctor
alyosha decided to wait as long as necessary
when suddenly i realized i was crying, i became frightfully embarrassed
would he be running after you too by any chance?
doctors came and fussed about,
the poor thing told me with a strange bewilderment, helplessly shaking her head, how she had spent six whole months there alone with her tiny daughter, without speaking the language, feeling like a babe in the woods, and how in the end she had even run out of money
they drive there together
that disproportionate amount of profit involved no risk since i could tell from the eyes of the customer that he would not back out
yes, stop at father’s before you go to see her and ask him for the three thousand
i’ll go, father, i’ll do as you say
let’s talk about important things: have you had anything to eat today?
alyosha never felt the least surprise that all these people should love the elder, that they should prostrate themselves before him, weeping with emotion at the mere sight of his face
there's a sacred truth in those two lines!
i walked quickly out of the yard
do you repent it now?
but he won’t leave town
i quickly stepped back into the study, closing the door behind me, unnoticed by sergei, who came in through the other door
but now, enough talking, for it’s time to go to the funeral repast
forget all of them and let's get out of here
those who had known him before found him terribly aged, although he was still by no means an old man
it was a beautiful night, brisk, just below freezing
after he woke up, it took him a long time to understand where he was and what was happening
i will not really attempt to explain
but, noticing the open doors of the other rooms, she quickly closed hers, leaving just a crack through which she listened until olga's steps could no longer be heard
what are we going to do now?
no, i do not find that acceptable, alyosha said and his eyes suddenly flared up
as is well known, there is tremendous diversity in tastes, and perkhotin thought pleasantly, she’s not at all middle-aged really!
the prosecutor, on the other hand, was exultant
as i was hurrying here
ah, ilyusha, my darling, you’re a nice, nice boy who really loves his mamma!
there are no moral ideas now, none at all
he even slept with it
no, thank god, you are not godless
and alyosha had been certain that she really was as he saw her and that he had not exaggerated these traits in her
both letters were sent off the next morning
yes, alyosha thought, his head already on the pillow, with smerdyakov dead, ivan’s testimony will not be believed; nevertheless he’ll go and testify!
please try instead to understand us, in our position
how could she even imagine that you are in love with mrs akhmakov!
could not you manage somehow to hide his filthy shirt?
i tell you once more that man has no more pressing, agonizing need than the need to find someone to whom he can hand over as quickly as possible the gift of freedom with which the poor wretch comes into the world
no, she won’t come today
she let me
but you do not have any at all!
well, that’s how it is, brother!
with the great concept of immortality gone, they have to replace it with something, and the immense reserves of love that before were lavished on him who was immortality are now directed toward nature, the world, fellow men, every blade of grass
no, wait, it wasn’t karl
mitya cried enthusiastically (he was still in the same exhilarated state) and ran back home
if i could have, i’d have left town just to get away from him
no, no, it ca not be
did something happen to you at anna's?
nonsense, utter nonsense
he looked calm, almost majestic
let me anticipate here and say that it was precisely this ambivalence about my plans and my goals, all of which took shape in moscow and remained with me in petersburg (for i do not know whether a day passed without my setting a final limit when i would break off my relations with them and leave), this ambivalence, as i was saying, that was probably one of the main reasons for the indiscretions, villainies, nastiness, and, of course, blunders i have been guilty of during the past year
it was also a photograph, a much smaller one, in a narrow wooden oval frame
alyosha crossed the bridge and climbed uphill along the fence, straight toward the ostracized boy
because he was paid not in shares but in hard cash
but i will be satisfied because i will have broken her!
she had sold her house and now lived with her mother in an old, ramshackle cottage
ah, the hell with you!
it is possible, though, that lambert did not even bother to be that subtle
i was not drunk last night, it was not the wine
but now, fifteen centuries later, we can see that in those questions everything was perfectly foreseen and predicted and has proved so true that there is nothing we can add or subtract anymore
he also knows that his father has an envelope in the house with three thousand rubles in it, which he sealed with three seals, tied with a ribbon, and addressed in his own hand to my darling grushenka if she comes to me,  to which, three days later, he added, to my little chick
that was all, however, and he never touched her again
the fact that i hated women helped too
i’ll pray for you today
so i’m off to the priest’s now!
after stebelkov had left, he was about to sit down, but he glanced at me and changed his mind
this was a crucial problem for our monastery because it had not previously been renowned for anything in particular: it had no saints’ relics, no miracle-working icons, nor even any glorious traditions connected with the history of russia
i’ll find out about it, break in, and stop them
you would oblige me very much if you would consent to talk to me
i’m through with the past now, through with it once and for all, and i don’t want to hear of it ever again, not a word, not an echo
you mean with katerina earlier today?
perhaps, when alone with their consciences, they may ask themselves: what does honor really mean?
and how much time was there left to you before he married her?
you will shed a mother’s tears for a long time to come, but in the end your weeping will turn into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will become tears of quiet tenderness which will cleanse your heart of sin
but i see it differently
the circumstances of her birth have never bothered me for a moment, he said
she would said that about sergei, who was then lying unconscious in the prison hospital
this is what happens at least in lutheran countries, i believe
please, inspector, this is most improper, absolutely improper!
you say i am in a hurry?
i must make sure, though, whether i really did incite him
she's out of town, in our country house, although it's been sold now and we own nothing there really
believe me, that is what i like most about being on earth—the fact that it makes me superstitious
he also listened very attentively when i told him about my meeting with stebelkov
he would stop again and again, as if trying to work something out, then look fixedly at me, apparently trying to remember a matter that had some connection with me
you don’t say—so it was even alcohol!
from that look the boy understood that alyosha had no intention of attacking him; he dropped his defiant attitude and spoke first:
but the minute he gets out of it, he no longer knows what he is
but they hide it, they lie, they pretend
i’m so incredibly curious to know!
i’ve been longing to see you all this time, zinovy
suddenly the picture of his other brother, dmitry, flashed through his head
some may cry out in indignation at what i have just said and say that i am a sick and hysterical person, that i am exaggerating monstrously, slandering our people, and raving
would not a passionate italian woman be good enough to attract a civilized and upper-class russian like versilov?
why is he so nasty?
but, of course, i never told her how i felt
you know, there’s a lot of rheumatism going around
you see, alyosha dear, she said, suddenly looking very playful, as a mysterious little smile appeared on her lips, you see, i suspect, alyosha, and i’m telling you this as if i were your mother
i don’t know how to express it, but a person to whom such questions occur is himself capable of suffering
i raised my hand to hit him, but he quickly got up and told me to remember that i was his accomplice and therefore just as much of a crook as he himself
the old man was absolutely delighted now
yes, it was stupid and awful because i often took it upon myself to reassure him, offer him advice, and i would even smile condescendingly at his propensity to lose his temper over what i called such trifles!
his state of mind at that moment could be described as follows: since it was not in his power to regain their respect, why shouldn’t he go on and disgrace himself altogether, to show them that he could not care less what they thought of him?
he’s jealous while he eats, while he sleeps, all the time
she had received two letters from him at first, but now there had been no word from him for over a year
and it’s all completely natural
are you or are you not going to fire the shot to which you are entitled, sir?
as to the mattress his father had mentioned, he had long since forgotten about it and had not bothered to put it on the hard sofa
furious, bjoring again turned to the lackey and loudly shouted one or two words to him that i could not make out
they’re all dried up inside
i am sure sofia alone could have overcome the poor girl's suspicions and she would be alive now
i thought they were going to start a riot
i have the right to tell you about the humiliation he inflicted on her, indeed, it is my duty to do so, because, when she learned about what he had done to you and about your difficult circumstances, she asked me today, just an hour or so ago in fact, to
what could possibly have caused it?
he had it placed on the poor crazy woman’s grave at his own expense after mr karamazov, whom he had repeatedly plagued about it, finally left for odessa without doing anything, turning his back not only on his wife’s grave but on all his memories as well
so he’s expecting grushenka even today?
well, you understand what it meant when he said he did not want to see it again?
as he was stepping out of the carriage, the boy came running up from the side, stumbled against the step by the entrance door, slipped, and while falling stretched both hands out in front of him
then, suddenly addressing smerdyakov directly, he said: you aren’t a human being—you’re made of the slime of the bath-house—that’s what you are
nevertheless, i ca not see how else versilov could have started with my mother, even if he had wanted to
yes, and it was not always too clear what he was trying to say
mitya fell silent too
but it’s so terribly important, don’t you see?
i will never forget those first moments in europe
alyosha was looking at her sadly puzzled, when he suddenly felt a letter in his hand
the unexplainable and distasteful news about lambert and his intrigues did not fill me with terror as might have been expected, judging from the almost irrational horror with which, during my sickness and convalescence, i remembered our last meeting
the doctor had on his bearskin coat again, with his sealskin cap on his head
yes, that’s just what i was expecting to happen—it’s the truth!
i only wanted to tell you something, just a couple of words
there's art that is the poetry of life, there's the joy of helping those in need, and then there's her—the biblical beauty!
my name is alexei karamazov, alyosha said in answer to his question, but the man interrupted him at once
tell me, alyosha said, are you sure it was you who asked him to come here?
and then it will be really terrible!
makar's letters were received exactly twice a year, not more often nor less, and all his letters bore a striking resemblance to one another
what makes you think that you know so much about these things?
i leaped up from my chair
that's quite a question you are asking me
mr karamazov usually went to bed late—at three or four in the morning—and until then he would pace the room or sit in an armchair and meditate
and let me tell you that anna has a very high opinion of you
that is my sincere opinion and i hope i never change it, kolya concluded challengingly
tell me, then, how did you get there?
he looks down with compassion, his lips form the words talitha cumi’—arise, maiden—and the maiden arises
she must have sent you a note or something
i have one more thing to tell, i must tell it, i must!
what would it have cost him to add to that note the words, i am the murderer, not karamazov
drunk in spirit,  he said
what came over you yesterday?
there was nothing left of his familiarity and his faintly arrogant air
i like her for that!
she’s decided to follow your brother dmitry to siberia, while your other brother, ivan, will follow her and live in some town not too far away, and so they’ll go on tormenting one another
you know, i would have never thought of it myself
i would never been to an auction before, i would never allowed myself to go to one
i tell you once more that you persist in being irrelevant; indeed, i believe you are being deliberately irrelevant
alyosha was greatly surprised
but then he changes his statement: he is not sure, he now thinks he used an old bonnet of his landlady’s rather than a piece torn off his own shirt
hm  of course, a conversation like that could have taken place between them and must have preceded by an hour or so a certain other conversation
it only said: to ivan fyodorovich karamazov
she’ll leave now
or hates her with such a passion?
thus, when she once told him how much she appreciated his kindness toward me and his willingness to talk to me as an equal when he was by far my intellectual superior (that is, she repeated to him just what i would said to her), his answer took her aback:
have you ever thought of gold mines, mr karamazov?
but i would also like to tell that reader that he knows nothing either, and i will prove it to him
it all seems very plain to me, i said; your peter valerianovich is eating his rice and raisins in his monastery and bowing to the ground while he does not really believe in god
after all, when he was in the cell no one had knelt and confessed aloud, so he could not have seen anything of the sort and was just repeating old gossip that he somehow remembered
oh, in these instances, a criminal often becomes very credulous and thoughtless
during our wanderings, this dear, silent man would buy gingerbread and candy with the coppers he received as alms, and give them to the children we came across, for he could not pass a child without his heart trembling with tenderness—that is the sort of man he is
whenever you hear of that sin, pray hard for the sinner, at least sigh for him as you turn to god, even if you never knew him—that will make your prayer all the more effective
please go to the door, open it a little, and see if mother isn’t eavesdropping, lise suddenly whispered nervously
i sewed it myself
and all of a sudden i understood something of what was being read in the house of god
nor is it from me, his brother, or from anyone but her, her alone
she will accept me, plainly and abjectly
the only way perhaps to change one's laugh would be by re-educating oneself, by becoming a better person, by developing the better instincts in one's nature and overcoming the worse: such a person would probably then have a more beautiful laugh
they excused him very quickly, and then it was grushenka’s turn
in my piece, he comes on the scene, although he doesn’t say a word; he just appears and vanishes again
but there's nothing perfect in her at all, he said, apparently surprised at my evaluation
why do you call it a pipe dream, prince?
all right, although there are many things i knew nothing about, i suppose too many things
if there’s no god and no life beyond the grave, doesn’t that mean that men will be allowed to do whatever they want?
he had been in moscow from time immemorial and had taught french ever since his arrival among us
perkhotin cried, suddenly sick of it all
great sadness, bottomless and total, flooded his face
i will give a few excerpts from that letter here, for i believe they express nikolai's general opinion of the situation and may perhaps shed some light on my story too:
nothing, madam, absolutely nothing, i’m sorry to say!
actually, she only said very few words but it was  it was the most beautiful poem i ever heard
when, in the morning before i left for my job, my mother gave me coffee that was not hot enough, i grew angry and was rude to her, although i was the same man who would gone a whole month only on bread and water
no, i’ve never given a thought to gold mines
he bowed once more to the elder, and then, turning abruptly toward his father, unexpectedly bowed to him just as deeply and respectfully
that's a good idea, the old man said and hastily reached for the crutch
indeed, i’m certain she did foresee it but decided to go ahead anyway!
i confess i am quite fascinated with that sort of reasoning, but then perhaps it was all just an aberration on his part, an act prompted by that double of his, as you put it so well just now
well, why shouldn’t he smoke that pipe of his if he enjoys it?
but then i would often seen a certain childlike playfulness in her on other occasions too
there's something absurd in her question
on the other hand, although she foresaw a possible impulse on my part to give the letter back to katerina, she felt sure i would do that only under a very special circumstance
the only trouble is that i ca not help worrying: as soon as i am alone, i worry
i wo not allow myself, of course, to criticize you, although every page raises questions
in general, though, you’re much more amiable with me than you were last time and i know very well why: it’s because of that great resolution of yours
i’m sorry, sir, but i don’t go in for that sort of business
he was assassinated outside a paris theater on february ,
won’t your parents give you a good whipping for coming out with me?
he did it very circumstantially and thoroughly
why should i bother my head about what will happen to your mankind a thousand years from now if, according to your own theory, in any case i cannot be rewarded with love, future life, or even gratitude for my services?
mitya was in a state of unimaginable agitation
however, he seemed to despise women as much as he despised men and was cool and distant with them
ah, my sweet little boy, my own little darling!
i like people with such strong beliefs, even if they happen to be just young boys like you
he awoke very late in the morning—nine o’clock or so
he’s convinced that i’m the murderer, i can see that
you know, the way monks do—the systematic practice whereby they gradually learn to control their will
joy fills with light the plants’ green faces,
since you are laughing and waving your hands, i suppose i must have guessed wrong
the others order him about, tease him, treat him like a flunkey
but how did i know that smerdyakov had hanged himself?
otherwise he was a man of crass ignorance
i have a rather strange trait: i can hate locales and objects just as i hate people
and now it turns out that you’re on your way to see her and father
he was, of course, referring to the door that you insist was closed all the time that you were in the garden
that treatment is a very curious one: it’s an infusion of certain herbs that martha prepares according to some secret recipe
now they are planning to spend the summer somewhere in the countryside outside petersburg
and, of course, i could never have imagined that he would ask me to kiss him
if i demand that they throw you out now, they will do it
as you wish, mitya said gloomily
that's what i would answer if you asked me about mr versilov
i had not seen her arrive
just imagine, i have been looking for you at your place and elsewhere, wondering where i could get hold of you—you are the one person i wanted to see in the whole world!
well, here we are
he has plenty of brains
kolya sat down on the bed at ilyusha’s feet
master’s curiosity was hot:
we must live according to the laws of nature and of truth, mrs dergachev said from the doorway
why it made me so furious i couldn’t explain to you, because i don’t know myself
and another thing i’ve come to like down here is taking care of my precious health
one more word and i’ll have you removed!
i was thinking of the gold mines
i swear to god she didn’t!
i wo not be alone, i kept ruminating, darting back and forth like one possessed during those last days in moscow
but i predict that at the very moment when you see despairingly that, despite all your efforts, you have not only failed to come closer to your goal but, indeed, seem even farther from it than ever—at that very moment, you will have achieved your goal and will recognize the miraculous power of our lord, who has always loved you and has secretly guided you all along
i saw that he was on the brink of madness
i bet her mouth would even begin to water!
it’s just like flax, and so thick!
the children were beautiful, he longed to fondle them, but was prevented by the thought: i have no right even to look into their innocent eyes because of what i am
about that time he met a beautiful and sensible girl; he was attracted to her and soon married her, hoping that her company would put an end to his lonely brooding
i would say almost an hour
kolya for some reason snorted as he said this
ah, i’ve forgotten the word—children usually like them very much
to make a long story short, lambert had understood plenty
this is the least forgivable way of being guilty
so let us be sincere, all of us!
it was getting dark and i decided to go out
chimed in still others
i enjoyed particularly your pious introduction dedicated to the bishop
well, precisely because we are in the presence of one of these wide-ranging natures, the karamazov nature, that can accommodate simultaneously the most contradictory traits and the two infinities—the infinite heights of the most noble ideals and the infinite depths of the lowest festering degradation
and so, while alphonsine and i went on our way to lambert's, mrs prutkov rushed off to katerina's
we ask not only your prayers but also your prophetic insights
a hundred and forty gold half-imperials were counted out to me
i swear i did not bring her here
the train was already there
that makes it very convenient for thrusting under people’s noses on all sorts of occasions
the whole pack was set on the boy and the hounds tore him to pieces before his mother’s eyes
i went over to him, but for some reason the sight of me frightened him and he rushed away
in view of all this, katerina, who had never left her father's side during his illness, wrote to andronikov, in his capacity as lawyer and trusted friend, a letter in which she asked him to set her straight on a few points
she’ll pay me back for that, for every kopek of it!
he wants to be a rothschild or somebody like that and withdraw into his own greatness
he was completely changed; it was really an unbelievable change that took place in him
another example is that story about the english offering a million rubles to zavialov not to put his trademark on his products
yours are the only tears i want
all lambert did was to fill my glass and to exchange glances with alphonsine
please, arkady dear, stop gambling, i beg you
of course, there was much that was false in the whole business and it irritated ivan terribly
he was a fool
but what the hell!
it’s not right that peasants should smoke those expensive cigars you gave them the last time
you sound as if you have him well in hand
he howled, leaping up
yes, i had a presentiment of everything
the most surprising thing of all was that there was guilt in his eyes too; he would looked at me the way an accused might look at his judge
and what if there is no god?
she got up and quickly walked to the door
mr karamazov had always liked to exchange a few words and a joke or two at the end of the meal, while he was having dessert, even with gregory
do not be avaricious, do not love gold and silver
learn to enjoy prostrating yourself and kissing the earth
she looked at him in silence, her eyes imploring him, but did not dare to come closer
i knew that dmitry was capable of killing, but i never thought that he’d steal, while from you i could expect anything
so that's all right-let them forget!
through the crack lise, too, saw alyosha’s finger and she flung open the door
and that’s enough now—it’s over
but, for a moment, i really thought that i would finally succeeded in getting you out of my mind and in being able to laugh at my stupid passion
by geneva ideas, i meant virtue without christ, which is the contemporary concept or, we may even say, the idea underlying today's civilization
so now, see, i stake ten rubles
oh, he was weeping with ecstasy, weeping, even, over those stars that shone down upon him from infinite distances, and he was unashamed of his ecstasy
then she discovered that, on occasion, maximov was quite good at telling stories, and gradually he became almost indispensable to her
you dare do nothing—you, a man who talked so big!
lise’s voice trilled suddenly through the crack of a door to a side room
but you had not realized that, arkady dolgoruky, not till now!
so then, dmitry was a wild beast to him and had been for a long time
listen, he said, i don’t really suspect you
i go to the window myself and lean very far out of it
did you really want to see me very much?
that is, i did give my full assent
dmitry said, bursting into a peal of laughter
let us be bold, let us even be ruthless, gentlemen of the jury, for it is our duty on this occasion; we must not be afraid of words and ideas, like those characters in ostrovsky’s comedy, who are terrorized by words whose meaning they do not understand
please, do not deprive me of my god now, for knowing myself, i am afraid i will rise against him
the prince became very agitated and tried to convince me that i had been rendering him incredibly important services, that he needed me to render him even more important ones, indeed, that fifty rubles was nowhere near enough to pay for them, that he planned to give me a raise because he felt he owed it to me, that he himself had made the original arrangements with mrs prutkov, but that they had completely slipped his mind, oh, quite unforgivably
no, i’ve nothing to say about the money—i have no wish to offend you, misha
while she was being questioned, mitya kept silent, his eyes fixed on the ground, as if he had been turned to stone
it was pneumonia, he had
the only reason i offered him that bet was because i felt like showing off and also because i wanted everybody to pay attention to me
besides, you’re not legally of age yet and cannot dispose of your money
what was he talking about?
it’s about the execution in geneva, not more than five years ago, of a twenty-three-year-old convicted murderer called richard
we’re both good and bad, bad and good
it's like a dream, like a nightmare, i said, feeling deeply depressed
we used to live on the land, but we moved to town
oh, i have got you worrying about me
it never even occurred to me
within you, that problem has not been solved and yours is a great unhappiness, because the problem demands an answer
she said, and smiled at me once again, a farewell smile now, as she went downstairs
he has risen from the table because he has seen me, and he’s coming over here
he fooled me, as if i were a little boy
tell her that i have ordered you to keep her here
the presiding judge addressed himself directly to the accused, asking him whether he had any comments in connection with gregory’s testimony
i wish they’d let ladies come and watch those duels
i will certainly be there!
moreover, i am sure i am not just imagining things if i say that at certain moments he looked at me with a strange, even uncanny love, as his hand came to rest tenderly on top of mine or as he gently patted my shoulder
after all, we are father and son, and it would be too disgusting for words
it was an appointment, but not of that kind at all
ah, this is from that hell kitten
from alyosha’s very appearance, father paisii could tell that a violent upheaval was taking place within the youth
but he gave his brother an accurate enough picture, repeating the principal words exchanged, the key gestures, indicating his own reactions by some simple detail
which means, to sum up briefly, said father paisii, stressing every word, that, according to certain theories of which the point has become only too clear in our nineteenth century, the church is to evolve into a state, the way a lower order of life evolves into a higher one, and eventually is to disappear altogether as a religious institution, being superseded by science, technical progress, and secularism
he often came to ask me for money
and you attended miss akhmakov?
their time will come, he thought
it was, as i learned later, the door of the landlady's room
he even disgusts alphonsine so she wo not let him come close to her
nor perhaps with someone like him either, for that matter
and i swear that, if i were not absolutely certain now that i am no longer the same man, that i have gained strength, and that my character has been forged by life, i could never make such a confession to the reader
and, above all, let us not be afraid of words we cannot understand like ostrovsky’s ignorant characters; let us face our problems as reason dictates, rather than having our decisions dictated by obscure, mystical concepts
the servants, gregory and smerdyakov, stood by
and so here i am, serving under protest so as to make it possible for things to happen, and acting against reason on superior orders
in the morning she got up and started pacing the room with a face all dead and expressionless
i keep peering through the crack every minute
he's on his feet again
did you see her?
as for the rest of the servants, they slept in the servants’ quarters in the basement, near the kitchen
you have spat in my eye and i feel elated
when i first saw him, the sight was a painful shock to me
but when you give up your faith under torture, you do it at a time when you have nothing else to do but think about that faith of yours, and that is just the proper time to stand up for it!
why, i could give her a suggestion of what she could do with herself if she asked me for advice
after a few words from the priest and brief instructions from the presiding judge, the witnesses were led away and seated as far as possible from one another
the first to accuse smerdyakov of the murder was the accused himself, the moment he was arrested, and, since that first accusation, to this very minute, he has never been able to offer us a single fact to corroborate his statement, or, indeed, anything that could be humanly considered as a hint of a fact
well, then, after seventy-seven defeats, the beggars will wipe out the shareholders, take their shares away from them, and, of course, become shareholders themselves
first, the important thing i wanted to see you about is the wedding
well, it’s almost five years now since kuzma brought me here
with that, you might have seen even the gates of heaven wide open, to say nothing of a door leading into the garden!
and since the interrogation must take place in your presence, you
at first mitya declined nelyudov’s friendly invitation to have a cup of tea too, but later he asked for some himself and drank it down greedily
they’ll shame me at the trial for that
so here is what i have decided, alexei, he went on, overcoming his emotion
his thoughts had obviously wandered away from the accounts he had before him
the boy threw his arms around the dog’s neck and at once his entire cheek was thoroughly licked by the animal
obediently i followed mother downstairs and out the front door
psychology tempts even the most responsible and serious people to create fictions, and they cannot really be blamed for that
gregory remained silent for a while
and what did you step on when you turned?
mrs prutkov yelled at the top of her voice, as if suddenly emerging from total blankness
the spectators were still dead silent; every single person seemed truly stunned, both those who had been hoping for an acquittal and those who had wanted a verdict of guilty
and how do you recognize him in a tom-tit?
mais ce nest pas loin, monsieur, c'est pas loin du tout; ga ne vaut pas la peine de mettre votre manteau; c'est ici, tout press, monsieur!
good heavens, of course!
as alyosha left the hermitage, hurrying to get to the monastery (where he was, of course, simply to wait on table) in time for lunch, his heart suddenly contracted painfully and he stopped dead: the elder’s words announcing his own impending end came back to him
i don’t think i’ll last out another year
you wouldn’t stay and watch, maria, you’d be in a big hurry to get out of there
mitya, let them dance; don’t interfere
she cried, stamping her foot
oh, of course, she may have blushed at first, but then she must have made the necessary effort and listened to what he had to offer
mitya felt life returning to him
may i come in?
it’s a shame they felt they had to drag that flunkey into it
i can see right through him now
ah yes, that’s right!
three days later, he left the monastery in accordance with the wish of his late elder, who had directed him to go out into the world
but i am not responsible for this foolishness that weighs so heavily on me
whether you do or not, he is still a crook!
you love him just the way he is, you love his insulting you
well, let's say he's a sort of religious tramp
this is what mitya, gnashing his teeth, was saying to himself, and so it is hardly surprising that he thought he might end up with brain fever
everything seemed perfectly clear now
it so happened that that morning tatyana prutkov had had to appear before the judge to answer a charge brought against her by her cook
but that was a new mystery
a short while ago, a witness produced three thousand rubles in cash, claiming that these bills had once been enclosed in the envelope that is one of the exhibits on that table there and that he received the money yesterday from smerdyakov
i’d rather be condemned as a thief and a murderer before my victim and before all other men, and be sent to siberia, he thought that night, than give katya the right to say that, after having betrayed her, i stole her money and used it to run away with grushenka and start a new, virtuous’ life with her
but what irritated ivan most about the man and gave him a strong feeling of revulsion for him was a certain unpleasant familiarity that smerdyakov began to display toward him, which increased every time they talked
and what happened to it?
you are the only one i can rely on now
next to him on a little table lay three or four books and a pair of silver-rimmed glasses
then, one evening when he came home from his office, nikolai informed me in his usual style, briefly and without going into unnecessary explanations, that i was to call on a certain prince v at his apartment on myasnitskaya street the following morning at eleven o'clock
thoughts, though few, seemed on the way,
i can just imagine what you went through!
i was wholly conquered
i personally feel, mr karamazov, that you are more the victim of unhappy circumstances than a really bad man
mamma rushed to embrace me when she learned the news
but you did not mean that seriously!
for about a hundred paces i followed the high stone walls that enclosed the back yards
then suddenly an angry man came rushing out from the nearby arcade
he has no idea you’re coming
versilov being my father
i simply cannot believe it—i’m still in a fog
otherwise it would mean that everyone has to be everyone else’s enemy in the world
he was at least seventy-five years old and he lived behind the hermitage apiary, by the wall, in a dilapidated wooden shack that had been built long before, back in the eighteenth century, for another famous observer of fasts and silence, one father jonas, who had lived to the age of a hundred and five and about whose acts of devotion many curious stories were told in the monastery and in the surrounding countryside
when you say something, you go right to the essence of things
i detected, however, a shadow of suffering in that smile, or rather something compassionate, reflecting feelings of a higher order—i do not know how to express it, but it is a fact that highly sophisticated people are incapable of having triumphantly happy and exultant faces
i saw this thing long ago at mr morozov’s, old man, and i got it for you
the tsar will decorate me, and when i come here no one will dare to
i’m a despicable beast, he whispered
why, i’m sure the monks in the monastery take it for granted that hell has, for instance, a ceiling
it is a fact that, for all his passion lor katerina, versilov had always been highly skeptical of her moral qualities
mitya pulled all the bills out of his pocket again and found a ten-ruble bill among them
that was the end of ivan’s misgivings and the mere thought of his brother dmitry became loathsome to him
and did he ever mention in your presence, even if only vaguely or when he was irritated, that he
so now you know my personal opinion!
oh, this is only half of the former versilov: this man refuses to be parted from mother, and i know he will never leave her again
for several seconds mitya stared at the old man
you might not believe me if i told you that what i did that night could hardly be described as weeping: i literally howled like an animal, something that i would never done before (or since)
mother added, detecting something that might have been a smile on the old lady's lips
ah, hell, what's the matter with him anyhow!
after listening attentively to gregory’s dignified and precise account of the erection of the gravestone, he stood there for a while, his head bowed, then walked away without a word
our family goes back a thousand years and is as aristocratic as the house of the rohans, but we have not got a kopek to our name
well, of course, he couldn’t tell you then, but it was precisely about that plan of escape
moreover, most people do not even know how to laugh
you are right—do not desert him
but versilov was already lying unconscious on the floor next to lambert
my brothers are bent on destroying themselves and so is my father
it is true that they were received in the best society, thanks to their maternal relatives, the fanariotovs, and their connection with versilov's former friend, the old prince nikolai sokolsky
only please don’t go provoking people or we’ll get into trouble, like that time with the goose, remember?
he did not look at the document that was lying there on the table
at last she caught him by the arm and pulled him violently to her
what i meant by that, and the reason i said it then, smerdyakov said, was that, although you knew your own father was about to be murdered, you left him there to be killed so that later people wouldn’t say wicked things about your feelings for him, and perhaps a few other things as well
inside my head was chaos; nothing made any sense to me
he wanted to know what dmitry was like at the time
what shall i call you, by the way?
why, makar, of course
well, in that case, i am lost
don’t cry, papa
and in the hands of a strong and intelligent girl like anna, he would straighten out and be really happy
somebody tried that before and got a bloody nose, they reason, so if somebody else tries it, he will get his nose bloodied too
still, the three thousand rubles he would given me in paris—he never even claimed it back from me, never even made note of it, and i, i accepted it
while i was telling lisa all this about vasin, she listened to me with a peculiar smile and then commented that whatever had happened to vasin was bound to happen just as it did
their severity varied—some were quite mild, others very violent
obviously, however, such fancies are bound to be pale, blurred, and trivial; only transferring them to real life will do them full justice
that something was my duel
it may sound incredible, but sometimes at night or when there's no one around he suddenly starts weeping and he weeps like no one else—he sort of howls in an awful way, and, strangely enough, it just breaks your heart from pity
after that, he wrote a full confession to the authorities and early in the morning, with this document in hand, he reported to the officer in command of the regiment and informed him that he was a common-law criminal and an accomplice in forgery, that he was giving himself up to the authorities, and that he wanted to stand trial
he didn’t answer and i only felt his fingers giving a little jerk in my hand
just like that: 'guilty'
after he had left, mitya kept working on the half-asphyxiated drunkard for half an hour, constantly wetting the man’s head, and he was quite determined to keep at it the rest of the night
you know, my boy, there are painful memories that cause us real physical pain; almost everyone has such memories, but most people lose them
i could tell you a few things about him
i am surprised that maria did not tell you everything herself
you’re that house painter!
i know that now mother often sits down next to him and, smiling meekly, starts talking to him in a quiet voice, sometimes on the most abstract subjects
yes, yes, but still she allowed me to open my heart within tatyana's earshot; she allowed that woman to listen because she must have realized that tatyana would not miss the opportunity to eavesdrop, she knew that tatyana would laugh at me
ah, but if she only knew who he was!
after a minute of silence, the guitar resounded again and the falsetto drawled the final verse of the song:
yes, you represent russia now, and your verdict will be heard not only in this courtroom, but all over the country, and all russia will be either strengthened or let down by this verdict of yours!
those eyes of yours, they’re looking at me and saying ah, you lousy, drunken swine!
what kind of baby can katerina have since she isn’t married?
it makes no difference where you are: far or near, you are always present
ivan listened, staring at the presiding judge with his lusterless eyes
in the end, however, these people’s words reached his ears too, words uttered at first in hushed tones, then gradually louder as the visitors grew bolder
she saw how i was shoved
fenya, whose frightening experience of two hours before had left her in such a state of fear and anxiety that she could not make up her mind to go to bed, was now frightened almost into hysterics by the banging at the gate
where men offer gods no haven
do you know where he is now, by any chance?
she belongs to the stern type—a 'young nun,  as you yourself once characterized her, or a 'self-possessed maiden,  as i have always thought of her
you are all i have on earth now, so what will i do if you leave?
i wo not allow them to search me, i wo not stand for it!
but enough of this!
save us from ourselves!
that's a good wish too
despair may be combined with irreconcilable resentment, and, at the moment of perishing by his own hand, a suicide may find his hatred doubled for those he envied during his life
i am glad to see you have found yourself a nice place, he said, getting to his feet
i don’t want you to whip him
you’re trying to overcome my disbelief in you and convince me that you exist by means of realism
and yet i left him with a very painful feeling: i had seen that morning how much he had changed toward me
when i was young, i often grew angry when the cook served me a meal that was too hot or my orderly brought me my boots not properly polished
it’s all right with me
ah, yes, i caught a cold, but not here on earth
of miss anna versilov
so he wanted to kill you, too?
and what about the old man?
well, you ca not imagine how much better a person i become when i am here with you than i am usually
he was wound up and trembling
no, my angel, miss katerina, i promised you nothing at all, grushenka interrupted, looking at her with the same cheerful, innocent expression
one of them was clean-shaven and dressed in the european style, while the other had a graying beard and wore some medal or other on a red ribbon around his neck
but i guess god would forgive even an old man if he got to love life out of the gaiety of his soul
he suddenly clutched at my jacket and drew me closer toward him
he stood up, smiling pensively
let it all be done tomorrow at the same time!
fyodor karamazov immediately installed a regular harem in the house and indulged in the most scandalous drunken debauchery
so that's all there was to it!
it was she who did all the proposing
i count on you to remind me of it when i get carried away by other things
no, but she was afraid that it was anna who had the letter
he knew that katerina lived with two aunts—that is, one of these women was actually her sister agafia’s quiet, self-effacing aunt who had lived in her father’s house and had looked after katerina with such devotion when she had come home after her graduation from school
: he still had not been to see the old prince)
once, a week or so before his death, katerina suggested that he invite me, hoping it might distract him, but the mere thought of it made him frown
one of them would beat me up first thing every morning and force me to bring him his boots while calling me disgusting names and explaining the secrets of my birth to the great enjoyment of the others
if even a boy like you is a sensualist underneath, that leaves very little doubt about ivan, who was born of the same mother and is a karamazov too
but mitya sat down of his own accord
how can they fail to acquit him!
you find it funny!
and so touchy too
if i decided to come here, it was to try hard to convince you that there's nothing left that should offend you
whenever someone is too close to me, i feel my personal dignity and freedom are being infringed upon
it’s a bit spoilt by russian nationalism, though: there’s still not a single frenchwoman there, although they could easily afford some—it’s a very prosperous monastery indeed
that’s a filthy lie!
no, of course not, shell be back in a moment
there’s nothing new, is there?
even if gregory himself came to the door, the master would only let him in when he recognized his voice
i gave him the same version i would given her—i mean about kraft destroying the letter
you drive me frantic with your fussing and screaming
obviously the pole spoke russian much better than he pretended and deliberately tried to pronounce russian words in such a way as to make them sound polish
but there's something about your face that has stayed with me all my life, and a feeling that it was the face of my mother
but tell me, is it forgivable for a man to make a woman wait for him?
the general died soon after his daughter; they even say that it was his grief over her death that triggered his last stroke, which came three months later
and it so happened that, just at that moment, the wife of colonel ferzing, the commanding officer of the infantry regiment stationed in the town, came down to take the ferry
yes, yes, that's right, oh good lord!
and kind people come to see me every day
i won’t wait till he comes back
well, so i’m a russian too, and i have that russian trait
so what could karamazov offer her now?
you couldvc; copied at least the last page, i said
you also like women too much
fine, but who are those witnesses?
i was giving you good advice, but if you wish i will bet you on the side that the zero will come up again
ah, lise, he’s a kind, sincere man, and that makes it all the more difficult in such cases!
you must be crazy—what do you mean by 'everybody'?
and i remembered my brother markel saying, mother, my own dear blood, every one of us is answerable for everyone else, but we don’t know it; if we did, we would at once have heaven on earth!
why, do you suppose i couldn’t put up with that woman?
but i got there only in time to see her getting into a sleigh that had been waiting for her by the main entrance
let us first examine the possibility that smerdyakov did it on his own
very good, then, tomorrow i will find among your shirts one with a piece torn off it
where could you possibly have heard that?
you mean ivan goes to see him, then?
but be sure to find out all about that horrible child and then tell me, because i’m sure there must be some mystery there
but i promise you this: when i’m close to thirty and decide to throw down my cup of life, i’ll come especially to have one more talk with you—wherever i may be, even if i’m in america, i’ll come all the way back to see you
you know what, mitya—i think i’ll become a nun
what, i’ve lost two hundred already?
nor did the pockmarked man exchange a word with the two young fellows who joined us almost at once, although it was quite obvious that he knew them very well
papa,  he said then, still, you mustn’t make up with him
as alyosha was turning away again, the boy, enraged, hurled another stone at him, this time aimed straight at his face
why are its arms bare?
i knew it was a crime and the realization was like a long, sharp needle piercing my heart
well, then i suppose we shall meet again—in the world
he thought he would just look around from the porch, for walking was too strenuous for him in his weak state and, besides, the pain in the small of his back and in his right leg was becoming unbearable
i would like to know, she said, laughing and crying at the same time, how you can be the guiltiest of all?
why, do join us
and, anyway, what could i do if he kept badgering me?
two or three times a smile broke through her seriousness; at one point she blushed deeply, but toward the end she appeared very worried and turned paler
then, for a couple of days before the murder, he had been away from the house without permission, and no one knew where he had been during that time
even though he may have decided to part from versilov for ever and ever
but bad and wicked though we may become—which god forbid should happen to us—whenever we remember ilyusha, how he died, how we loved him, how united we all were by this big stone, the cruelest and the most sarcastic of us, if that is what he has become, will still never dare, deep inside, to laugh at the good, kind boy he was at this moment!
who am i for you to do that
he’s a different man altogether
so i went to grushenka’s to give her a good thrashing
it’s only a little dirty here, by the sleeve
the medical officer who accompanied us to your father’s house and who examined smerdyakov while we were there told us that he may not even live till morning
only the mediocrities, the unimaginative bystanders, are having a great time
oh, what a stupid and undignified position i was in, without even suspecting it!
there’s so much strength in me that i feel i will overcome everything
indeed, i confess i do not really know how to define it myself
i ca not believe you, doctor
don’t worry, they know me
i spelled it out to him en toutes lettres: he was just stupid and nasty, and the sarcastic grin that was spreading over his face only showed how smug and vulgar he was, for the consideration of the lawsuit had never entered my mind all this time while it had immediately germinated inside his ponderous skull
he’s damned coherent, ivan thought, and even if he mumbles a bit, i can’t see how herzenstube could find signs of impairment to his mental faculties
but he was also in a tremendous hurry
god bless you, boy
all right, let’s get going now!
that may sound absurd, but when you think of it, it makes sense
i had breakfast on vasilievsky island, deliberately bypassing the tavern on the petersburg side where i had had supper the previous evening because the mere recollection of that place with its nightingale had become sickening to me
but you just told us that you got that money a month ago!
our visitors did not attend the service, but arrived just as it was over
i pressed vasin's hand warmly and ran to catch up with kraft, who all the time i would been talking with vasin had been walking on ahead of us
the old man, dignified and stern, stood waiting for him and, as he walked toward him, mitya felt that samsonov had thoroughly appraised him
this letter will cost you thirty thousand rubles!
for a moment i thought you were talking seriously about the church doing such things as prosecuting criminals and sentencing people to floggings, detention, and even, i suppose, death
besides, did not you tell me that you had a broad-minded attitude toward women and did not you even exclaim 'long live tolerance!
but do let’s go in, by all means
but i’m strong and silent because i’ve made a final and irrevocable decision
but for that you’ll have to listen to what i have to say
neither nelyudov, that boy with whom only a few days ago i exchanged those stupid remarks about women, nor that consumptive prosecutor really deserves my trust in telling them all these things, mitya now thought mournfully
good evening, quiet one
why had he remembered this later with disgust?
i really don’t remember where i got the rag
i will go toward obukhov avenue, i thought, then i will turn left and walk all the way to semyonovsky regiment barracks
well, of course, there must be certain differences between people
go after him, smurov!
he started as if frightened and stared at me
i had to be back in fontanka around noon to see vasin (that was the likeliest time to find him at home), so i walked very fast, resisting the temptation to stop and have a cup of coffee somewhere
despite the fact that her family accepted the situation quite soon and gave the runaway bride her dowry, relations between husband and wife became an everlasting succession of quarrels
i’ll pull that cassock off his back
yes, no doubt about it, the russian mind
others replied at once
in the suburb where she was confined, there was one dr granz, a man weighed down by a large family whom they paid half a thaler—that's the position the doctors are in there
a frightening verse
i have the feeling that these are not really your own opinions that you’ve been expressing, alyosha said in as friendly and unassertive a way as he could, but kolya heatedly interrupted him

i know you’ll tell me the whole truth, mitya, alyosha muttered nervously
it's quite obvious that they are acting in concert
but why should she be standing on a chair?
or is it nothing but a piece of fiction, like all the rest?
i bet you’re a high-school kid
i fully accept your apology, mr former officer, and i am sure that you are a man endowed with unquestionable abilities
stop saying insulting things to him
and yet he did as she asked him and went
yes, i certainly have many of the traits of a gambler and my soul is an unquiet one
from certain intonations in stebelkov's voice, i gathered that he was now dominating the conversation, for instead of his ingratiating tone of the beginning, he had reverted to his usual loud familiarity and i imagined him sprawling on a sofa, as he had in vasin's room, telling the women long and involved stories punctuated with now note this, and do you follow me?
she asked me, by the way, to reassure you about the escape, to tell you that you can do it with a clear conscience
is there really such a thing as rabid little boys, mother?
the stupider, the clearer
the house porter opened the door and a lady emerged from the house and started to get into the carriage
but i want you to understand that i like common people
why, you act like a flunkey with everybody you come across
don’t cry, mother, don’t, he’d tell her
to be precise, though, it was not actually twenty, but seven

we thought we’d burst our insides laughing

it was as if the ground i was standing on had suddenly been pulled out from under me and i literally fell at her feet
i learned a lot from him, for he was a highly intelligent person

although he was fascinated by her, he wondered at the same time, with a touch of irritation, why she had to drawl as she did, instead of speaking naturally
she was running, completely out of breath, and as soon as she reached him, she let out a cry and threw herself down at his feet
i suppose she would had it ready for me for several days
versilov was at home
finally, he took it for granted that everybody else was just about as unscrupulous and crooked as himself
i do feel the same, i do, so please take it
versilov got up and picked up his hat
as a matter of fact, alyosha was convinced that there was not a man in the whole world who would wish to offend him or, for that matter, who could offend him
well, i acted in the most decent way i could and it was certainly not to my advantage
did you say kuzmichev?
it takes a while, a second maybe, and then there comes a moment, no, i don’t mean a moment—damn the moment—i mean an image, that is, the object or the event or whatever it is
but what is there to prevent me from imagining, for instance, that, while sitting locked up inside his house, waiting nervously and anxiously for his beloved to come, old fyodor karamazov might, just to while away the time, have torn open the envelope, reasoning thus: she may not believe me if i just tell her what this envelope contains; it might be better to show her a bundle of thirty rainbow-colored, hundred-ruble bills in my hand; that would certainly impress her very much more!
and never, never thereafter would alyosha forget that moment
i jumped to my feet, quickly found a cab, and, constantly urging him to whip on his wretched nag, i hurried to sergei's

i want you to know, prosecutor, that i thought myself of the scheme you have just suggested to me
obviously the small sheet was not large enough for mitya’s drunken prolixity, so he not only filled in all the margins but also scribbled the last lines across the top of what he had already written
the courtroom became so utterly quiet that one could have heard the buzzing of a fly
and if, early in life, they became conscious of the lurking disorderliness and unfairness around them, the breach of dignity in the parental home, the lack of solid family traditions and of a beautiful, fully evolved way of life—it was all to the good because, after having questioned the value of these traditions, they returned to them in full awareness and were in a better position to understand and appreciate them
get out of here, dmitry, at once!
so what do you say to it?
how did you manage to get all covered with blood like that!
and then that strange thing had happened again: he had repeated word for word my thought about living three lives, just as i had formulated it to kraft the day before, using almost the same words
the counsel for the defense started like a battle-horse at the sound of a trumpet
every principle i consider sacred prevents me from doing what you expect me to do
mitya left him and dashed upstairs like a madman to see fenya
it is quite natural that you, just like any other young man, might be interested in knowing a young and beautiful woman who readily entertained the local young élite
i believe he's somewhere around here now, in this room
he is jealous of his own father!
you didn’t get married in poland, did you, maximov?
they went downstairs, but stopped outside the inn
and i enjoyed cruelty
and now you’re fooling around
and then, on the last note, she faints!
love one another, fathers
his bearing was deferential but dignified, without the least subservience
and in another group i heard:
i mean, i could not make myself
but, confessing as if to god, i say to you: no, i am not guilty of my father’s blood!
he realized, though, that it would be even more difficult to transmit dmitry’s message to her now that dmitry had given up all hope of paying her back the three thousand rubles
by that time the emancipation of women will have become a reality and the new woman will have come into existence
i may be accused of improvidence, but at least no one can say that i am not straightforward
apart from the hundred rubles, i would be equipped, as i explained, with courage, perseverance, relentlessness, complete self-sufficiency, and secrecy
it was father anfim who taught me to love children
looks to me like there’s some kind of plot between them
the church fathers decreed that confession should be whispered into the priest’s ear, that only then would it be a sacrament

mr ivan says,  he told me, that everything is permitted in the world, that from now on nothing is forbidden—yes, that’s what mr ivan told me
the whole thing made me laugh
this is really a blessing granted us by the judiciary reform
mother also looked quite worried, obviously feeling that something had gone wrong between us
but french girls will soon hear of it and they’ll come of their own accord
so, in a way, the defense counsel may have achieved his objective
precisely because, having praised him, i had lowered myself before him
his dark-brown hair was short and combed forward at the temples
it does not depend on me, you understand, the doctor said impatiently
why, have you finally fallen for her too?
no, even if they didn’t exist, those hooks, il faudrait les inventer, even especially for me, because you can’t even begin to imagine, my boy, all the disgraceful things i’ve done
and so i could not restrain myself
it was the first time i had seen this self-controlled man let himself go like this
really, i am sort of split into two, mentally that is, and i am terribly afraid of it
the man had been walking around in rags, begging for coppers, and had become a familiar figure in that part of the country
i want him here
my officer is arriving, rakitin
to my great surprise, she told me that he would left even earlier than she had, which must have been very early indeed since she herself had left at daybreak
finally, i warned versilov that if the doctor did not leave me alone, i would tell him things ten times more unpleasant than what i would already told him
and so she went home very seldom; she slept outside and the townsfolk fed her, believing her to be a holy fool
that’s right, i owe it to you
she came here because she's trying to steal something from me
i was expecting anna versilov to make some sort of scornful gesture or to give me a humiliating look, as her brother did in moscow the moment we met
but, on the other hand, this prince sergei was reputed to be a show-off who liked to play the role of a young millionaire whenever he could, here as well as in moscow, in paris as well as among the officers of his former regiment
mitya shouted at the top of his voice, roaring with laughter
last april  a few guests came over in the evening to congratulate maria on her name day
she had a baby by prince sergei sokolsky—a child of her insanity and not of her love, a consequence of one of prince sergei's most despicable deeds
did not i tell you to put on a clean collar?
he was just as sincere as you are, although he spoke in an amused tone, with a sort of bitter humor
but i do not suppose you would understand
you’re just a little boy, alyosha, so here’s a piece of advice for you: never ask the woman you love for forgiveness!
i do not think that, during the final scene at mrs prutkov's or even on the previous day, versilov could have had any clear objective in mind at all
what's wrong or immoral about these millions passing from the hands of various jews, all sorts of harmful and unscrupulous people, into the hands of a sober, strong, austere man who watches the world vigilantly with wide-open eyes?
i could see that it was the word jealous that had somehow struck him so strongly
did she laugh at me too?
no, please don’t decide
and once, after he had talked at great length and with great feeling, he suddenly turned very pale, his face became twisted, and he stared at me fixedly
you knew, you couldn’t help knowing, this fundamental mystery of human nature and, knowing it, you nevertheless spurned the only banner that was offered you, that would have made them follow you and worship you without a murmur—the banner of earthly bread
and if you only knew what went on just one hour ago and what sort of prophetic dream came true!
on dergachev and the rest, i have no further information
you know me, o lord
but whatever he does, he won’t get grushenka—i’ll turn him into dirt before he gets her
he said, suddenly beginning to laugh
but there are among them some, though not many, peculiar types who believe in god—christians who are at the same time socialists
his eyes, small, quick, and shiny, made two bright dots in his face
it’s he who killed father and stole the money!
and i’ll go east, away from all of you, and i don’t want to know anybody at all
wouldo you know,  she said then, 'he was trying to insult me
i don’t want to be here, mitya
i certainly never expected to meet a slavophile here!
europe has produced noble types of frenchmen, englishmen, and germans, but it still knows almost nothing about the man of the future
shouted darzan, interrupting his own conversation
that won’t last—i know him only too well
i do not think so
i dreamed incessantly of running away for two months
it wasn’t far to the church, three hundred yards or so
i was always convinced that he would send my relatives the three thousand rubles as soon as he got that money from his father, she testified further
i won’t be just your mistress—i’ll be your true and faithful wife, your slave, and i’ll work for you
but soon the old crank affected me in an unexpected way, aroused something resembling pity in me; toward the end of the month i felt strangely attached to him and gave up my plan of being deliberately rude to him
rakitin cried, again genuinely surprised
do not worry, i will behave, i came with that intention, i said, squeezing her arm
he turned to the clerk; his face very red with anger, and with a strange, shrill note vibrating in his voice, he said:
i realized only too well that my words were pouring out like water through a sieve, that i was inconsistently skipping from one thought to another
and in no time i was out of his sight
the far corner was screened off by a curtain, or rather a sheet, hanging on another clothes line that stretched across the angle formed by the walls
what would i do there?
when i mentioned the moscow lady who was almost as beautiful as anna, i tried to make it sound as if these words had slipped unthinkingly from my lips, assuming that such a spontaneous compliment would be more appreciated by a woman than carefully thought-up praise
will you never get tired of this game?
i wondered if you did not know something about it?
for even if the righteous in heaven forgave them at the sight of their sufferings and, in their infinite love, called them to join them in heaven, they would only further exasperate their suffering, for that would simply intensify their burning thirst to give the responsive, active, and grateful love which was now beyond their power forever
vasin said enigmatically when he saw me
she pulled out of her bosom a small embroidered belt, looked at it, and at once began shaking with sobs, the tears flowing from her eyes, which she covered with her fingers
you know, prince, sometimes you say the most delightful things
you have as much right as the rich and the mighty
how did you get in here?
i want to make an educated man out of you!
and that old fellow maximov is there with her, too
finally i decided that i would ring at the apartment door and ask the cook whether her mistress was at home
but that was all a lot of nonsense and i wish you hadn’t bothered to come
it was almost night and so dark that it was hard to make out anything thirty yards away
it started long ago when for the last time i rushed off abroad
and that is the kind of person she is
i remember the sun suddenly brightening up the room when the curtains were drawn and the crackling of the stove that somebody had lighted, although i have no recollection of who lighted it or when
yes, i, the boy without a family, was unexpectedly having a visitor, the first visitor i would had since i would been at touchard's school
i do not want to risk that now
i do not believe any of them, except mr karamazov, had ever been in a monastery before, and, as to miusov, it is unlikely that he had seen the inside even of a church for a good thirty years
then i would find him more intelligent, was the odd conclusion i finally came to
je pense, donc je suis, that is something i know for certain
and that would be that: he would take her and they would leave at once for the edge of the world
as a matter of fact, they had much more urgent things to worry about than excursions into russian literature
what was the reason for this sign which they, like father ferapont, had now seized upon so eagerly?
well, how is your health?
and then, turning to maximov, he added: and you too, sir
that’s the only thing i want to know
he, you see, tied himself to the monastery and almost became a monk
shortly after that, he would gone out to look for me, and i will never forget that he thought of me so soon
when he acted in his official capacity, however, he immediately became extremely grave as if, at that moment, he considered his duties and his person sacred
father paisii performed these rituals and, after sponging the body, clothed it in monastic garb and wrapped it in a cloak which, as prescribed, he slit slightly so as to wrap it crosswise around the body
do you remember how you used to beat me up?
ah, how he hates her, how he hates her!
he indulged in the sweet things those rich ladies brought him in their pockets, didn’t he?
there, i took it out of the case and examined it in feverish haste
and now back to really important things
from my childhood on, every daydream i had was lighted by his presence, was spun around him, and finally converged on his person
the old man at once took the hint and stopped in his tracks
trishatov is no scum
once we spent the night with some fishermen on the bank of a large river
after he left, i stayed for ten minutes and then hurried home as fast as i could, running all the way, and i was terribly afraid of bumping into him on the way
i was particularly anxious to avoid meeting mother
he was, however, interrupted almost at once, this time by nelyudov
he expressed that wish in clear and precise terms, quite briefly and without indulging in a single exclamation
although i did read candide in a russian translation, an old and ridiculous translation, too
ah, is not it pleasant to think all sorts of rubbish
i want you, alyosha, to ask that young lady whom i offended not to be angry with me
still, the fact must be recognized—the disgraceful thing did happen
none of that sickening lot will ever understand that it would be ten times more dignified for them to keep their traps shut and not pay society the high tribute of asking for its sympathy
a child needs sunshine, he needs to play with other children, he needs someone to set him a good example, and above all he needs love, even if it is only a tiny drop of love
i always intended to propose to her; indeed, i am surprised it never occurred to me to carry out my intention
oh, i do not wish to go into the details of their relations
there were many books around, on the bookshelves, on the desk, all over the place (there were practically no books in mother's house), and i also saw sheets of paper covered with writing and many letters tied in bundles
also, it was noted approvingly that, although he had been in town only a very short time, a mere three days in fact, he seemed to have studied the case thoroughly and acquainted himself with all its finest points
in fact, in a sense, they even love the children because of the tortures they inflict upon them
after i had told him myself that i no longer loved dmitry and loved only him!
that is, if it is established that you have an indisputable claim to it
and, to make things worse, just two days earlier he would learned that katerina had agreed to a private meeting with versilov, who he knew was in love with her
not in the least
actually my regeneration was pretty stupid if considered in a broader sense, and perhaps if it had happened to me now, it would have been quite different
i mean the rag you sewed the money in?
alyosha started when he heard katerina call him vanya
all right, go now!
he and lambert were to wait outside until we would left and then rush upstairs, be let into the apartment by maria and wait for katerina
to alyosha, however, her face seemed even more attractive than before and it was a joy to him to look at her when he went to see her
they began to laugh and i laughed too, thinking that we were all laughing because it was funny
please, mon cher, stop shouting
so how could it have come to me, complete with all the details, as it did?
i know that e'est comique mais e'est ce que nous ferons
and the one who will unite us all in this noble feeling, the one whom we shall and are determined always to remember is our kind, sweet little ilyusha, the boy whom we shall cherish forever and ever!
yes, father, it wouldn’t be right for me to go to see her, it wouldn’t be right at all
my god, i said, you wo not even trust me now!
but i am getting ahead of my story
but a minute or so later she declared: it is all my fault, because i was leading them on, both of them, the old man and him, and it was i who put them in that state
but last night it was something else again
don’t be so bashful, my child
don’t give me any more wine, mitya, she mumbled, don’t
no, i would never dare to stake on the zero
maybe we should call a doctor
but now, hearing what he would actually done, i was filled with boundless admiration for him, together with shame and repentance for my own cynicism and failure to appreciate his nobility
nothing of the sort ever entered my mind
nor will be move away from me, because all of a sudden he doesn’t trust me anymore and is terribly frightened, and so he sticks close to me
she was tall, rather on the slender side, with an oval and strikingly pale face framed by luxuriant black hair; her expression was not particularly friendly but very dignified; her age, twenty-two
there, the hall porter told me that miss versilov had gone to tsarskoe and would not be back before perhaps this time tomorrow at the earliest
the room i was waiting in, the larger of the two, had enough space for a person to turn around in, although it was cluttered with furniture
i realize that i have been caught in some sort of trap, she said, but if you really have that letter
she thought i would not because it would completely ruin my whole future and i would not be able to start out on a new career
well, she simply went over to prince nikolai's and proposed to him
just a minute, please
no, you are not being reasonable
i ask you, then, who will ever believe you when you haven’t got one single bit of evidence to prove it?
but what about the double, the double!
once ilyusha asked about you, but he never said anything more after that
you see, i found him, took him home, and locked him up without letting anyone see him until the last day
i got up too
perhaps it’s because i’m too contemptible
i was roaming around, filled with that anguish, and suddenly i knew i loved her in a way i would never loved her before
why precisely yesterday evening?
don’t you find it awkward to reach it, carrying it on your right side?
just tell her that i do not give a damn about lambert and that if she sends him to me, i will kick him out
i found myself in quite an unexpected position and felt at a loss
and that feeling took such a hold on me, i was surprised at myself, worrying about what a mere boy thought of me
to your health, arkady, let's clink glasses!
hey, kids, kolya said, stepping into the room, what a dangerous lot you are!
i wouldn’t think of wasting a sum like that so thoughtlessly
you see, fenya
anyway, there's nothing so unusual about the whole affair
when they had counted it all up, there was eight hundred and thirty-six rubles and forty kopeks
but how could you stop a man like that?
then an irritated woman shouted so loudly behind the partition that we could distinctly hear every word she said:
and she herself kissed lisa
oh, by that time i was already running after touchard with the clothesbrush to flick the last speck of dust off his coat!
that is to say, i was lying only in the sense that the letter was actually in my hands and that kraft had never had it
alyosha entered the room
because i’m sure you’ll get rich, i’m sure of it
you put it very cleverly, you know
i want you to feel completely at home and, above all, not to be ashamed of yourself, for that is what causes all the trouble
astounding news has reached the class
i see now that your little boy is a good son
he’s the best man in the world and he’s leaving it
money comes only after that, for without a noble idea human society is doomed
he watched my expression intently, but i believe he never suspected that i had learned something since our previous meeting
his hair was really too white and his face was round and also too white, indecently so, and his skin was like that of a small child
then suddenly the rumor spread that it was fyodor karamazov
i’ve heard in the market place, and your mother, most inconsiderate of my feelings, also told me, that lizaveta went around with her hair standing on end and that she was just a wee bit over four feet; she dragged out those words, although she could perfectly well have said a wee bit in the ordinary way
it smelled of none-too-clean napkins
why should such a man live?
i’ve become really frightened for him
alyosha could not help asking
alyosha stood and gazed for a while; then, like a blade of grass cut by a scythe, he fell to the ground
the nephew recognized mitya right away, for mitya had often tipped him, and he opened the gate with a cheerful smile
but what i’m most afraid of is that, later, they’ll say i was his accomplice if he tries to do something stupid of that sort to his father
he went up to the table, filled a glass, emptied it and filled it again
do you see that tree there?
mitya kept repeating like a man in a fever
when i grow up, i’ll challenge him to a duel myself, and i’ll kill him!
listen, sofia, i am about to disappear again, but i am sure i will be back very soon because i will get frightened and where else could i find another angel to cure me of my fright?
that’s not what i’m trying to tell you
get out, you whore!
fine, let’s go to grushenka’s, alyosha answered right away in a completely indifferent tone
i did not ask you for money, did i?
he cried out for the last time, walking away with incredibly long strides
in addition to them, there were the innumerable male and female proteges, whom he had once helped and who for that reason expected to be mentioned in his will
no, smerdyakov is the only one who really knew
(i have forgotten the exact wording)
had sofia known a bit more about his past, she might have turned him down, even in her situation; but everything had taken place in another province and, besides, what judgment could a sixteen-year-old girl make, when all she felt was that she would rather jump in the river than stay with her benefactress?
and now, look at the debauchery among us, at our sensualists
kolya suddenly freed himself from ilyusha’s embrace
touchard assured her in an affected egalitarian tone that he made no distinction between the boys, that all those who attended the school were just like his own children, and that he was like their father, that i was almost on an equal footing with the sons of counts and senators, that she ought to understand and appreciate that, and so on and so forth in that vein
they knew very well what he was driving at and reassured him: no one had spent the night in mr karamazov’s house, except for mr ivan, and everything was all right
i did not have too much to say to him
and you have no right, really, to demand eloquence from a murderer, he added unexpectedly, his mouth twisting as he laughed
well, i will answer for the last time that it's an immense idea and that there's a lot that's new in it
then he set out for town, hoping that on the way he’d somehow manage to settle the problem that was now weighing on him
he screamed like a madman
i can still see you, the way you looked then, i went on, so handsome and the picture of health
how do you say it?
i don’t know, though, it may be in the morning after all
she lived there with her daughter, a former chambermaid, who had worked for a succession of upperclass petersburg families until a year before, when she had been forced to come home to look after her invalid mother, and who liked to go about town in her elegant petersburg dresses
weren’t you aware of that secret?
and so it went until a terrible thing happened: she slipped and fell down some steps—not many steps, only three—which was enough for her to have a miscarriage
at other moments, she spoke as if she felt she were plunging into an abyss, as if she had made up her mind to speak her piece, whatever the consequences
thank you, my dear ones
it must have been the voice of the girl who had rushed out of the room before and run downstairs, i thought
and do you know what—i may not even defend myself at the trial
and just think, there are so many of them over there, under the ground, hammering away
it’s all your fault, they said to me
i’ll come back in the evening, alyosha cried as he rushed out to catch katerina
polenov paid for their upkeep and education out of his own pocket, spending, incidentally, considerably more than a thousand rubles on each boy
besides, it was not to please grushenka that rakitin was taking alyosha to her place, for he was a serious man and never did anything which didn’t have some personal advantage for him
i can see that you’re in a kind of ecstasy—i love such professions de foi from you novices
i want three thousand right now!
), it was not really to save versilov from his madness and give him hack to mother, but rather because
zverev had a nasty scornful smile as he asked me whether something frightened me there
stop it, mrs prutkov, stop torturing me, i went on, like her, ignoring what i did not choose to answer because i was beside myself with worry
of course, he just spat at me, instead of murdering me
well, later, to reward that old friend, i am sure you will be willing to make him a little present for his efforts—say, thirty thousand rubles?—and he will see you through, do not worry!
what a man: here i am kissing his hand and all he has to say is all right
but don’t you think, angelic man, one can tell lies like the one about diderot now and then?
the practical kostya inquired gravely
rakitin frightened me because i thought it was mitya breaking into the house
at least the air is fresh here, and i’m afraid i can’t say the same of the air in my house—i mean that in every sense
it does not look as if they were
nor is it miracles that bring a realist to religion
why, i didn’t say that
particularly, i found none of that peculiar timidity in him that the prosecutor so vividly described
she seemed crushed and it is quite possible that everything had become entangled and mixed up in her head
should i conclude, then, that you only pretended to go along with her because you didn’t wish to hurt her by contradicting, out of compassion for her physical condition?
mitya waited gloomily until the clerk had finished writing and then was about to tell them about his climbing over the fence into his father’s garden, when the examining magistrate suddenly opened a large briefcase that lay next to him on the sofa and drew out the brass pestle
versilov did not believe he would succeed and told him he was sure katerina would never come
he jumped up from the bench
through our mother earth entire
behind her came the maid carrying two candles that she put on the table
so how could he possibly even consider giving me money which would, if anything, strengthen the possibility, when he’s crazy about her himself?
where would he get the necessary money?
but the moment he had finished, he almost fainted
and this time i detected something evil, vicious, and sinister in that grin of his
they told me that he had slashed a boy, krasotkin, with his penknife
and you know what, she prattled on, you absolutely must come back and tell me what you find out, what happens next, what they decide, what sentence he gets, and where he is to serve it
and kalganov went back into the house, sat down in a corner of the entrance hall, covered his face with his hands, and wept
still, i felt it was wrong
two young ladies walked in
so wait for the three thousand
all this burning flow of ideas was being hurled at me in love, but i still could not understand what it was that had suddenly caused him to open up like this and why he would chosen to speak of all people to me
he never left her side; he admired only her; the rest of the world did not exist for him
i’ll pay you for the candle, he said, turning to the forester, and also for spending the night in your hut
it’s not eleven yet, i’m sure
i have an intelligent face, though
there was no one there at the time because mrs fanariotov was traveling abroad
actually, it was more of a foreboding than a thought: i somehow felt that the phrase paper romeo was the keynote in her outburst
i myself gave only one piece of practical advice when andrei versilov asked me a most confidential question without any witnesses present
why are you staring at me like that, saying nothing?
two red lights shone in the darkness and the rattle of the approaching monster increased
finished now—good-by to everything!
you think i’m a vulgar boor?
this homeless old man had stayed at grushenka’s ever since he had returned with her from mokroye two months earlier
i have a gift of premonition—i always feel in advance when something is going to happen and it unfailingly does
i forgot to say that we would got into the habit of having regular evening gatherings
she looked at me unsmilingly, perhaps because of the triviality of my jocular approach
and if he changed and treated you decently, you’d grow cool toward him at once and stop loving him
he’s afraid i’ll give too much of my money to grushenka, if she comes here
we walked all the way to his house in complete silence as i still did not feel like talking to him
for as soon as a man sincerely accepts the idea that he is answerable for the sins of all men, he will realize that that is, indeed, the truth, that he is answerable for everybody and everything
why, of course not
it’d be my fault, because it was me who told you everything!
it's true that the other boys contributed quite a bit to my eventual understanding—it was a good school in that respect
again, of course, he was not there
and so i will just state here plainly and briefly that i accept god
someone started screaming and then suddenly stopped, she told her companions as they ran
then power would no longer be enough; i would give my millions away—not out of boredom or hopeless despair but because i would be seeking something even greater!
do you think bjoring will relish this latest development?
i, for my part, hardly paid any attention at all to maria's absence (reader, please note this too)
i swear this by everything that is holy in this world
i was almost at the gate leading to that yard when i stumbled on versilov
still, i must confess it here, because i believe the time has come for me to do so and i feel it must be recorded
i mean i want to be praised and paid for love with love
it never occurred to me
and so we await the decision that will be dictated by your just heart
he got up and paced the room, looking worried
oh, it's a fact, i do feel so much better!
and you know it very well, i added unexpectedly
might we even say that you were acting unconsciously at the time?
the babe, the coachman said to him, and it struck mitya that he said babe instead of baby
earlier that evening, as soon as he had left, fenya had gone to the head janitor and beseeched him, in the name of christ our lord, not to let the captain in, either tonight or tomorrow
all right, pour me some tea now
armed with spear, the hunter crept,
yes, send for them at once!
he knew he was staring, but he could not take his eyes off her
i was going to his place, but on my way there i saw him outside the plotnikov store
terest and apparently wanted me to go on
i will remember, lisa, that you turned very pale when i told you i was going to fight a duel
you seem to have definitely taken me for a gray-haired version of gogol’s khlestakov, but my function is a much more serious one
had i known of their agreement, i would never have said what i did
there was no lack of warnings and signs, but you chose to ignore them
and he quickly walked out of my room
did you write him a letter?
moreover, i found he had a benevolent attitude toward me and an evenness of temper that i had never expected and, what surprised me most, a kind of gaiety
you’re just paraphrasing your elder
of course, the conservative elements all over the world will be opposed to that declaration because they will be the shareholders and the creditors of the governments
and you must not forget the parables of our lord, taken mostly from st luke (which i used), then the conversion of saul from the acts of the apostles (absolutely without fail), and, finally, the lives of the saints: for instance, the life of alexei, the man of god, and the life of mary of egypt, the greatest of the great, the blessed martyr who saw god, and the bearer of christ
peter miusov, who was later to settle abroad permanently, was at that time still a young man, but he was already an exception among the miusovs: he was an enlightened, big-city gentleman, glittering with foreign polish, a european through and through who, later in life, was to become a typical liberal of the ’s and ’s
well, how did it go?
i lied to you—i like her
finally nelyudov left and mitya’s clothes were carried out after him
the landlord said, guessing at once whom mitya meant
he must be with another woman, laughing at me!
but the next morning he came out of the house looking black as night
oh, i can see that it was rather silly of me, but i was annoyed
and i believe that if this kindliest of men became aware that someone was questioning his sanity in public, that man would become his implacable enemy
i wonder what he’ll say?
but, gentlemen, gentlemen
and also, while on earth, i become superstitious
altogether, she spent only half an hour in town, but the amount she accomplished in that short time was amazing
but the difference lies in the very fact that, in addition to the civil courts of justice, we also have a church that never loses contact with the criminal and treats him like a dear and still beloved son; and also the church in russia does play a role in upholding the law, even if only in people’s minds; for, although the church does not actually sit in judgment over criminals, they fear her condemnation and thus acknowledge her authority
it must be noted here parenthetically that, although katerina was partly responsible for fetyukovich’s coming all the way from petersburg to defend mitya, she had never told him about the five thousand rubles mitya had lent her once and about her prostrating herself before him
don’t worry, doc, my dog won’t bite you, kolya said loudly and angrily, noticing the worried way the doctor kept glancing at perezvon
no one except his flunkey smerdyakov knows about the money, but then father trusts him as he does himself
but that’s perfectly true!
i’m sure i wasn’t laughing at him then, for i remember feeling terribly sorry for him
here, i have a letter for you
although the court has decided to get the case over with as quickly as possible, i would still like to make a few comments, for instance, concerning the public prosecutor’s brilliant character sketch of the late smerdyakov
but now, as i was walking by, i said to myself: 'i will try to drop in on him—he's the kindest of the lot and he was there when it happened
allow me to assure you, she said, that i for one am not laughing at you
but now let's get on with it
attend tirelessly to good works
you yourself, of course, are quite irreplaceable
i could see right away that it hadn’t gone over
but once he had decided to go, he felt that he had a special reason for plunging into a bout of unrestrained drunkenness—to fortify himself for the journey
and i asked myself: do i deserve to be waited on?
i wept and wept and it was the first time i had wept since touchard's school
come to think of it, those few days in moscow may have been the happiest in my life
and somehow it happened that all those who had loved the departed elder and had obediently and devotedly accepted the institution of elders now seemed terribly afraid of something
mitya interrupted him enthusiastically
he even appeared very rarely in church, and this was tolerated in his case because he was considered a simple holy fool, not bound by the monastery rules
how stupid could i be, lisa!
but that was not so in this case
now he comes to you in your dreams and torments you, but if you go back he will send you sweet dreams
he had half the local inhabitants in his clutches, for almost everyone around mokroye owed him something
it is strange, fathers and teachers—although alexei’s face bears only a limited resemblance to my brother’s, i have felt the resemblance in spirit to be so great that to me he has often been that other boy, my brother, coming to me mysteriously as i reach the end of my journey, to remind me of the past and to inspire me
i am not asking for the reader's advice; i am simply trying to relive that moment of anxiety and i am looking in vain for an explanation of what made me suddenly plunge behind the curtain into mrs prut-kov's bedroom
do you like it?
who said anything about helping
but he paid no attention to what i said and kept staring into my eyes
and his heart caught fire and turned toward a light; he wanted to live now, to live and to walk on and on toward that unknown light that was beckoning to him; he had to start quickly, quickly, right away!
and where did you get the needle and thread from?
later, when asked to give an estimate of the sum dmitry was carrying with him then, mr perkhotin said that it was hard to tell at a glance but that he would not be surprised if there was as much as two or even three thousand rubles, for what he saw was certainly a pretty thick wad of bills
but tell me this now: how large was that bundle with the bills in it that you had around your neck?
i want to get it straight: crime must be considered not only as admissible but even as the logical and inevitable consequence of an atheist’s position
to this day, they are all convinced that the atheist diderot went to see the metropolitan platon to argue with him about god
do you know him?
i must confess i would not at all like to be a novelist who has to deal with a hero coming from an accidental family!
he must come back here
in short, there was a lot of talk going around
yes, you were certainly counting on mr dmitry
could you let me have five rubles?
repentance and despair are two very different things
he had in his hand a small but obviously expensive bouquet of fresh flowers
this is a quirk found in many people, even very clever ones, let alone the likes of fyodor karamazov
i certainly intend to go through with it, my boy
oh, forgive me, for i see the pained expression on your face, so please forgive this over enthusiastic adolescent for his clumsy way of saying what he feels
so do not let russia down, do not disappoint her expectations, for the troika of our fate may be carrying us headlong to our doom!
one of them shouted
you cannot be received just now
it should be added that karamazov was not only convinced of smerdyakov’s honesty—he was even fond of him somehow, although smerdyakov made no exception for him, looking at him with the same jaundiced eye as he looked at the rest of the world and seldom saying anything to him
no, no, nothing will force me to do that!
i have just been to his place and that's why i have come to you in such a state, shaking all over
being just an unimaginative small-time criminal, he had blindly based all his calculations on the document, without bothering to try to understand what sort of person he was dealing with
this is the age of railroads, mr karamazov
i myself believe that it will come to pass and that the time is near at hand
but it’s up to you, really
and i never suspected it
no, i do not need it
yet when before burial his coffin stood in a church where he was already venerated as a saint, a strange thing happened: as soon as the deacon began to intone, depart, all ye possessed by the devil, the coffin rose into the air and was hurled out of the church
why, i know he somehow found out i had some money and so came rushing here to marry me
had not i imagined all the things that tormented me so?
of course i wouldn’t!
on both of us,
well, that’s something a martyr would ask
hot and cold waves flooded his body in turns
it’s a direct, spontaneous loathing
they apparently were under the impression that what had happened could still be changed and undone
i’d bet anything that it’s occurred to you before this
the next witness to be called was ivan karamazov
but i was sobbing myself as i told her
i will try now to sum up what followed
so this was the sequence of thoughts that passed through my head since i was completely sincere with myself
why should an author forego even one listener, after all?
my theory, karamazov, is plain and clear, kolya started off in a hurry again
they were also very interested to hear that it was smerdyakov who kept mitya informed of what went on inside old karamazov’s house, and the clerk had to write it all down in detail
so he gives me one of those dumb looks and says: and what does a goose think about?
my god,  i thought, if he comes now and just whistles for me, i’ll crawl to him, cringing like a beaten dog
my heart contracted painfully when i heard that
silence is always beautiful and a silent man is always more pleasing to the eye than a talking man
ah, gentlemen, don’t you understand that precisely the purpose makes the whole difference?
how dare you
somehow it had never occurred to me that makar might not be alone, and now i was quite taken aback to find mother and the doctor there
kraft did not know what had actually happened to that letter but remarked that andronikov would never have torn up such an important paper since he was a man not only with a broad mind but also with a broad notion of the permissible—a judgment showing surprising independence, in view of kraft's close attachment to and fondness for andronikov
i love him and i asked that he be brought in so you could have a look at him
i fully intend to make everybody laugh
i’m really surprised at your patience with these people—one can never trust them!
and to these questions he receives the stereotyped answer: he gave you life, you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you must love him
but hardly had the boy uttered these words than maxim appeared on top of the bank above them
in fact, i liked the way you put it about a woman wielding tremendous power, although i am not sure why you had to connect it with her working or not
but, anyway, they won’t allow her to follow me there
there were also in him certain traits that seemed contradictory: side by side with his unbelievable trust, which, to my great exasperation at times, prevented him from detecting irony, there was a certain slyness, which showed up particularly during our arguments
he was at once surrounded by people, who never took their eyes off him
in any case, allow me to regard you as my best friends at this moment of my life when i am in this humiliating position
zosima, placing the stole on her head, said a brief prayer, and the girl immediately quieted down
yes, i am nothing but a wretched adolescent who every minute keeps losing the sense of what's good and what's bad
did you tell him?
besides, i have the weakness of talking without elaborating
but as alyosha stood up, mr karamazov changed his mind
so when he lay sick, i looked at him and i said to myself: if he gets better, he’ll get up and then what?
i must leave in time to visit my brother, alyosha mumbled apologetically
and, for some reason, at first i took a sort of liking to the young man, just like the rest of them
i’ll even think that it’s a beautiful exit for a man like me
he was an illegitimate child and when he was only six years old his parents gave him as a present to some shepherds in the swiss mountains, who took him to make him work for them
but now, if dardanelov’s name happened to come up in conversation with visitors in kolya’s presence, the poor woman would blush like a rose while kolya would pointedly look out of the window, or examine his boots to see if they needed repairing, or impatiently call perezvon, a large, shaggy, mangy dog which he had found somewhere a month before and had kept secretly at home, for some reason not wanting any of his schoolmates to see it
and yet we all knew him—for among us he lived,  as the poet said
such people as you and i—how could we hold on to money?
that is my private life, gentlemen, and cannot be any of your concern, i mean what goes on deep down inside me
and with this so that’s it, mitya rested his absurd plea
you’ll be the first person i’ve told it to, except, of course, for ivan, for he knows everything and knew it all long before you
and wait, if you must, you may reduce the price from eleven thousand to ten, but no lower than that
he suggests you mail the money to your sister yourself, and he sends you his best regards
and since he didn’t do it, it must have been
all that is delirium, he said, because there is no such thing as god
thank you, sir, i’ll be sure to do it
i heard nashchokin telling prince sergei, whom he would come to visit this morning
his features were twisted into a crazy, questioning smile
it was evident that he would come to see us with the purest intentions
i’ll always come and see you, as long as i live, alyosha said firmly
he had merely been given a table by a window that was screened off from the rest of the dining room so that they could not be seen by the other customers
for instance, he would stand for hours at the window of his cell and watch the children playing in the prison yard
even mother is not in on the secret
i would be so happy if you could talk to me about something else
his wife begged him and begged him with tears in her eyes:
you see, arkady, if i would called you here before, what could i have said to you?
lise shouted now in real alarm
the hell with you, i said, pushing his finger away
and i’m coming with you
i jumped up from my chair in indignation
you’re beginning to get on my nerves, rakitin!
and because of this, i feel i will have to insist that you answer the following question: what is the basis for your absolute belief in your brother’s innocence and in the guilt of another person, whom you named at the preliminary investigation?
probably at first, he found the shorter pole comical, but soon he conceived a violent aversion for him, as bilious and liverish people are often prone to do without any provocation
hey, he’s fainted again
no, wait a minute, not the father of lies—i always get my quotations mixed up—well, let’s say the son, and that’s good enough
and now, gentlemen, please be seated
you know, alyosha, i’m particularly afraid of your brother mitya today, grushenka said
i got up from the sofa, deciding that eavesdropping was despicable, and took my old place by the window
i don’t believe he loved anyone but himself, and he also had a very inflated opinion of his own talents
pauvre enfant, i doubt that it would be such a boon for her
come, see him off as he is about to vanish into the darkness
mon ami, voila dolgorovki, i'autre mon ami!
the karamazov drive—the vile, earthly drive
love god’s creation, love every atom of it separately, and love it also as a whole; love every green leaf, every ray of god’s light; love the animals and the plants and love every inanimate object
he most certainly did!
through the half-opened door, i suddenly caught sight of someone emerging from behind the curtain that separated mrs prutkov's bed from the rest of the room
and, of course, i cannot expect you to pat me on the back for what i did to gregory, for one cannot be allowed to go around breaking old men’s heads with impunity
but she lost her head in her fear and swore ignorance; she believes that if the accused did not kill her then and there, it was only because he was in too much of a hurry to catch up with her mistress, who had deceived him
i drove to see my sister anna versilov
you’ve heard about that doctor, haven’t you?
and i knew you knew i would come
i felt as if that letter had been written in blood, a sort of unhealthy blood
try to understand that finally!
actually, it's better this way because she loves you too
the way i am, i don’t mind jealousy
the conscientious jury go out and come back with a verdict of not guilty
you were the strongest boy in school
is not it just
kolya, if you say one more word, i will never have anything to do with you again!
i need hardly speak of the artisans and laborers, because in our agricultural town such people are quite indistinguishable from peasants, and artisans often even till the soil
i felt like hugging and kissing him, but i didn’t dare—his face was all twisted and his gaze was somber
when i first saw you, i decided that your face looked unnecessarily hard and uncommunicative
there’s something spiteful and at the same time sincere about you, alyosha said with a smile
ordering his driver to wait for him, he hurried back to the monastery, and went straight to the father superior’s rooms
keep quiet, now, that’s enough!
you come from tradespeople, don’t you?
do they have some kind of ironworks down there, or what?
and although he had been up since early morning and had tried to convince himself that he felt fine, he looked weak and tired
indeed, i hate them all!
he finally said, as if doing the boy a tremendous honor just by acknowledging his existence
he felt a special tremor in his heart and he radiated joy when the elder went out to the gates of the monastery to meet a group of humble folk who had flocked there from all over russia to see him and ask for his blessing
because you yourself have given me so much happiness during this past hour!
a satisfied gleam flashed in versilov's eye
ah, nikolai, my husband, how have i displeased you?
the butler went out and half a minute later returned to show the visitor in
so you wanted to find out, i see
there was another possible outcome, though, a tragic one
i remember that room clearly and must emphasize that it was not one of mrs prutkov's rooms, for this is important in view of what follows
there were sounds suggesting a struggle and the panting words no, no, i do not want to
tell me and don’t lie!
but alyosha said nothing
tomorrow at dawn, when the sun rises, mitya karamazov will jump over that fence
and what would become of the criminal, o lord, if the christian community, that is, the church, rejected him and cut him off as the law of the state does?
you must not forget her either
all right then, tell me why i am so good
all that affected me too and, once again, i decided not to protest
he broke off as if he was having difficulty in controlling his breathing
when i heard of it, i was so amazed that i almost sent someone to call you
i know stepan heard it, and semyon did too
but, my god, what can i do about your eyes?
that’s true, i said, everything is good and beautiful because everything is truth
just show yourself in his doorway
and he was a great saint and cannot have told her an untruth
and, you know, we’re not friends
i think to myself, may the lord grant them the higher stipend that is so important to them (because their complaint is justified), but the truth is that, if someone is to blame, we must share in that blame ourselves
i am afraid i must agree with you, vasin, but i prefer the way i understood it at first
yes, that last thought sprang up in my mind by itself, without my noticing it almost
then i heard the loud and unrestrained voice of a man just outside vasin's door
you want to have your bodyguard with you?
there would be nothing unnatural, evil, in it: you are worried about that document, you suspect that such and such a person knows something about it, and you wish to find out what he knows
when she straightened up, she was beaming
for the last time, mr karamazov, miusov warned him again hurriedly in a threatening whisper, remember your promise to behave—or i’ll make you pay for it!
there were also some amusing stories about our public prosecutor and our presiding judge
the clothes he wore were very shabby: an old ill-fitting quilted overcoat with a mangy raccoon collar that was much too short for him and was obviously secondhand, heavy workingman's boots, and a horribly battered ancient top-hat that had acquired a rust-colored tinge
alyosha asked him in considerable surprise
and although i’m sure there’ll be times when i’ll desperately want to eavesdrop on you, i’ll never do so, because you think eavesdropping is low
all i know is that the man in question was much closer to you than you admitted to me, i said, not quite sure myself what i meant by that, but i felt i was frowning and there was deep reproach in my tone
and you know what —you are not really quite as repulsive a character as you may seem at first glance
you’re a coachman, aren’t you?
i felt it every time i thought of them, and it was that feeling that told me that what had happened was not good
this, however, never bothered him, for he had always considered his mastery of the russian language exemplary and his use of it more correct than that of native russians
some people pick out from books nothing but the little flowers, and even then only those that suit them, but they still remain restless because they could never make up their minds in the first place
and it’s quite impossible to dissuade him
alyosha told ivan that, a little more than an hour before, maria kondratievna had come running over to his lodgings to tell him that smerdyakov had killed himself
another boy put in
you gathered at once that i knew something—you could not have failed to
that's why i had to see you first
that is why the idea of service to mankind and brotherly love has been dying out in the world; indeed, now it is often sneered at, for what can a man do who has become the slave of the innumerable needs and habits he has invented for himself?
and if the discarded envelope was lying on the floor, why can’t we come to just the opposite conclusion—namely, that the fact that the torn envelope was found on the floor shows that its owner had thrown it away after removing the money from it?
but suddenly she seemed to become frightened, as though she would caught sight of a line that could not be overstepped, and she cut me off:
i felt it coming, but just then peter perkhotin came in
these words descended on me with a dreadful heaviness
don’t pay any attention to him, alyosha said quickly, frowning
i couldn’t help it, sir; in fact, i tried very hard to stay out of it, if you want to know the truth
i want you to know everything
well then, just imagine, perhaps i, too, accept god, ivan said laughingly
tell me, are they very angry with him?
indeed, she pounced on me these days more than ever, at the slightest provocation or even without one
you don’t know about it, my dear alexei, but we’ve had a whole plot hatched here, all of us—both her aunts, myself, and even lise—and for a whole month we’ve been doing our utmost and praying that she should break with your favorite brother dmitry, who doesn’t love her and doesn’t even want to have anything to do with her
he was also very fond of the boy, although he would have considered it undignified, in view of the circumstances, to try and gain his affection and he was always strict and demanding with him in class
granted, this man is a monster, but i no longer dare assert that his is an exceptional case nowadays
i have the impression that something has remained unsaid here, something is still unfinished
then i went to the kitchen and prepared two tremendous mustard plasters for her
then, still without explanation, she went to gregory’s cottage where she found the two little boys
gentlemen, mitya started, still in the same state of great agitation, that money, gentlemen—i’ll make a clean breast of it—well, that money belonged to me
i suppose i have a few sins of that sort on my conscience
he asked me at one point
what's come over him now?
i ran after them downstairs, coatless and hatless
so the first signal—five knocks altogether—means miss grushenka has arrived,  the second signal—three knocks—something urgent to report
if i have an opportunity later i will relate how anna—usually so proud and proper—had made up her mind to see the baby and how she would met lisa on that occasion
so where do i come in here?
young people are the mainstay of our suffering russia, her only hope
but now you must go to see those you promised
she was leaning limply against him and he was supporting her firmly with his arm
don’t you understand—that way he’d get, not twenty-three hundred rubles, but four thousand; he might even have made six thousand on the deal!
oh, you are so impatient, doctor!
within twenty-four hours i can come to hate the best of men, perhaps because he eats too slowly or because he has a cold and keeps blowing his nose
the doctor followed his example and mrs prutkov jumped to her feet too
i stood there answering the way a soldier on parade ground would answer an officer
about a month before the disaster, miss verkhovtsev gave the accused three thousand rubles to mail for her
you know, it’s funny, i suddenly decided to bang that signal on the window frame, the one meaning, she’s here
a really wonderful story!
why should it stir up such amazement and horror in us, who have seen everything and have become used to everything?
add to this a long, carnivorous mouth with puffy lips and the black stumps of almost completely decayed teeth, from which saliva sprayed every time he opened his mouth to speak
so i did not answer his question what shares?
she walked up and down the room for a while and suddenly declared: 'i want to lodge a complaint against that creature, i will take her to courtl' i said nothing, only thinking what good could that possibly do and how would she prove her charge
because cet homme noir
your words are frightening, blessed and reverend father, the visitor said, shaking his head
and you know what?
when most people laugh, they uncover their hidden vulgarity and thus demean themselves, although they seldom realize the painful impression their laughter produces on others
for my part, i’ve long since stopped worrying about who invented whom—god man or man god
of course, some of the men in the audience appeared to be perfectly cheerful and quite indifferent to what would happen to mitya personally, although they were extremely interested in the trial itself
actually, i said, that's not where i live
you’re going to perform a virtuous deed, although you don’t believe in virtue, and that’s what annoys and torments you and makes you so vengeful’—that’s what he said about me and he knows
furthermore, even if such a time never did come, since god and immortality still would not exist, the new man might become the man-god, even if he were the only one in the whole world, and, of course, in that new capacity, he might, if the need arose, jump without scruple over every barrier of the old moral code devised for the man-slave
you are laughing at me yourself now!
besides, if i am not mistaken, you have already told it to other people
he knows more than anyone else on any subject, papa
the stock of these notions is, by the way, quite limited and some of them may also be dangerous
have you ever dreamt of falling from a mountain straight into a deep hole?
no, he said, it is not exaggerated
grushenka asked with alarm
watching what was going on, i somehow suddenly thought it was ivan she loved, so i said those stupid things
but since maria has not told even you about it, she probably has not got it
he went on insisting that she should fasten his friend's tie and that she should give him one of lambert's clean shirt collars
was he hoping that dmitry karamazov would make enough noise, wake up witnesses, and bring them to the scene of the murder, and then he, smerdyakov, would get up and follow them (well, he would have to get up then, that couldn’t be helped!
but i have known of him for a very long time and he has played a certain part in my life too
yes, i knew of you by reputation and i did think of you
this legend now, it’s about heaven
what do you say of versilov, eh?
well, in that case you’d better wash it off, perkhotin said
when the presiding judge asked the accused to comment on this latest testimony, mitya confirmed everything, said that he had, indeed, been pointing at the fifteen hundred rubles he had hidden under his shirt, that he had felt disgraced by it, a disgrace i will not deny now, the most contemptible act of my whole life
he felt it would be awkward to go into the inn in his cassock, but he could inquire downstairs whether his brothers were there and ask them to come down to see him
my heart is better than my head?
she didn’t forgive me
but it is the absolute truth
did i really want it, though, did i?
you ran down an old woman?
sergei was very agitated
then i suddenly thought (i swear i did): why should i have to go on like this?
i wanted to make him feel better
so something special must have happened and miss sapozhkov wound up the loser (or, in my opinion, the winner)
i had slept exceptionally soundly and without dreams, a fact i find surprising
as long as i suspected you of perfidy and crude flirtatiousness, i was unhappy because i could not associate these qualities with you
but what struck me most later—i emphasize that it was only later and not at the beginning—was makar's impressive physique
he clasped his hands together, abandoning himself to his inner terror
after stealing the letter from me, lambert had immediately contacted versilov
the blood rushed to his cheeks, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered
i noticed how energetic everybody around me seemed
that give her hope?
who am i to defend you?
the prosecutor wanted to know further
he was finishing his breakfast and was about to leave when i arrived
that day, when grushenka had insulted katerina and mitya had heard of it from alyosha, he had admitted his despicable act to alyosha and asked him to tell katerina about it, if that would make her feel any better
but is it all right if i stay like this, sitting on your lap, for a while?
ah, i wish it was juchka instead!
i can see you still despise me
this whole intrigue depressed me horribly, but i somehow felt i could not just cut anna down and leave her there
but this point will have to be cleared up eventually, and we have all the time in the world
fetyukovich bowed, said he had finished, and went back to his seat, accompanied by an approving hum from the spectators
it is a fact that i have lied all my life, every day and every hour
he’s not a man to do a thing like that!
i have absolutely no desire to land in the hands of the secret service and then learn lessons by the chain bridge
so tell me, how can i make myself most useful right now?
i have talent, there's nothing i ca not do
how could i help it?
ah, she who was so honest and truthful, and i, a blackmailing spy trying to take advantage of a compromising document!
to my surprise, stebelkov already knew everything about anna down to the last detail
anyway, a soldier has to know how to sew
and don’t tell ivan either
i want us to have a baby boy together and if we succeed that will mean that the boy has forgiven us both, you and me
rakitin just laughs and says that one can love mankind without god
good god, i’m completely appalled at your lack of understanding!
that's how i felt then
these women, you can never rely on them
but wait, i have two thousand myself and ivan will give you a thousand
when i was on the way from moscow to petersburg, i dreamed of you all night in the train
i just got there and he was already dead
i took it from around my neck, right here!
here is the hermitage at last, mr karamazov announced, but the gates are shut
i accepted the handkerchief, although i was about to protest that monsieur and madame touchard provided perfectly for all our needs and that we really lacked nothing
love for a father that the father has not deserved is inconceivable and absurd
nowadays people do not give a damn about general principles but are only concerned with their own particular cases
obviously, i decided not to answer them because it was out of the question for me to exchange abuse with flunkeys
give it to me!
to versilov, for instance, i still spoke like a friend, although with reservations, but whenever one of us would let himself go a little (and this did happen), we would at once both draw back as if ashamed of something
and now if someone who had failed to buy that stock saw some of those shares in my hands and offered to buy them off me at so many points above the official rate, well, i would not hesitate to sell them to him at once
what was he thinking when he told him that?
he was in a great hurry, answered abruptly and very strangely, but at certain moments did not sound at all like an unhappy man; indeed, he seemed rather gay
i bowed to her in silence and walked out of the room, not daring to look at her
she clasped her hands prayerfully, overwhelmed by emotion
it must be pointed out that, when gregory made his appearance in court, he was not in the least awed by the solemnity of the occasion or the size of the audience
it’s not just that it could be he—it is he!
perhaps it will work and if not
he told them how he had climbed over the fence into his father’s garden, how he had stood under his father’s window, and all that had happened there
i mean, i wo not feel offended, because it would be only natural, i understand all too well
my voice failed me, but i whispered the words firmly
you have now provided yourself with what we may call a scrupulous account of the first eventful and dangerous steps on the road of your life
in our society today nothing is clear, gentlemen
i always snort with disgust when i meet one of them
they really humiliated him
and it goes without saying that they never questioned their right to treat him like that or felt guilty about it, because, after all, richard had been given them as a present, like an inanimate object, and they didn’t imagine they could have any obligations even to feed him
since you have come out of charity, do something charitable and answer me one question
their faces reflected a hysterical, greedy, almost morbid curiosity
but i still wonder how the stupid young dog approached my mother
ivan felt as if there were a sort of thick fog inside him, but he looked eagerly at the fields stretched out around him, at the hilly countryside, at the trees, at a flock of geese flying high overhead across the clear sky
and take my word for it: the public would believe me and it’d mean shame and disgrace for you to the end of your life
i want to know everything!
for a few seconds mitya was like a man stunned
and i submit that the prosecutor can find no one else to suspect only because he had, from the start, arbitrarily decided not to suspect smerdyakov
the rest of the room was packed with people, but they were not the people who had been at the party, but others quite different
and then he suddenly conceived the following idea: the man is dead and now i can save my brother by shifting the blame for the murder onto smerdyakov
no, gentlemen, i am too embarrassed to do so, so you’ll just have to excuse me!
would you really be so awfully kind, madam!
do you realize what a great honor that is for you?
he dropped exhausted onto the sofa
he was looking questioningly at perkhotin, as though waiting for him to decide what mitya was to do with his own money
well, i do not really know whom i was jealous of
can you conceive, gentlemen, that, having obtained money in such a shameful, degrading, and humiliating way, a man like the accused could, on the very day he had got hold of the money, set half the sum aside and sew it up in a rag, and then have the firmness of character to carry it around his neck for a whole month, despite all temptations to spend it and despite his urgent need for money?
and this is the most important difference between us and all the others, for we are different from the rest
and the same pattern was maintained with all the more dangerous witnesses
otherwise, he spoke in a low, tired voice and was in a very weak state
i feel pretty certain that the spectators, the ladies especially, were quite satisfied with the spectacle: it was, indeed, a choice one
when we’re through with all this comedy here, when they decide on the sentence, i’ll tell you something then
the boys said, laughing
he's some kind of clerk in a lawyer's office
everything was clear anyway: so it was that officer, and mitya had known about him all along from grushenka herself, who had even told mitya that she had received a letter from him a month ago
in the letter, he gave her his solemn word of honor that she had nothing to fear
feeling her intense gaze constantly following him, alyosha felt impelled by some irresistible force and was unable to prevent himself from quickly glancing at her from time to time
but, for that matter, versilov did not go around looking for somebody to lend him money, although at times he would be out all day
as to the weapon—well, it could have been, for instance, a rock, as long as it was heavy enough; he could have picked it up in the garden before going in
on that particular day i had come to the meeting full of magnanimity, although i was perhaps somewhat ridiculous at the same time
but i want you to understand, gentlemen of the jury, that the only reason i have dabbled in psychology here is to demonstrate to you that you can use it to arrive at whatever conclusions suit you best
you were trying to sell me to him and he slapped your face!
at that very second all hell seemed to have broken loose in the entrance hall
and so i got all the way to the crossroads
we have other things to do than joke with you, nelyudov snapped back
dmitry said in strange exaltation
she told me she had come
but i ca not believe that a man would do something like that just for show
nevertheless, for the first few minutes i understood absolutely nothing
and while there is still time, i want to dissociate myself from it all; i have no wish to be a part of their eternal harmony
i did not like him very much, did not like him at all, in fact
but he was no longer listening
all of a sudden he looked very drunk
then, however, things become more complicated
he was so pleased with himself when he came in that he did not even attempt to hide it
we’re better off having some people as enemies than as friends
tell me, my good fellow, what did you mean the other day when, as i was leaving after visiting you in the hospital, you said that if i didn’t mention your ability to sham epileptic fits, you, for your part, wouldn’t tell the examining magistrate all the rest of our talk by the gate’?
well, that’s just the trouble—i have no witnesses
why don’t you order the square swept tomorrow?
that's a good wish, he said firmly
when, after that, he described the moment when he had seen his father’s face peering out of the window and, overwhelmed by loathing, had pulled the pestle out of his pocket, he deliberately cut his story short and sat there staring at the wall, knowing that their eyes were still fixed on him
i will see what comes of it, i said to myself
i expected her to burst into tears, but she did something else
what i have just said is only part of what a true father ought to be
he admits it to everybody—that is, not to everybody, but to every intelligent visitor who comes to see him
can’t you give me a rough idea?
it’s twelve below freezing
'there's no room for a bitch like you in a respectable establishment like ours!
bring him here,  she said, meaning you
and shall i tell you something, my boy?
that idea crushed him completely
they hire out horses there too
what are you talking about?
the fanatic screamed, quite impervious to reason in his zeal for denunciation
but no sooner had she walked out than the old man's face changed
and i also know very well that sergei could not possibly take such a 'promise' seriously
i agree that there's no need for us to throw ourselves into each other's arms, but, without going that far, could not we part with mutual respect, for instance?
all i did was listen to her tell me about her love for him
someone will have to take it back home to her
in fact, i would made up my mind to cut all communications with them and to move out of there as soon as i could
but the most daring crimes are often the most successful
would you be so kind as to tell us exactly how you got it?
sweetness of her breast enjoy
you know, only yesterday i was thinking: 'who will be the most happy for me?
they seemed to spend their time sitting there and waiting for something
if you wish, i can give you a letter for him
will we manage to get used to it?
a dead silence followed, after which the foreman of the jury—the youngest of the four civil servants—spoke out loudly and clearly in the stillness of the courtroom:
i guess it would be easier to go through with it on a morning like this, he thought
very sorry, my boy
but in actual fact, as i said, i knew nothing until everything was over
i never went in
the presiding judge made a sign
then some began to criticize openly the recently deceased elder, and even to make accusations against him
i saw him yesterday
and she was there, asleep by his side
and he acted in that way because he was dmitry karamazov and not smerdyakov, because he did not calculate, and was certainly not in a state to think clearly: he was in too much of a hurry to get away from there!
well, i like you even without brandy, but with wicked schemers i’m a wicked schemer myself
he had real pangs of guilt
and all that because i had once praised you aloud
it's so pleasant to look at you today
her cheeks were very thin, almost sunken, and her forehead was already heavily lined
that should be pretty obvious to anyone and any reader with imagination will appreciate how tired i am of having to offer all these repetitive explanations and apologies, which i am even forced to squeeze into the stream of my narrative!
you said that living life' is something simple and spontaneous, something that stares us straight in the face, and, because of its directness and obviousness, we cannot believe ourselves that it is precisely what we have been looking for all our lives
she hurried to the janitor, who by then had been awakened and was on his way to the gate, and begged him not to open it
please, prince, you mus not worry like this
and if i’ve had some doubts of late, they’re gone now as i sit here, expecting to hear words of great wisdom
what had made him forget the very existence of that officer almost as soon as he had first heard about him?
mrs khokhlakov hurried out
when we got up, i went over to mother, put my arm around her, and kissed her warmly, wishing her a happy birthday
would you believe me if
will you allow me, madam, to call my dog in here?
finally he returns to town, exhausted, hungry, feeling that he has been made a fool of
i have no strength to bear it!
and after that, all day long, it was disaster after disaster for mr karamazov
quickly, alexei, give me back the letter i sent you yesterday—hurry, because mother will be back any moment now and i don’t want
i realize now that i still know nothing about it, but if i have found out anything at all, it's how much i love you, lisa
besides, after i advised you to go, you could have either left or stayed
i think you even look outraged
i’ll have them carry me into the courtroom in an armchair, for i’m quite capable of sitting up; besides, there will be somebody with me to assist me
waiting for him to come to see you?
at the same time, i assure you, i knew she could see my failings better than anyone else and, in general, i have never met a woman with a more perspicacious and subtle understanding
lisa hardly smiled when she saw me, mother was obviously ill at ease, and although versilov did give me a smile, it was a rather forced one
my dear, kind, and generous adviser, my only friend in the world, ivan karamazov, who possesses a profound knowledge of the human heart, approves that decision and has praised me for making it
for instance, about seven years ago, i arrived in a small town where i was trying to set up a little business deal in partnership with some small local businessmen
i seized his hand
what was to be done about it?
i used to sit here, hiding myself from people
listen, karamazov, i’ll explain the whole thing to you and that’s why, in fact, i had you called outside—i wanted to tell you before we went inside
no sooner was the accused arrested than he tried to put the whole blame on smerdyakov
within a short time he opened a number of new taverns in the district
ah, what poor judgment on my part!
you were just tossing money about for no reason and they were picking it up
it's not right for you to talk like that
he still did not believe it when he walked away free
i should really say more about him, but i am ashamed to impose any more stories of common servants on my readers
very soon katerina divined his secret
i am aware of that already, the man snapped, anxious to let alyosha know unmistakably that he knew who he was
the painter kramsky has a remarkable painting called the contemplator: a road with a wintry forest in the background and on the road, wearing a ragged coat and felt shoes, stands a lonely, forlorn peasant who has lost his way, and who seems to be thinking hard about something, but is actually not thinking at all, but just contemplating
i’ll see new places and never look back
he was old enough to receive communion
he was talking and she was listening to him with great deference and intentness
i do not wish to enlarge too much on mr versilov himself, but, after all, he is a member of the russian landed gentry and comes from an old, distinguished family
well, i guess you were just drunk
but then it turned out that my articulation had been considerably clearer than i would assumed and hoped
in fact, he was interested in what i had to say and at times listened eagerly as i held forth on all sorts of subjects; for, although i was just a young'un (as he said even though he was perfectly aware that the proper word was youth), he always remembered that this particular young'un was incomparably better educated than himself
oh, they are in a hurry to love in order to stifle the great sadness in their hearts
and it is him that the angels serve
but it was all so strange and incongruous that i did not even know what to think of it
but ivan had become strangely undemanding in the past two months; above all, he was anxious not to have anyone about him
our work is only beginning, but at least it has begun
when they reached gregory in the garden, the two women and foma carried him to the cottage
wait, perhaps you will understand
but he was no longer capable of such clear thought
when he got to his room, he felt as though icy fingers were clutching at his heart, a reminder of something painful and repulsive that was connected precisely with this room, that had been here, and that was here now at this very moment
i suppose that darzan knows now, at least judging from his tone last night
but then, if he’s sitting and waiting for me there, at least he won’t come here and that’s good
what do i think?
that's what i decided back in moscow
whatever else he is, he's not one of those puppets but a real man who reminds me rather of someone whom we both know very well
the most irritating thing about it was that the anxiety seemed completely accidental, external, as if it had nothing to do with him
the landlady again appeared at the end of the corridor and stebelkov quickly ran to her on tiptoe
we have come to you, great healer, to express our fervent gratitude
kolya boasted that he could do it
that thought had fascinated me while i was still in moscow and had grown even stronger in the train carrying me to petersburg, as i have confessed earlier
you may rest assured of that, but it will not happen immediately, because everything that happens in the world is controlled by its own set of laws
alyosha came running at once
do you get it now?
i can only assume that she was irritated by the insulting curiosity with which she was stared at by all those people, so eager for gossip and scandal
where did you see it?
but we shall come back to it
having come to the club alone and finding myself surrounded by strangers, i installed myself at a corner of the table and began staking small sums
yes, because they do not dress decently
she's a greek statue of minerva, with the only difference that she can walk and wears fashionable clothes
yesterday ivan talked sense about these things, although we were all pretty drunk
as things stood, the old prince, under the pretext that it was good for his health, had been whisked off to tsarskoe
he was a disgrace
well, in the evening i took my son out for a walk
you see, we’ve come here on private business, miusov said sternly
you’re a fool, fellow, that’s what you are
i remember the final composition of the jury: of the twelve, four were government officials, two were merchants, and six were artisans and laborers
she was, of course, that hysterical girl i would met earlier in the day
ignoring his wife’s frightened and hysterical protests that they were the cries of her little baby calling her, gregory went into the garden
and in the meantime, during the night, you decided to have a good time—is that right?
it was she who made me understand—oh, not directly but plainly enough, god knows—that the very idea of marriage between us was now impossible
alyosha frowned, realizing that he had stumbled on some other visitors, but at that moment the portiere was raised and katerina came in
why did he tell him all that?
i was late for dinner, but they had waited for me and were not at the table yet
then i’ll kill
the idea is the main thing, everything in fact
would you like me to prove to you that i am not 'your good baron?
the city itself had aroused very little interest in him and, although he learned something there, he paid little attention to the rest
the ceremony, as you know, will have to take place here, in the prison chapel
i bet that he's sitting right now in that inn, listening to 'lucia
they’ve started a card game, timofei said
well, not more than five days ago, in a company consisting mostly of ladies of our town, he solemnly declared, in the course of a discussion, that there was nothing on earth to force men to love their fellow men, that there was no law of nature that a man should love mankind, and that if there was love on earth it did not stem from any natural law but rather from man’s belief in immortality
he spoke slowly, articulating his words clearly, but without rudeness
i blurted out unintentionally
he appeared on the scene when she was in deep despair, when she was disconsolate after having been deserted by the man she loved
although i had never heard any of these legends before, i am sure there was much in them he would changed or invented because for the most part he would heard them himself from simple, illiterate folk
how can i leave you like this, though?
tell me everything
so they condemned him for that
your answer to whom?
i don’t want anything, sir, nothing important; we were just talking, sir
he will never be able to endure pain for the sake of his cause
he walked with the long, firm stride of a military man
above all, i resolved never to go all out for a maximum immediate gain, but always to remain cool
they had been in our town for a week already, having come on business rather than for devotions
so, as with his first marriage, he asked the girl to elope with him
he’s like a cloud of dust: the wind will blow and he’ll be gone
karamazov said again after a two-minute silence
so why do not you go and dance?
so that’s how she feels,  i thought
and, you know, she would have drowned herself if that old merchant hadn’t stopped her then
people in the tavern had heard him, when drunk, declare angrily that one day he would kill her
mitya put his hand out and touched it
but you were not a bit angry at what i said; you took my advice as if it came from a good friend, and left
mitya roared with laughter
i can’t believe it!
you see, alyosha, my boy, i’ll tell you frankly—every self-respecting man is bound to land under the heel of some woman at one time or another
why did you lie to him and say they flog us?
master’ll beat me with a rope,
possibly he was quite ingenuous about it all
i took the bills
i said, hoping to resume our previous night’s talk
the sun was so red as it rolled down the horizon and the sky looked awfully cold and the wickedly biting wind was raising clouds of dust just like today
my comrade-in-arms kept looking at me and saying approvingly: that’s the spirit
it was the landlord of this apartment, anna put him straight, who's a very amusing man and who seems to know so many amusing stories
we will pass over the little speech the examining magistrate made to each new witness about how it was his duty to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, and that he would have to repeat it all under oath later and, moreover, every witness would have to sign his present deposition
remember, you even laughed ut me because i read newspapers at the rate of two a day
did you hear about the arrest of all those young people on the petersburg side yesterday?
although i held a second lieutenant’s rank in that battalion of the line regiment, i was under a sort of permanent surveillance, like a former convict or something
within a minute snegirev returned
for a few seconds dmitry stood there like a man stunned by a blow
many times i’ve asked myself whether there is anything in the world that could crush my frantic, indecent appetite for life, and have decided that it looks as though nothing of the sort exists
he definitely said no to that
who cares whether you are worried or not!
i dashed past the landlord, who somehow happened to be around again, slipped into my room, bolted my door, and, without relighting my candle, threw myself onto my bed
i admit that i too wept a little, but that was because i suddenly felt so awfully sorry for him
i know he's coming
she said with a quiver in her voice that sounded almost like a threat
and gregory too, gregory keeps insisting that the door was open
he sat not on the bed but on mother's little stool with only his back resting against the bed
she may just have forgotten or something may have prevented her
in fact, just at that time, i pulled off something so wild that the whole town resounded with it
but perhaps i am such a flunkey, mrs prutkov, that i cannot understand how a man can decide to marry another woman when his wife is still alive
now i swear on my honor that these three hundred-ruble bills were mine, but at the time, although i was quite convinced that they were mine, i unfortunately could still conceive of the outside possibility that i was mistaken, which, for an honest man, is enough to put his claim in question, and i am an honest man
usually it was a bit pale, because of her anemia
and there were so many who threw that in my face in moscow
but let it be known once and for all that, of all the people in the world, i am the most despicable, the lowest creature
it was a deserted lane: no one lived there
yes, it was a charming picture
why can’t you imagine that something like that could happen?
it all depends on who uses it
from the very first look he understood that his rightful’ and undisputed rival might not be so undisputed after all, and perhaps not even rightful either, and that no one expected him to toast them in champagne or to hear his best wishes for new life and happiness
when i got to anna's that day i found lisa there
i won’t go into all the questions that were asked her or all the answers she gave, but will content myself with conveying the gist of her testimony
i had a good dream, he said in a strange voice
it may look too solemn otherwise
i will be back, he said, smiling at me, and you, the best thing you could do is to have yourself a good sleep
the article was devoted to a problem much discussed at the time—the ecclesiastical courts
oh, i had a feeling you’d help me!
i knew it all along!
only please do not shout like that and do not be angry, i said, scooping up the money
she left the room
i left the room in a strange state of exaltation
so why must i be the only creature in the world condemned to the curses of all decent people, even to be kicked by them, for when i assume human form i must face all the consequences of it too?
but i would rather not divulge the contents of this correspondence or repeat what we said to each other during our last meetings before her departure: that is a completely new story and, indeed, is still located entirely in the future
indeed, it was the only thing that made her happy; the rest of the time she whimpered continuously and complained that everyone had forgotten her, that no one showed her any respect, that she was being neglected, etc, etc
she was trying to save his brother dmitry, who had wronged her, and she was doing it out of sheer generosity
you don’t expect him to spend the night here alone with you, do you?
here are the wedding guests, the bride and the bridegroom are sitting over there, and there’s the merry crowd and
for the third time
no, i didn’t care one way or the other
he inquired and started searching with his eyes for the bailiff
but how can i know what the most important thing really is?
the doctor said
do you think something could happen to me here?
something about the way the priest looked or the way the service was conducted had displeased him, and when he returned home he told us with a quiet smile: i do love god very much, my friends, but i simply have no talent for these things
that tall fellow with the long hair; he had a stall here in the summer
mitya insisted in the irritated tone of a child about to have a temper tantrum
she must have conceived the idea a long time ago, and i am sure she worked it out with consummate artistry down to the last detail, he went on, drawling his words lazily
you must understand, mitya—i was only seventeen then and he was so tender to me and he would sing me those songs
why, does that surprise you?
didn’t i express myself respectfully enough?
oh, god knew of them too, but i’m sure he wouldn’t tell you
the prosecutor then related the family meeting at the monastery, mentioned dmitry’s conversation with alyosha, and told of the ugly scene in the victim’s house, when the accused broke in and beat up his father
the remaining two-and-a-half thousand you’ll receive tomorrow in town, and i give you my word of honor that i’ll get it to you whatever happens!
she would not say a word for hours; she would just sit by the window staring at the roof of the house across the street and then suddenly jump to her feet and shout something like if only i could get some washing to do' or 'i would dig ditches if only they offered it to me,  and she would stamp her foot in rage
what can you do about it?
she said she still had milk, unfastened her dress, and held the baby to her breast
i suppose i will be tried for that and get perhaps six months, perhaps a year; i don’t really know what the sentence for something like that is
but he was certainly nothing like what i would imagined and there was something extremely respectable about him, which, in the end, made me feel three times as guilty toward him as i would felt before
in the morning, however, i felt more refreshed and energetic than ever
to my surprise, he did just that and stood over her, still looking into her face for perhaps a whole minute
but it has not been officially proclaimed, and our criminals today often compromise with their consciences in a number of ways
and you find it funny?
no, i did not really; i always loved mother, i loved her at that moment too, but what happened was the usual thing: one always insults first the person one loves most
it was the first time he would dared to speak quite openly to me about anna
and why is this so?
this is the end of the wayward man i used to be
she spoke in a quiet but very clear voice and her words could be understood in every corner of the courtroom
i wiped the paperweight clean and put it back
could not that have been the reason for her hysteria?
yes, what was it my sister said to me about that baby?
it had many closets, snug little corners, unexpected little stairways and passages
why did you suddenly get mad at me, you fool?
that was exactly the reason, though!
seems to me, though, that it’s a little late for that
the blizzard was still raging
this encouraged alyosha, who was himself on the verge of tears
i was rather surprised, but followed him back and sat down
if i hadn’t made up my mind so definitely about tomorrow, he suddenly thought with delight, i wouldn’t have stopped and spent a whole hour looking after that peasant; i would have just gone on and not cared a damn if he froze to death
all the boys went
so he found her in poland, brought her fresh from there, and it was only after that that he handed her over to me
you’ll see—i’ll make life so impossible for him that he, too, will leave me for some other woman, as dmitry did, but then
you do talk a lot of rubbish, do not you?
they made pilgrimages to three monasteries and listened to prophecies
finally the interrogation of the witnesses came to an end and they began to work on the final draft of the testimony
his sincere hopelessness touched me
one of the poles answered him from behind the door
the striking thing about the prosecutor was his pallor; indeed, his face was almost green and he seemed to have grown even thinner, perhaps in a single night—for i had seen him only two days before and then he had still looked quite his former self
there was another very strong reason for me to leave moscow
his eyes were riveted on me
out of its case, the album was probably as worthless a thing as there can be: it was the size of small notepaper, a thin booklet with rubbed gilt edges, the type of album that in olden days girls used to get upon leaving finishing school
but she told me that andronikov himself was rather unclear about it
i knew i ought to have assumed a more reserved, a sterner attitude in the presence of those people
his fur coat was really magnificent and he wore a pince-nez
katerina pleaded maliciously with the court, and it was plain that she had studied and knew every word, every implication, of that fateful letter
alyosha, please come and see me again
many people in town and throughout the district started borrowing money from him, on good security, of course
i didn’t know what you were thinking at the time, smerdyakov said in a peeved tone, and that’s why i stopped you by the gate—to try and find out what your thoughts were
but now, of course, he has not got one kopek to his name
i have mentioned that during that earlier meeting with lambert, the time he would brought me home to thaw out, i would blurted out like a moron that the document was sewn into the lining of my pocket
besides, kraft can vouch for you too
isn’t this both cruel and unspeakably revolting, gentlemen of the jury?
i remember him running after me all the way to the door as i was leaving
i have always had the presentiment that they would drive you to that
well, once i’ve started something, i might as well finish it, he decided
and you must give me your solemn promise that, if i let you in, you wo not go bursting into the drawing room screaming!
yes, indeed, we can do nothing, and that’s the worst of it, kolya said
he’s her first love and she hasn’t forgotten that love for five years, and he’s really the only man she’s ever loved
are you trying to tell me something?
he was fussing about, shouting something
i will destroy you, he said in a strange wooden voice
i immediately counted off eight rubles to pay him for one month in advance
i want you to know, novice, that absurdity is very much needed on this earth of ours
i couldn’t not believe dmitry
but that does not place me beneath you—indeed, i feel i am your better!
whom did i give it to to count?
he gave his father’s house a wide berth, taking first a sidestreet, then dmitrievsky avenue, crossed the bridge, and entered the small lane at the back of the house
i must know the truth!
but, believe me, smother this man in mercy and love, and he will curse his wayward past, for there is so much that is promising in him!
but since there's nothing, absolutely nothing, then, of course, one should be allowed to talk, right?
this was the earthly paradise where gods descended from the heavens to mingle with men
it’s you who’s saying that, not he!
that's better, thank you
he felt sure that one day he would be an important man
i bet she will kick herself for it some day, but it will be too late then
you’re being insulting now
now let’s get down to brass tacks, gentlemen, and, above all, stop digging into my soul—don’t lacerate it with irrelevancies
ah, there you go again with that nonsense!
and so that explains your dream
my mother reddened violently
what are you saying?
anyway, shut up, pretty boy—better put a candy in your mouth
she did not see him fall, but she heard him cry out
the sting of indignation was deep in my heart and, within a second, i had made a tremendous decision
the turn the conversation had taken was quite unexpected
i am sure he's there
no, please don’t laugh
he looked in a very strange way at the man to whose guidance he had been entrusted by his dying elder, who had such great influence on his mind and heart
and why on earth should i be so pleased to see you, alyosha?
mitya’s face was grim when he emerged from behind the curtain; he was shaking with indignation and tried not to look at anyone
but the bed was not disturbed in any way, a fact that was carefully recorded
i have decided to reveal it to the reader so that the rest of my story will make more sense to him
he never asked and i never volunteered
i liked that and yet it made me sad, but i did not try to analyze that ambivalent feeling
think only of repentance, all the time, and drive away all fear
but it can hardly have been the only reason
what does smerdyakov say?
oh, i am so grateful to you anyway, gentlemen
it's an unbearable sensation
the three facts that interested him especially were: that the document existed, that it was in my possession, and that it was worth a great deal of money
mr karamazov finished his tea in a great hurry and locked himself in earlier than usual
and he asked you not to say a word of this to me?
well, perhaps only a thousandth then
it might have affected him terribly in his state of health
well, she has a sort of crush on andrei; actually she even cherishes the hope
so it’s true then, as they say, that it’s always rewarding to talk to a clever man, smerdyakov said with deliberation, looking meaningfully at ivan
they seem to know something
there were many ways, of course, in which kolya could have amused them more, such as standing them up side by side and making them do soldiers’ drill, or hiding from them and making them look for him all over the house
then she was asked to explain in greater detail the circumstances under which that letter had been written and received
all i know is that i, too, am a karamazov—i, a monk, a monk
do not you believe me?
he also told me that, although the old man felt a little better, the doctor still absolutely refused to hold out any hope
so you see, old man, i have a dog too, he said, turning to lyusha, and then all of a sudden he asked him: do you remember juchka?
he’s probably afraid that you’ll stand in my way, like my conscience
i’ll tell you—you wanted to ask me, what do you believe in, or don’t you believe in anything at all?
mr perkhotin informed us that when you came to see him you were holding a bundle of money in your hands
i informed my family in petersburg in writing through the proper channels that i wanted to be left alone once and for all, requesting that they stop sending me my allowance, that indeed they forget me for good (that is, if they ever remembered me), and finally that there was nothing in the world that would make me enter the university
in france i am a frenchman; with a german i am a german; and faced with an ancient greek, i would feel like a hellene
he seemed to be trying to cope with some insurmountable difficulty: he would suddenly dash up in front of the coffin and hold out his hand to support it, getting in the way of those were carrying it, and then he would come at it from the side and look for a spot there
once the deacon’s wife comes to see me and she says to me, alexander is the sweetest man on earth, but natalia,  she says, she’s an emanation from hell
but when her lips were almost touching katerina’s hand, grushenka stopped as if something had suddenly occurred to her
thank you very much, maximov whispered happily, trotting back to the blue room
but if you don’t mind, i’ll take a roll with me
the other boys chimed in
and that's how, the next morning around ten as i again started wandering from room to room, i stumbled by chance into your study
lisa, who had turned very pale, looked at me and motioned toward him with her head
i hope you’ll write me from there and that we’ll always be like brothers
i had some favorite ones among them
what i most appreciate in people is wit; it seems to be on its way to extinction
he also prescribed medicinal foot baths for her
she said in a voice trembling with emotion and, without resuming her seat, turned toward nelyudov: you must believe what he has just said
did he just say—don’t tell him’?
to propose to her now, i felt, would be rather despicable
i am sure that something of that sort is going on in your head and that's why i feel i must warn you
he pulled the folded note from his waistcoat pocket and tossed it on the table
in any case, if you find it makes dull reading, do not read it
thank you very much
so, without any reason or motive other than your imagining that the wretched vasin is your rival, you turned over to the authorities a document that had been entrusted to lisa for safekeeping
do you remember, there’s a character, a landowner, called maximov?
rakitin had a letter from mrs khokhlakov for him
you said something yourself that i found beautiful, i went on enthusiastically
i respond at once to frankness with frankness and become fond of someone who is open with me
it is not true!
that fellow who, last summer, went to town to collect the wages for the whole office and later claimed that he had got drunk and lost the money—remember him, sir?
in their relations, however, it became apparent that smerdyakov was beginning, god knew why, to behave as if there were some implicit understanding between them, and he spoke as though once upon a time they had agreed on something, something that only the two of them knew about and understood and that was quite beyond the grasp of the other mortals crawling in the dust around them
he seemed both absentminded and, at the same time, very tense, as if he were trying hard to work something out, looking for an answer he couldn’t find
no, i never told anybody
i know what duty means, gregory, but i don’t see why it’s our duty to stay here; that don’t make sense to me, martha objected firmly
if that is so, it is a mystery that we cannot understand; and if it is a mystery, we have the right to preach to man that what matters is not freedom of choice or love, but a mystery that he must worship blindly, even at the expense of his conscience
that leaves us with my client and smerdyakov
mr karamazov shrieked in a transport of delight
i’ve completed my business here and i’m leaving
wait, let’s first go in there, to the left, to the landlord’s place
i warn you—restrain yourself, for if you start playing the fool, i have absolutely no intention of allowing it to reflect on me
and i am not even talking about respect for his human dignity; it would have been simply more polite not to mention certain things
all the freedom he would had before he met her was destroyed and he was chained to a woman who had no particular interest in him
perhaps it’s suffering and torment that he’s after
both mother and daughter treated him with the respect due a superior person
ah, lise, i know you’re just saying that, but i think it would be very good if you really did have a little sleep, mrs khokhlakov said
fine, let’s have some vodka too
he was very anxious to avoid being seen by the landladies or foma, if the man happened to be around, for they were in league with dmitry and might either prevent alyosha from entering their garden or warn dmitry that someone was there, waiting for him
but now i want to talk to you about something else
you know, i went to see prince sergei earlier today, i mumbled, just to say something, and, by the way, lisa, have you been to see daria today?
i won’t, of course, bother to repeat to you all the fashionable axioms accepted by our russian boys—all of them derived from hypotheses formulated by europeans—because what to a european is a mere hypothesis is at once accepted as an axiom by a russian boy; and, alas, not only by the boy, but also often by his professor, because a russian professor nowadays is very often just another russian boy
until then he had listened in silence
you already know what a low, despicable person i am, but i want you to know that, whatever i’ve done so far, it is nothing compared with the disgrace i am carrying inside my breast this very moment, here, right here, a disgrace that i could stop, for i want you to note, i am completely in control of the situation and could stop it if i so chose
he deliberately refused to envisage any other possibility
mr versilov, she interrupted me with a bitter smile, my dear father, in answer to my direct question, gave me his word of honor that he had never had any intention whatsoever of marrying katerina akhmakov, and, of course, i believed him implicitly when i took that step
i understand that very well, alyosha blurted out quite unexpectedly
no, it’s not rakitin
yes, sofia, and all the fairy tales i would tell you because there was nothing you liked better than listening to fairy tales: you would sit on my knees for two hours and listen and listen
for until then, although i would met her when she would come to see mrs stolbeyev, i only knew her enough to say hello and exchange a few occasional words with her
i’m afraid i don’t have it with me
ah, katerina is such an angel, a real angel!
and i think you were right in what you said about mutual trust, without which, sometimes, it is impossible to get anywhere in cases as important as this one, unless the suspect is really eager and able to clear himself
i wanted to give nikolai all my sixty rubles of savings, but he refused
listen, arkady, he said, i would like you to order yourself some better clothes
he stood up, apparently intending to walk about the room for a while
and when young people play at soldiers or at robbers in their free time, it’s also a manifestation of the burgeoning need for artistic expression, and those games are often better and more natural than a theatrical performance
then mother, also in complete silence, went up to makar and bowed down deeply before him
but while others keep their evil doings hidden, he preferred to ruin himself rather than remain unworthy in his own eyes
after a minute, mitya raised his head and looked unseeing in their direction
so his weekly fare consisted of four pounds of bread and the communion wafer sent to him regularly by the father superior after the late mass on sundays
i have thought of these things, i repeated
above all, avoid lying, especially lying to yourself
and it is on this perfectly natural sequence of events that some people have managed to base their suspicions and to find indications that smerdyakov shammed his seizure!
although possibly you have not even heard
but why should that concern us, ivan said with a laugh, as long as we have time to settle all the matters we’ve met to discuss?
it is full of original ideas, but i think it cuts both ways
then he climbs down again and, for five minutes, fusses over the man he has felled, trying to see whether he has killed him or not
it was gregory who finally showed alyosha where the crazy woman was buried
all her life she had honored, in fear and trembling, her legitimate husband, the pilgrim makar dolgoruky, who had so generously forgiven her once and for ever
i am indeed very fond of them, but with you it's different: i feel at home with you, as with a son, or rather a brother
alyosha at first thought he had fallen from sheer exhaustion, but it was not so
she’s just a little girl
may god forgive him, snegirev said
maximov at once admitted, with tears in his eyes, that, being so poor, he had accepted ten rubles from mr karamazov, but, he said, he was prepared to give it back
hardly aware of where i was, bumping into people, i ran all the way to tatyana prutkov's apartment without it ever occurring to me that i would have got there much faster if i would taken a cab
the presiding judge asked sternly
somehow, i do not believe she will
fetyukovich pursued this line of questioning, although the presiding judge was stirring disapprovingly in his chair
shouldn’t i send for herzenstube?
alyosha heard a tender, almost too caressing voice
in fact, he had completely forgotten about her
but in no time i was transferred to the prince's private study upstairs and often sat there without any accounts or ledgers in front of me to keep up appearances
the dog has a pink ribbon under his mattress
two months ago, i stood here behind the curtain while you were telling mrs prutkov, you know, about that letter
how is it yours by right?
kolya couldn’t help bragging
therefore, whatever was left from your papa would then be divided in half between you and mr alexei and your shares would grow from forty to sixty thousand apiece
but i would like to question this too: was it really he who killed his father?
you mean world history?
i recognized my visitor the very second she came in, although i had not seen mother since the time she would taken me to the village church and the dove had flown across under the cupola
i see you are laughing, gentlemen of the jury
but i believe she was mad too
so pray for me today, please
i want you to like him, mr karamazov said, now visibly drunk
let them all fend for themselves
meanwhile she had made perkhotin sit down and herself sat facing him
he sounded rather apologetic, almost ashamed
and do you see those oats dropping out of the sack and that goose over there with its neck stretched out right under the wheel, pecking the grain—do you see it?
now i would like to find out whether this man is trustworthy
the thing was the result of a brainstorm of the old prince, an avalanche of ideas that he was preparing to present to the shareholders' committee
well, that’s the whole story
since you are stronger than an old woman, what's there to stop you?
but the worst of it was that what made him suffer most during that month was his pride, but we shall return to that later
he never made the slightest allusion to you know what, tu comprends
why, andrei, of course
but there’s nothing like that in our monastery—no monastery wives although there are two hundred monks
he promised to come here straight from the courtroom
a whole minute passed
so i stood there like a lost soul while the sun shone, the little leaves shimmered gaily in the light, and the birds praised the lord
i simply beseech you to go and see lise, find out everything from her, as only you can do, and then come and tell me, her mother, what’s going on, for you must understand that it will kill me, yes, actually kill me, if things continue like this
she stopped by the front door
but then dmitry himself had told him the day before that he welcomed ivan’s interest in katerina, that it was very helpful to him in many respects
why, you’ve seen her
let there be no pride on my part or distrust on his
the next day i drank quite a bit in my misery and, i confess, there are many things i don’t remember
it was tantalizingly painful because he could not quite put his finger on it
ivan removed his coat and threw it on the bench
to make further developments clearer, i would better say a few words about that now
i was stunned and outraged
do you remember the sarcasm in which the prosecution indulged, about the filial respect’ and discretion’ that are supposed to have suddenly come over the accused?
why did he drive me into such a frenzy?
but why are you trying to justify yourself, arkady?
i have grown very fond of her, very fond
in the doorway leading to the room on the right was a table which barred access to that room: the items listed for sale lay on that table
tatyana prutkov was playing a strange role when i saw her in petersburg
but then later i learned the real reason
he doesn’t despise anyone
he is expected to solve them somehow or other and to climb dry out of the water
later, when i remembered my dealings with kraft, i thought with wonderment of his ability to give so much selfless attention to other people's business at a time so critical for him and to explain so clearly and calmly things that did not concern him
the girl died after an illness that lasted a fortnight
what’s the good of trying to talk to people like you!
well, sure, ivan fell in love with her and he still loves her, and now i realize it was a blunder on my part, a blunder, that is, in the worldly, conventional sense, but perhaps that blunder will save us all yet!
mrs prutkov shrieked, shaking all over in a paroxysm of wild fury
as for stopping mr dmitry from getting in when he hears him come, gregory, i must tell you, has been sick since yesterday and martha is planning to give him her treatment tomorrow
with what wild impatience i planned a whole new life for us—how, gradually and methodically, by patient effort, i would dispel the constant fear she had of me, how i would make her become aware of her own real worth and point out to her the many aspects in which she was my superior!
here i am, an untalented bastard, who is, nevertheless, your superior because you accept the fact yourselves!
besides, i know in advance everything you’re going to say to me, as i told you before
the visitors left their carriages outside the monastery wall, near an inn, and entered the gates on foot
yes, we ought to make clear that it was not our fault, ivan said, and besides, my father won’t be there
therefore, she thought, all she had to do was to forestall that circumstance and beat katerina to it by subjecting me to that sudden, overwhelming confrontation
well, then, it was by this beard of mine that your dear brother dmitry decided to pull me out of the inn
but i wo not accept that money from you unless we embrace and kiss first, as we did after we quarreled before
then he made a spitting sound and went toward his carriage, repeating, well, i’ll be—i’ll be—i’ll be
i am not that good at coining derisive nicknames
he was hard as flint and so stingy that, despite his passion for grushenka, without whom he could not live (and this was especially so in the last two years), he still would not give her any substantial capital; even when she threatened to leave him unless he gave her a large sum, he still never yielded
he has a plan, though
i do not care if depraved old debauchees run after these creatures with their tongues hanging out, but there is such a thing as the purity of youth and that must be protected!
even if you should die,  he told me, at least you’ll know the disease that killed you!
in general, when i am in the company of such people, so as not to appear overawed, i tend to become unduly abrupt, which, of course, is not the right way to behave
he had recovered and was staying in ems with his daughter by his first marriage
later, the most reasonable of our monks could not remember the events of that day without horror and amazement, wondering how the public scandal could have reached such incredible proportions
i was not thinking about myself, i would never use it
as of this moment, his refusal has already been registered in the form of an official document, in which versilov emphasizes that he merely acknowledges the legitimacy of the sokolskys' claim and that his gesture should not in any way be interpreted as a present to them
it all seemed so reasonable when i was on my way here, and now it makes no sense
it’s the act of an animal who is unable to control his animal impulses
he’s planted himself on the pleasures of the flesh as if they were a solid rock
katerina was an object of particular interest
thus my gambling ended in disaster, but the night was not over yet and here's what i remember of it
it’s in that petersburg paper called rumors
the poor people have been burnt out
the pestle fell a couple of steps from gregory on the gravel path, where it was certain to attract attention
perhaps he’s hidden somewhere, watching
of course, this was not the coming in which he had promised to appear in all his heavenly glory at the end of time and which would be as sudden as a bolt of lightning cutting the sky from east to west
and if stern fate has deprived you of your nose now, then, for one thing, no one will be able to tell you in the future that you’ve had your nose pulled!
moreover, the young man exercised an obvious influence on his father, who sometimes almost seemed as if he would heed his advice
first, if there was no other way, he would try to act in concert with me, offering me half the profits, having, of course, assured himself beforehand that i was fully under his control, both mentally and physically
as soon as grusha and i get there, we’ll move somewhere far out of the way, where there is nothing but wild bears, and we’ll settle on the land, and till the soil
the grateful lady said, pointing to kolya
on his right, also sitting beside a bed, was another girl—a pitiful creature of about twenty
i did not do it with any evil intent, just out of complete thoughtlessness
did you tell them something about me?
tell me, did you really think i didn’t love you when i told you that my yesterday’s letter was a joke?
ivan and miusov would come out of curiosity, perhaps of the crudest sort, and his father might very easily be planning some piece of buffoonery which would turn the whole thing into a farce
she did not know that this time it was quite different!
the very thought even made him cry
the impression she had left on him was that of a beautiful, haughty, and domineering young woman
all the signs of a wicked, pettily supercilious nature
i swear, i’m really scared
because by that time god himself had stripped me of my christianity, just for having thought it, before i even said one word to them
although i was not so terribly distressed by his death, it was nevertheless a violent shock to me
youth is pure just because it is youth
we shall tell them that every sin they commit with our permission can be expiated, that we allow them to sin because we love them, and that we shall take upon ourselves the punishment for their acts
in the living room, for instance, there was quite a nice china lamp, and on the wall hung an excellent large engraving of the sistine madonna; on the opposite wall was a huge and probably expensive photograph of the bronze gates of the cathedral of florence
is it completely hopeless?
i actually thought the two of them would come to blows
the visitor exclaimed, jumping up from his seat and flicking drops of tea from his clothes
when he reached the crossroads, the figure leaped toward him, shouting in a fierce, threatening voice:
he died in the third week after easter
ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again
he only met and got to know the old man when he came to our town to demand an accounting of the estate left him by his mother
lisa, like me, also knew nothing about the agreement
not in the least, although i might as well admit that at the beginning i was rather taken aback and was on the point of answering you in the same vein
her eyes were slightly inflamed and her face was pale and sallow
i shall love you, you know that, katya, dmitry said, breathing heavily between words
gaiety was a favorite word of his and he often used it
and nowadays some of these heathens say there’s no need to fast all that much; that’s insolent, heathen talk, that’s what it is!
fyodor karamazov did not object to this; in fact, he found it rather amusing
over his head was the vast vault of the sky, studded with shining, silent stars
ivan remained silent for a moment and suddenly his face grew very sad
and you should have heard the way he went on, taking the poem to pieces!
you came here from moscow with the intention of putting us into our proper place, and so far that's all we know about your plans
'i am just looking at this little stone, your honor
then followed a whole series of letters, one a day, all just as pompous and florid as before and differing from each other only in the rapidly decreasing figure of the loan requested, until it became a mere one hundred rubles, then twenty-five, then ten, and then a letter came in which each polish gentleman asked her for a loan of one ruble; it was accompanied by a receipt signed jointly by both
yes, it is the most terrible thing there is, to shed the blood of one’s father, the blood of the man who gave you life, who loved you, who would have given his life for you when you were a small child, who suffered through all your misery, who was unhappy through your unhappiness, and who rejoiced only in your joy and success!
oh, i’m so afraid of that!
you’re sure you won’t be angry if i tell you?
on the head, he put a cowl bearing an orthodox cross
her father, who had also been a serf and was under some obligation to makar, whom he greatly respected, had asked for him as he lay dying and, in the presence of the priest and the assembled servants, had pointed meaningfully to his daughter and said to makar: bring her up and take her as your wife
do you really consider me that low then!
in that case, you would better stop expecting, i muttered with an inexpressibly painful feeling
yes, they were coming from the garden, she was sure now
as always she simply appeared, as characters appear on the stage
in fact, she went to see vasin every day
now, let me say this: i’m not against christ, for he was an extremely humane character and if he were alive today, i’m certain he would join the revolutionary movement and might even play a leading role in it
but with me, ever since luga
it's true you were quite rude just now, but
forgive me, sir, he cried, becoming agitated, as i was speeding here, i swore
what a bore you are!
and sometimes i used to take you to the forest, find a raspberry bush, sit you down next to it while i myself would get busy cutting whistles out of wood for you
why should i have come all this way otherwise?
but balaam’s ass suddenly spoke up
a slight redness suffused his face and he stood up
it is true that when men understand that idea, the kingdom of god will no longer be a dream but a reality
katerina said reproachfully, bursting into tears
it is almost six months now since all that took place
do you have something special to say?
then i picked up my little bundle and tiptoed down the creaking stairs, terrified at the thought that agafia should hear me from the kitchen
he looked extremely worried
he had completely forgotten about that door and it had never occurred to him that gregory could have seen it
let us first glance at the hapless, licentious, and depraved old man, that pater familias who ended his life so lamentably
where did you hear about it?
i want to tell you with complete frankness how much i have appreciated your kindness and your delicate feelings that have prompted you to invite me to come and see you
forgive me, father superior—i may be a buffoon and act like one, but i have a courtly idea of honor and must be allowed to speak my mind
well, the peasant who had driven the geese into town was busy talking to someone and was paying no attention
you start then, mitya said, pulling his wad of bills out of his pocket
i already knew her face from the amazing portrait that hung in the prince's study, a portrait i had been studying all that month
there's a passage in the koran where allah bids the prophet look upon those troublesome creatures as upon mice, do them good and pass them by
i can see what a skillful investigator you are, mr nelyudov, mitya said with a relaxed laugh; still, i think i’ll help you and make things even easier for you
mr karamazov asked, noticing the sneer and realizing at once that it was directed at gregory
what made you admit that to me?
perhaps i have no love for you at all
but who died of consumption  is she her stepdaughter?
i denied it and called stepanov a liar to his face
in such cases, the main job of the investigators is not to give the suspect a chance to prepare himself, to try and catch him napping, to make him blurt out his most intimate thoughts, which will be revealing in their naivety, improbability, and inconsistency
oh, i readily concede that the accumulation of facts and the collection of coincidences is quite impressive, but i suggest you examine each fact separately, without being influenced by their combined implications
after this introduction, fetyukovich suddenly exclaimed:
the dark young man said almost nothing to anyone, but this did not prevent more and more people from gathering around him
that’s just the kind of unproud heart i have
trishatov came running in and the two of us tried to disarm him
although she would accepted his money, the gun was not part of their bargain
storms, because sensuality is a storm, even more than a storm
for the girl the lad flogs today he’ll marry tomorrow
well, never mind, kolya muttered in a whisper, apparently trying to cheer him up, but with no idea why he had uttered those words
of course, i have absolutely no right to reproach him for not visiting me more often because i know how busy he is now, vous comprenez, cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa, but then i suddenly found out that he had been received in my house after all, not by me but by lise—six days ago: he came, stayed with her for five minutes, then left
but i wish i knew what an honorable man does under these circumstances
that night in mokroye, he was unhappy and worried about the old servant gregory; he was praying that the old man would regain his senses and live, that the blow he had struck him would not prove fatal, and that he—my client—would not be held responsible for that death
or perhaps five, if you wish
on another occasion we spoke about mother
when will you build your own edifice and organize your life justly by reason alone and without christ?
i would tried to borrow money from him once before, of course, a couple of weeks earlier, and he would been quite willing to oblige me
and he told mitya not to tell you about his coming, in fact, not to tell anybody
that’s how i struck him down!
dana too had come several times but, in her case, i cannot imagine what she could have been after
still, money was not the reason i was spending my time with sergei, although i needed money desperately
of course, i would been well prepared by the readings at andronikov's house, but it was, above all, the way you recited it, yes, your acting, sir!
if she wants me, i will—right away
lise seemed dumbfounded and remained quiet for a whole minute
miusov, however, was convinced that it was all put on to impress the visitors
i must find out quickly, very quickly, because
i will find lessons for you here,  he said
today, when you looked at your papa and at your big brother mitya, the idea of a crime occurred to you, didn’t it?
at last it got quite dark
so you walked five weary miles, carrying the child, he said
as a result, the landlord now will do anything to please him, he literally slaves for the old man to get him to listen to his stories
i am telling you now that you do not deserve any mercy at all and this very day appropriate measures will be taken to render you harmless; you will be taken out of town and placed in a suitable institution where they will bring you back to your senses
could i have possibly suspected you just because you went to mrs stolbeyev's apartment to see that daria woman?
anyway, i hugged my eccentric old friend hard and i felt happy
and she actually put the icon around his neck and even started to push it inside his shirt
obviously i had not expected to find them in a cheerful mood, but the oppressive atmosphere, which could be felt at once, and the despair i read in their eyes warned me that probably there was something besides sadness about makar
and that way you would settle your account with bjoring
snegirev again pointed in despair at the bare wooden walls in the passage
long before, he had said that he wanted the boy buried by the stone, but now everybody intervened—alyosha, kolya, the old landlady, nina, and all the boys
soon enough, however, he took hold of himself
i suddenly hated you at that moment and spouted all kinds of nonsense
he looks at me through the window, he believes me and he doesn’t believe me; looks like he’s scared to open, even to me
if that’s the way it is, he interrupted smerdyakov, why would you want me to leave town and go to chermashnya?
two inquisitive faces peered out from behind it
less than a hundred years after a man's death, he may still be remembered by his children or perhaps his grandchildren who have seen his face, but after that time, even if his name is still remembered, it's only indirectly, from other people's words, and it's just an idea about him, because all those who have seen him alive will by then be dead too
besides, a man is seldom willing to acknowledge another’s suffering, as if suffering placed one in a superior position
that same day i was to see efim zverev, with whom i would gone to high school and who was now studying at a technical college in petersburg
i will know in one second, whatever it may be!
it would be a public scandal, and public scandal was something perkhotin dreaded more than anything
i was haunted by my mother's gentle eyes, which had been shyly watching me during the past month
i wanted to say more but could not go on because i was so moved it took my breath away; everything looked so lovely and enchanting and i was filled with a joy such as i had never before experienced
why, you can check for yourself first thing tomorrow morning, as soon as young phoebus the sun arises
but now the unexpected karamazov parricide case brought him new hopes for his career: with a case like this, my name could become famous all over russia, he thought
if you come, make it seem as though you came on your own, just to find out how i feel
i am phaon, you are sappho,
but the prosecutor would not admit anything; he waited in silence
are you by the door?
and so i started thinking of you, i can’t even tell you exactly when, i don’t remember
he was trying hard to make me understand something
i took off and was floating through the air again
and so your behavior is pretty low and disgusting
and here, you see
he was a young man of twenty or so, who was preparing to enter the university, but miusov, with whom, for some reason, he was living for the moment, was trying to persuade him to accompany him abroad, to attend the university in either zurich or jena and obtain his degree there
for the moment, i will only say of this landowner (as they referred to him here, although he spent hardly any time on his land) that he belonged to a peculiar though widespread human type, the sort of man who is not only wretched and depraved but also muddle-headed—muddle-headed in a way that allows him to pull off all sorts of shady little financial deals and not much else
i also remember how puzzled i felt and how i suddenly said:
but kolya was already standing by ilyusha’s bed
she nodded a mute yes
my dear boys, possibly you won’t even understand what i’m saying now, for i often speak very unclearly, but i think you’ll remember it, nevertheless, and some day you may agree with my words
yes, i thought of it during that terrible month: i was about to go and see katya, tell her about my betrayal and beg her for some money to take care of the expenses that betrayal would incur (yes, i said beg, do you hear me?
but i beg you never to mention me or what i’ve just told you to mr dmitry, because he’d kill me for much less, i’m sure
father paisii remained stubbornly silent
’ this is the amazing explanation he offers us!
i am sorry, my friends and brothers, that i cannot express this more clearly
i leaped to my feet and hurriedly, breathlessly, told her about the night i would spent on his sofa, about our conspiracy before i fell asleep, although i would already confessed to her on the previous day that i would been plotting with him
if the accused rushed out of the house without killing his father, who did kill him?
there are many—oh, so many!—people without faith who just confuse the ignorant
that offended lisa and, if only for this reason, she continued seeing vasin
besides, he was so wound up that i had to be careful not to hurt him now: his agitation was so violent that, at certain points in his narrative, he suddenly stopped and remained silent for several minutes, pacing the room with a spiteful expression on his face
just try somehow not to gamble
i started building that pyramid under the blanket of my little boy's bed before i fell asleep at night, during the moments when i was free to dream up things and cry
but he was asked so many questions in the direct examination that i cannot remember them all
alyosha, my dear boy, you must go now, he said suddenly, in great haste
she gave it to me because that’s how much she loves those gold mines!
they are rich now
i will skip the formal questions and answers on the various points—they have slipped my memory
not that that restriction is to my advantage
it was absolutely indispensable for me to see him
this rich, greedy, and implacable widower, who still bullied his grown-up sons, had at first treated grushenka with a heavy hand and kept her on short rations, so the gossip had it
he would said he might be interested in renting and had inspected all the rooms
could it be, then, that i was an incurable gambler?
they still had to bring that steam engine
one such monk, father job, a celebrated ascetic, famous for his feats of fasting and his long unbroken silences, whose memory was greatly cherished, had died at the beginning of the nineteenth century at the age of a hundred and five
that means there's only my mother and my sister left and now i am almost on my own
no, i mean a clean sheet of paper, to write on
stebelkov says that he would consider my personal debt to him settled if i transferred to him my share of the inheritance, but he says that zhibelsky must also be compensated
such thoughtlessness, such a flagrant lack of faith, was felt to be pitiful, not to say ridiculous
i have already mentioned at the beginning of my story that, while gregory had hated fyodor karamazov’s first wife, dmitry’s mother, adelaida, he had sided with sofia, the crazy one, his master’s second wife, against the master himself or against anybody who said anything deprecating or slighting about her
what i regret most, vasin, he said slowly, apparently resuming a conversation they must have started before coming in, is that i did not manage to arrange it all yesterday evening
it’s so hot and crowded as it is
there still remain the questions why?
driving here a few hours ago, he had been a completely disgraced man—he had committed a plain, outright theft and
but the person most impressed by it was the visiting monk from st sylvester of obdorsk, a small monastery in the far north
his chin was quivering
his voice was frantic, his hands were raised toward the sun, his face was pressed against the earth
by the time ivan reached his father’s house, he was really in the worst possible mood
obviously i will come tomorrow
that was yesterday
all right, now i understand everything!
grushenka asked, taken aback
as i read it, i almost shivered with emotion
everyone loved agafia, though, and they needed her because she was a marvelous dressmaker
they let him in, although as a rule they didn’t open for anyone at that hour of the night
how shall i put it—well, all in all, i’m unhappy about god
you have not dozens but hundreds of witnesses; i’d say two hundred people heard me say that, perhaps even a thousand!
wouldo you realize, mother, he did not leave his address
snegirev screamed; he must be buried by our big stone
of course, people are bound to resent it if you attack them without any provocation, mrs prutkov, i felt i had to put in, and, as a matter of fact, you chose to pounce on me just when i came in with a friendly 'good evening,  which is something i have never done before
and that makes you laugh!
i walked over to the window and put my forehead against the ice-cold pane
but i demand that you answer this now: what did i do to instill such a horrible suspicion into your vile mind?
i swear, all i wanted was the idea!
our time, he said slowly, is an age of the golden mean and in-sensitivity, of a cult of ignorance and idleness, of an inability to do anything, and of a longing for the ready-made
what did he mean when he said it’s always rewarding to talk to a clever man?
it’s likely that they’ve gone to bed by now, sir
but i will come with you just to show you how little you scare me
and what about you, going to visit gentlemen after dark to try and peddle your charms for money?
and she comes up with the most unexpected arguments
she got into her carriage and the footman started to stoop down and pick up her handbag
i did everything very deliberately and unhurriedly, for i realized how careful i had to be now
nelyudov went over everything, mitya willingly helping him
and that's how that first awful day finished, one of the three fateful days with which this story ends
we just mentioned him here and now they are talking about him next door too, he said, and that's one of those constantly recurring exceptions i mentioned
mr karamazov, sir, dear, don’t kill my mistress, please!
to start with, i could have him put under lock and key for what he did yesterday
when father zosima saw alyosha, who had stopped with an embarrassed look in the doorway, he smiled joyfully and stretched out his hand to him
all right, gentlemen, eloquence is a great thing, but i ask you now—should people really be encouraged to bash their fathers’ heads in with blunt implements?
then you’ll have to take your shirt off too
at times his voice would break off
i want to know: what did he come here for?
at moments he felt he was suffocating
and now may i ask you this, if you don’t mind, fetyukovich said, unexpectedly changing his line of questioning, what were the ingredients in the preparation, or shall we call it the brew, with which, as appears from the preliminary investigation, your wife rubbed your back that evening, in an attempt to relieve your pain?
by the way, everything you have here, we have too
it had all happened, the landlord specified, in
so stop annoying me
can’t you understand that, if i haven’t killed you yet, it’s only because i want you alive in court tomorrow
i interrupted him, and he looked at me as though trying to think of something
but toward this man, her first love, dmitry felt no jealous hatred whatsoever, nor even any hostility for that matter, as he streaked toward them in his troika
you know, i’d love to stay and have a long chat with you, my friend, but i’m afraid i haven’t got a minute to spare
alyosha took a three-kopek french roll and put it in the pocket of his cassock
i knew you would heard all those rumors
i jumped down, looked at him, and started wiping away the blood with a handkerchief
then, when i saw mitya, i told him laughingly that the pole had picked up his guitar and tried to sing me those old songs of his, hoping that i’d lose my head and go back to him
the little girl held in her hand a basket of the kind the peasants make
it’s all absolutely out of the question
i would be only too happy if it were so!
and now they’re traveling together
that’s your family’s problem: you are all sensualists, money-grubbers, and god’s fools
the servants left the room at once
because at the very moment when god damns me, at that exact, precise moment, it’s just the same as if i’d become a heathen and my baptism is taken away from me and no longer counts
she said, laughing and crying at the same time
after examining various opinions that had already been expressed on the subject, ivan presented his own views
if i had not been so furious yesterday, i think i would have laughed my head off: he turned pale, rushed up to me, bowed stiffly, and mumbled something in french
he screamed, beside himself
believe me, i particularly appreciate having you as my guest, zosima added, bowing to miusov and returning to his own seat on the sofa
and if i have to, i’ll give them money too, for some women take money and take it with passion too; i admit that pleases them and makes them thankful
i ca not tell you more about this because it's still a secret
but at least we’ll die in our own country
i am paying you back so i can ask you for satisfaction!
it was quite possible that he was a former army officer
finally ivan stirred, ready to get up
so, without intending it, we had some sort of an explanation
but everything was not taken care of yet: now on november  we were having the third day of cold winter weather and all i had was an old raccoon-lined coat that used to belong to versilov and that would not fetch more than twenty-five rubles
if there were a shadow of a possibility that someone else—some sixth person—might have been there, i am sure that they would have suspected him instead, for even the accused realizes how utterly absurd it is to suspect smerdyakov of the murder
suddenly, it all struck me as very funny and i began to laugh
he was very handsome, too, and slender, above average height, with dark-brown hair, a regular although rather long face, and shiny dark-gray wide-set eyes, which gave him a thoughtful and serene look
she always thinks i don’t love her enough
but your ideal is rather vulgar, people might object scornfully; all you are after is money and material goods
well, i suppose today's younger generation is rather impatient while its understanding of life is still very vague, versilov said
where did you get all that?
it's all the work of that double of his!
it goes to show the subject is already familiar to you, that you’ve given it some thought—sensuality, that is
no, the shot doesn’t burn
as for vasin, i felt immensely relieved when he finally sat down at his table with his back turned to me and got down to work
practically the whole town besieged her and pleaded with her, but that only made her more disgusted: if it could bring my poor little babies back to life, i would have to accept him at once, but since it wo not, what would be the point?
just think of the tales people tell about america, for instance—it's really quite unbelievable —even from distinguished statesmen!
however, the old woman’s principal heir, the marshal of nobility of the province, efim petrovich polenov, turned out to be an extremely honorable man
some may say that alyosha was not too bright, rather uneducated, had not even finished school, and so on
my god, he’ll end up murdering somebody!
the presiding judge again warned him that he should just answer the questions and not indulge in frenzied and irrelevant exclamations, and then he ordered the proceedings resumed
listen to me: i thought today i’d have that bandit dmitry locked up, but i still haven’t decided what to do
i’ve already been there, seen him
kolya noticed that again he was becoming breathless with excitement
i wondered what all the tragedy could be about
one of the windows was open and fresh, cold air flowed into the cell
and i tell you, he has quite a few ideas in his head and he could have been— ah, hell!
the elder asked, looking at ivan
that’s a good sign
as i read it, i turned paler and paler, but when i would finished, the blood rushed to my face and my lips quivered with fury
what i mean, the elder went on, is that all this business of sentencing people to hard labor, with or without flogging, does not reform criminals and, more to the point, does not deter them from committing crimes
one way or the other, a lull followed
but what could he do about it?
oui, she asked you to come here
but even then, to enjoy looking at someone is still not the same thing as loving him
for i do not believe you grieved much about the others; in fact, you hardly ever gave them a thought, did you?
n-no, not quite
i had not known of the existence of this portrait and i was struck by the extraordinary likeness, i mean spiritual likeness, that made it more like a painting than a mechanically produced print
later, however, your suffering will be alleviated and your life will turn into a sweet contemplation of the complete fulfillment of your firm and proud design
one of my sons—alexei—is seeking salvation here and, being his father, it is my duty to concern myself about his future
i have only one soul, i used to say to myself, and if i lose it, i will never find another
and that’s just what happened
so that’s what you want, my gentle boy!
i, for instance, demand annihilation for myself
i shall put it into words for the first time since its inception
i don’t feel like laughing now
i decided to kill some time there before going back to mrs prutkov's, expecting that by that time she would have returned home
he’ll just put those arms around me and carry me off
so i’ll wait for you three or four or five or six hours or even seven hours, but i want you to know that today, even if it’s at midnight, you must go to katerina’s, with or without the money, and tell her that i send her my best regards
bless them, father, he said
yes, just friends, but i still think we should agree on one point: even if some day we should disapprove of each other, if we should become spiteful and nasty and horrid, even if we should forget everything else, let us always remember this day and this hour; let us vow never to forget this day when we walked side by side, laughing and feeling so gay and happy
and when he had finished his complete account of the scene in which the hapless captain trampled the hundred-ruble bills underfoot, lise threw up her hands in despair and cried with unrestrained feeling:
for the hundredth time i repeat, there are many questions that could be asked, but i ask you only one—about the children—because i believe it conveys fully and clearly what i am trying to tell you
i was simply trying to express my opinion
but smurov, the southpaw, needed no instructions
look, i will loan you two thousand rubles without interest and wo not even ask you for an iou
but what would i want him dead for?
and they ask and demand so boldly that the lord at once gives them the rank of angel
but, of the things the bulgarian told me, the following scene particularly caught my attention
whose finger did he bite?
do you really think she deserves it?
go to chermashnya for me and i’ll soon follow you there myself and bring you some presents
an intelligent man quipped recently that all our progressive movement has achieved in the past twenty years is to prove our crass ignorance
but if that’s where you want to go, it suits me fine
smurov suddenly asked heatedly
and although my present step was only a trial move, i felt that, to take it, i should first graduate from high school, break off relations with everyone, retire into my shell, and thus be completely independent
it was this confrontation between karamazov and his eldest son that led to the catastrophe which is the subject (or at least the external plot) of my first, preliminary novel
but even if the ladies of the entire world had joined their protest, even if they had been headed by the prosecutor’s own wife, even then they would have failed to stop him at that moment
when grushenka had asked maximov about his further plans, he had told her that he really had none for the moment and that, in fact, he had nowhere to go since mr kalganov, who has been putting me up until now, told me he couldn’t have me anymore and gave me five rubles
so do not disturb their joy, do not torment them, do not deprive them of their well-being, do not work against god’s intent
smerdyakov seemed extremely tired and said nothing for a whole minute
it was done in the most natural way
ah, come on, mitya, stop it, you crazy man, grushenka said reproachfully
it turned out the girls couldn’t love him either because:
the moment maxim had spoken, the newborn babe became sick
she hasn’t regained consciousness
it was time, though, to conclude the preliminary investigation with the interrogation of the witnesses
anna was only slightly pale
and thus making at least this small group of people happy
i’d love to see one!
what's he doing here?
it stands to reason that he hated the thought of where the money was to go, a sum that would have been enough to change his own future
i know it’s on the other side of the wood, mr karamazov told him
and to think that it was all the fault of the monster he was so desperately anxious to save!
i decided as i rushed home
that is precisely the crucial question, he said with irritation and got to his feet
i want you to admit
it's true i would like to marry her, but i do not need any capital, i despise capital
why, you have turned pale, my friend!
the new prank was, however, of a very different nature; it was quite innocent, indeed, foolish, and besides, as it turned out later, it was not even of kolya’s direct doing; he was only involved in it
during that first visit, he even managed to offend ivan by telling him sharply that people who believe that everything is permitted were not really qualified to suspect and question him
you do not really believe that scum, do you?
this is simply a solution of zinc, alexei
it was the first time we would been like that in our lives
but that is not what happened
give me your hand, grushenka—look at this tender, plump, charming hand, alexei!
that's what i ask myself
i have thought about it a great deal and have come to this conclusion: why should it be so inconceivable for such a true and simple communion to exist some day among all russian people?
a man, you know, may fall in love with physical beauty, with a woman’s body, maybe even with just a bit of that body
possibly i was the only one in that room to understand what vasin actually meant by ideas-turned-into-feelings
mummy never spanks us, nastya remarked
you know those gypsies—they’re all thievish and crooked, a lot of horse thieves
later, people assumed that he had gone to live there as maria kondratiev’s fiancé and that she had not charged him rent
i myself had told him various things on the subject on different occasions, except obviously for certain secret details
i do not know myself
her notion that it was somehow reasonable to marry the man vanished like a patch of fog scattered by the wind
you have to pound it all together, add some water so it forms a kind of a paste, and then pass it through a very fine strainer, like sheepskin—and there you have your powder!
it was at this point that the elder came back into the room
ivan leaped to his feet, swung his fist back, and hit smerdyakov
well, i do not remember exactly how he put it, but she trusted him once more, responding for the last time, so to speak, to his chivalrous promise by her heroic decision
and there are some nuts
and mitya says it’s impossible to live without happiness
that’s all, no more!
the pamphlet about richard was translated into russian by some high-society russian do-gooders of the lutheran persuasion, and it was distributed free as a newspaper supplement, for the enlightenment of the russian masses
nevertheless, he prescribed some mineral water that they have in the pharmacy here for my wife, and i’m sure it would do her good
it may last several hours, sometimes a whole day, or even longer
but you’re really wonderful!
where is juchka?ilyusha asked in a breaking voice
later, however, the cheerful din of their voices and the stories they told began to distract her, and eventually she came to enjoy their presence so much that she would really have missed them had they suddenly stopped coming
was not i emphatic from the start in telling him that there was nothing between her and me and could not be?
i understand that moscow high schools are very good
oh, i knew only too well that i always began to love your mother as soon as we parted and turned cold toward her the moment we were together again
the baron, on the other hand, kept raising his voice and was obviously a man who could lose his temper without much provocation
what’s the matter with you?
i do not say that deprecatingly; it is not a matter of egoism with them, nor a matter of having a thick hide and a lack of refinement: there is perhaps more goodness in such hearts than in certain heroes; it is a reflex of self-preservation, acquired from the long experience of being downtrodden, that ends by dominating their behavior
mademoiselle, he may have told anna without beating about the bush, it is up to you whether to remain an old maid or to become a princess and a millionaire
smerdyakov removed the rag from his eyes
what does it really matter to me?
this is an awful poem,  he said, sounds as if it was written by a divinity student or someone like that
oh, i realize how stupid it was on my part to consider your money as my own
the prosecutor was very pleased with himself; by taunting this nervous fellow with irrelevancies, he had succeeded in exasperating him, throwing him off balance, and now the man had said what he had wanted him to say
she’s very sentimental too, and that’s how i’ll get her,  he said
among memories of my childhood, i must also include my memories of the story of jesus, about which i was very curious when i was still quite small
he took the song almost as a personal insult, announced that he was bored, sat down on the sofa, and dozed off
and that's just what mr andrei versilov did at ems
she said it was anna who would sent her to tell me that she was at home, waiting for me, that i must come right away because otherwise it might be too late
her name was mrs tatyana prutkov and she was a landowner in her own right, owning, in the same district of tula province, a property with thirty-five serfs on it
'still, mother, i want you to wait before you start spending that money
my promise to give versilov one-third of the inheritance is eating me
would you like some tea, perhaps?
but you yourself went around town telling everyone who would listen to you that you had gone through all of three thousand rubles that time, didn’t you?
he always had, ever since the time i prostrated myself at his feet to thank him for that money, at the very beginning
i do not mean that literally of course, but when he was given pocket money (for which he never asked), he either kept it for weeks on end without knowing what to do with it, or spent it at once on anything
because of his belief in these special talents of his, he felt that his remote superiors had failed to appreciate him fully, that his career had been hampered by secret enemies
but how did you manage to escape?
he's your father, is not he?
and when i saw mother that evening, would i be able to say to her, as i had during these past days: i am on my own, free and independent
he said he had had a nosebleed, but they did not believe him
he first glanced absently at alyosha, but soon a frightened look appeared on his face
he stood there for a while, all alone in the darkness, and then clutched his head between his hands
he’s such a sweet boy!
before hanging himself, he left a note, which was rather strangely worded: i am putting an end to my life of my own free will and no one should be blamed for it
indeed, after that, everything was not only easy but even pleasant and exhilarating
they were all on the rhine, at some spa or other, all taking mineral water cures
it’s human blood, and, god knows, there was no reason for it to be shed!
so what did he ask you to tell me?
i hope you’ll forgive me for saying this
when they meet they look at one another with deep, thoughtful understanding and in their eyes there is always love and sadness
so she said she ought to be flogged in public?
and he sat there deep in quiet, sweet thoughts
my reasoning went like this: i have a hundred rubles and there are so many auction sales, junk shops, flea markets, and people requiring things in petersburg that if someone buys something it's inconceivable that he wo not be able to sell it for a little more
he’s learning french words by heart
when do i receive the money, sir?
the company that had issued the shares was raking in huge sums of money, but even so the offices could not handle the mad demand; people of all ages and walks of life thronged the surrounding streets; bourgeois, noblemen, their children, countesses, marquises, and prostitutes—all melted into a furious, crazy crowd, as if they would all been bitten by rabid dogs
but only for the reason i’ve told you, you must believe me!
that's good, he said, articulating his words with deliberation
but at the time i was at home
i think you ought to go back to bed and get some more rest
you are afraid of them, are not you?
it's a long story
but what a pig that prince is!
i gather that by the time he was ten or so he had become aware that he and his brother were not being brought up in their own home but were, in fact, living on other people’s charity, and that there was something about their father that made the very mention of his name a cause for embarrassment
and then there was also that frenchwoman inquiring after you— mademoiselle alphonsine de verdun, she said her name was
jupiter possesses thunderbolts and is serene, for how often does he unleash his thunder?
who, miss katerina verkhovtsev?
we could assume anything rather than that
and why must you always play the fool?
oh, but here is that corner
lidia akhmakov died a couple of weeks after her confinement but i do not know how
before we continue, i would like you to tell us, if you are willing to, whether it is correct that you disliked your late father and that you were constantly quarreling with him
you didn’t really believe he’d start performing miraculous tricks the moment he died, did you?
suddenly she was overwhelmed by a longing for revenge
she seemed to have suddenly understood
i almost shouted at him
i know you have the reputation of being a witty man, but being witty is not the same as being intelligent
his eyes flashed, he laughed awkwardly, and his face turned deep red
i never saw him again after that day he spent in my apartment
just in case it should come up
knowing very little about medicine, i will only risk the assumption that perhaps he had succeeded in delaying the sickness by a desperate effort of will, although of course he could not avoid it altogether
i exclaimed in amazement
something had irritated him unexpectedly, something that he described laughingly as an amusing incongruity
has not she arrived yet?
actually, mitya himself was none too sure what instructions he was supposed to give and why, actually, he had hurried out like that
and he would burst out laughing when there was absolutely no reason for it
he sat down on the bench and made alyosha sit next to him
from across the street i heard a scream, a drunken voice, and a streak of foul oaths
it may still be useful to you tomorrow, and you’ll be coming here again to ask me to lend you another ten rubles
and if you don’t go, he’ll be in a fever by tonight
the singers stood ready to burst into a dance song at the first signal
the singing and the deacon’s reading can be heard clearly from the church there, so it’s as if they were reading right over his grave
they say that man could not do without it on earth, for otherwise he would not be able to learn the difference between good and evil
you forgot to mention him, although it is on him that the edifice must be founded, it is to him that they will sing, you were right, o lord, for your ways have now been revealed to us!
she pleads, she refuses to give up
and even when he did, on occasion, talk to them, he was always brief, abrupt, and peculiar, and often rude
the room in question was in his private quarters and was just like any other room in the apartment of an official of his standing and i think it would be irrelevant for me to describe it
so you did want to kill him?
and that object was found soon after they had heard gregory’s testimony
but it was anna herself who told me that rumor this morning, well before noon, which was certainly before you surprised her with it
and then the merchant turned us down flat: t do not know you,  he said, 'and have no wish to know you
that was the only solution, but it was a solution
don’t look at me as if i’d said something idiotic
that won’t help her!
just think—that old man, hard as flint, and there he fell in the twinkling of an eye!
he was clean-shaven and wore his soberly brushed hair rather short
please do not pay uny attention to his ravings, katerina; i told you he was described to us as deranged by the people he used to live with in moscow
i also remember very tall trees by the house, lime trees, i think, and blinding sunshine pouring in the windows, the little flower garden in front of the house, the narrow path
lately, it had happened that this boy, who before had always known where to stop, had begun to do things that really worried his mother
until the day before, alyosha had had no doubt whatever that katerina was deeply and passionately in love with dmitry
even two of the important old dignitaries shed a few tears
in fact, he was a rather arrogant fellow who seemed to despise everybody
a strange moment for a man to show such compassion, wasn’t it?
as soon as lliey had sinned, tliey repented
for whatever you sow, you shall reap, or however the saying goes
after taking a few steps, he suddenly faced the setting sun, raised both arms, and, just as if someone had cut him down, hurled himself to the ground, yelling crazily:
i started dashing over to see the carpenter's wife three times a day and, toward the end of the week, i managed to slip her an extra three rubles without her husband noticing it
although, come to think of it, what kind of prophesying is it to bang one’s head on the floor?
indeed, the following day he reappeared on the promenade as if nothing had happened
the elder had told her sternly that she could not have prayers said for the soul of a living person, that it would be witchcraft, but he then had forgiven her because she didn’t know any better and added, as though reading out of the book of the future, as mrs khokhlakov put it in her letter, that her son vasya was indeed alive and that he would soon either come back to her or send her a letter, and that she should go home and wait
then i said gott der sohn,  and he babbled in his tiny voice, gott der sohn,  and laughed again
what precisely is an elder, then?
when before daybreak the elder’s body had been made ready for burial, laid out in the coffin, and taken into what used to be his reception room, someone had wondered aloud whether the windows should not be opened
they reasoned with him for a long time and finally succeeded in calming him down
they all rose from their seats and rushed to him
now imagine this: that bandit had offered her fifteen rubles as an advance
there were lots of serfs on that tula estate and among them was a gardener by the name of makar dolgoruky
mitya asked, staring at him
they both shrieked, for how could they not shriek under the circumstances?
he was rather pale at that moment, but his eyes were glowing and intense
(the baron looked me over with scorn)
but just two days ago, he wore a quite unaccountable fixed stare when we were talking
it has nothing to do with kindness, he said
i told him that i was going to my old man samsonov’s house for the whole evening and would stay there very late counting money
he talked a lot like that and the bits i have mentioned are just odd samples to give a general idea of the sort of thing he said
the jurors retired and the court was adjourned
she sat down in the armchair where she had sat earlier
only i am not sure whether that's what i was really thinking
i cried out, turning deep red and holding onto his hand, which i had seized and forgotten to let go
are you waiting for me, by any chance?
but please, holy father, you mustn’t think for one moment that i’m implying anything—i was just wondering
mrs snegirev shuddered but at once recovered and giggled happily
she wasn’t bad-looking either, to the russian taste: tall, strong, with a full figure and beautiful eyes, although her face was somewhat coarse
he sort of demanded it of everybody
and don’t bring it up again
how could i help it when you hadn’t put the bandages back in the proper place?
it was the women who eyed the champagne the most eagerly; the men really preferred brandy, rum, and particularly hot punch
well, don’t believe it, the gentleman said with an affable smile
in fact, i want to thank you with tears in my eyes and tell you how deeply i respect you for the way you behaved on that occasion
when i stepped out into the street and took in a chestful of cool fresh air, i shuddered all over with animal delight, i would even describe it as carnivorous
if she could do it, the thought somehow flashed through his head, why can’t i?
he will be preaching about god just as he did before and
and although miusov’s story may have been exaggerated, there was certainly an element of truth in it
he felt a sharp stab in his heart
but i feel you have to be a piece of slime to say that
the landlady, a very old woman, lived there with two nieces, themselves already elderly spinsters
i suppose i did it for no special reason, just for the hell of it
i believe i have the whole picture now, ivan went on, thanks to those instructions shouted to you, together with some other indications
you have no right to insult me, mrs prutkov, and you would better stop!
and you like people to honor and respect you, because you’re very proud
mitya was surprised in his turn and told the priest that that was how samsonov had referred to the man
these have chosen by their own free will to suffer
answer that question for me, alyosha, and whatever you say, so it will be
could this be your 'idea' by any chance?
even in you, philosopher that you are, it must be possible to discover it, too, if one catches you unawares
and you are right, my dear boy, gambling is a stupid and piggish occupation
but his features were drawn and his complexion unhealthily yellow
wait, see that traveling bag?
but then he passes one house after another, his cart moves on and on
carries you off to heaven alive?
but an end to this fearful isolation is bound to come and all men will understand how unnatural it was for them to have isolated themselves from one another
i have been wondering what made you decide to leave that money for me yesterday
all right, good-by then, alyosha!
there were cards on the table and they seemed to have been dealt out for a game of fools
perhaps there's really no point going into all this, but the few days that followed, during which nothing special actually happened but which have remained in my memory as a pleasant and serene period, should be mentioned because such periods are rare in my past
i enjoyed the flight, i loved it
what have i done to deserve to be waited on?
well, as i said, that was precisely the weak point of my idea: it allowed all sorts of detours
the ladies were less pleased with the prosecutor’s summation, but even they were duly impressed by his eloquence, especially since they were not in the least worried about the outcome and had complete confidence in defense counsel fetyukovich, who was to speak at last and would, they felt, crush all opposition
the visitor i just had was mr versilov
you know that, if ivan hasn’t recovered by that time, she will take care of everything herself
everyone in the courtroom cried out with joy, they were so pleased with the verdict
we must start right away with the interrogation of the witnesses
now, if i hadn’t stolen her money, you still could have told her: but whatever else he is, he is not a thief, so here is your three thousand rubles—he sends it back to you
ah, it's quite a long way, i see
besides the fact that this money would be honestly acquired from a highly respected and saintly sister, i would be able to get medical treatment for my wife and nina—you know, my hunchback daughter
oh, there was much that i forgave her when i gradually grasped the situation
you see, that samsonov to whose house i went
mother, you’re spoiling him, ruining him, lise’s thin little voice came from behind the door
let me tell you this: it was i who caught you, not you me, just now!
but i have been waiting and worrying the whole week
he also confirmed reluctantly, and only after insistent questioning, that, after the poles had been turned out, mitya’s standing with grushenka had improved dramatically and she herself had let him understand that she loved him
and, indeed, mrs khokhlakov’s carriage had driven up to the gate
it’s an inner conviction, the feeling i have about the man
she’s the sister of that general’s widow from moscow and she used to be even more high-and-mighty than her sister until her husband got caught misappropriating government monies and lost everything he had
i’ll sign anything
at one point the clerk, who had followed them behind the curtain too, and who was fussing around his superiors, suddenly called nelyudov’s attention to mitya’s cap, which was also being felt and fingered
you must forgive the bad pun, since you’ll have to forgive me many other things much worse than that today
tell me that first, for if you don’t, you have no right to accuse him!
nevertheless i described with tremendous heat whatever i knew on the subject
well, capable of killing that old fool fool—do you?
that bow, however, had made a staggering impression upon alyosha, who was absolutely convinced that it had some mysterious meaning
no one saw her
i say that it was neither trifon nor sabaneyev, but chizhov, said a third woman, who until then had been listening intently in silence
i noticed, though, at various dances—we had a lot of dancing parties—that her eyes would flash a look of helpless anger at me
in fact, just the opposite, i feel children should show respect for their parents
he obviously felt that a man visiting the monastery with such laudable intentions would be received and treated with much greater consideration than an ordinary visitor who had come out of mere curiosity
thomas believed, not because he saw that christ had risen, but because he had the will to believe beforehand
no, no, mitya, who still couldn’t understand, insisted
as to how to deal with me, for that too he had two alternative plans of action
he said that by the stone
to sin with a pretty, playful serf girl (my mother was not playful) was not only natural but well-nigh inevitable for a depraved young dog (and every landowner was depraved, whether liberal or reactionary), particularly in versilov's case with the idle life he led and the romantic figure he cut as a young widower and all that
he knows what it is
i just said that to impress him
where were you going, alyosha?
and he may have had a point, because i looked out of place there, like some sort of savage, sometimes even attracting people's attention
when we got to a wood lambert, reckoning that after having been caged for some time a bird would not be able to fly very far, let the canary out and started shooting at it
they say that paper cannot blush, but that isn’t true
what’s in this crate?
mitya seemed to remember something
kolya rushed out into the street
no, i didn’t really mean that
no, you don’t really want it
i do not want your love, because i do not love you myself
mademoiselle alphonsine, the pretty boy said, moving toward her and showing her the tie
this time they seized me and held onto me
you are surely not speaking of yourself, are you?
you have given me a new lease on life
his hair was awfully black; his complexion was fair; his cheeks were red as though they had been painted on a mask; his nose was long with a hump in it, the kind many frenchmen have; his teeth were very white and his eyes black
besides the heavy, fleshy bags under his eternally insolent, suspicious, mocking little eyes, besides the multitude of tiny wrinkles on his small flabby face, his large, meaty adam’s apple hung under his sharp chin shaped like a purse, and this somehow gave him a repulsively sensual air
there’s a fellow called foma who lives in this house with those sluts
it’s all my fault, mitya started, having again misunderstood grushenka’s rebuke
i know you are very hurt, lisa said, blushing deeply
may the almighty forgive that correspondent for those fading charms,  as i forgive him, for let me tell you, i know who that correspondent is!
i’m not even sure whether i had any affection for you then
you understand, he is asking this of us, of us who have come to ask him that very question!
and there was not the slightest resemblance between the two of us—in fact, we were just about opposites
i can still hold up my head before you
and it was in that state that alyosha found him
so you must have heard it from him, right?
she’s not likely to marry a fellow who doesn’t have a thing to his name, like mr dmitry
we understand this comedy
not even a tiny little bit?
as a result, i stopped talking to him seriously myself, and soon i almost stopped talking to him altogether
i do not remember what brought about that memorable conversation, during which he occasionally sounded rather irritated, something very unusual for him
they explained to him that this particular epileptic seizure was an exceptionally violent one; that, for several days afterward, it had kept recurring; that, indeed, the patient’s life had been in considerable danger at first; and that only now, after intense medical care, could it be said that the danger had passed and the patient would live, although, dr herzenstube added, it was possible that he would suffer from a mental disorder that might last for a very long time, perhaps all his life
of course i’m not going to tell on you, but, for the time being at least, i will have nothing to do with you
besides, he must have heard by now about versilov's gesture
do not hate those who reject you, those who dishonor you, those who abuse you and slander you
he stopped short when he saw me and his face twitched
we do want him, we do!
he repeated suddenly, and this time loud enough for everybody in the room to hear
nor would i have to run after women—they would come running after me, anxious to give me everything a woman can give
mitya started to plead with the priest to accompany him and help him get hold of the hound—you’ll save my life if you will, father—and, after some hesitation, the priest finally agreed to go with mitya to sukhoi, probably because he was curious about the whole business
don’t you think i am living in heaven now?
when she spoke, i understood from her very first word
when katerina sees lambert, she bursts out laughing
i shouted, glaring at him
suddenly, glancing at his face, i recognized in his expression the same fixed, desperately intent, and perfectly sober eyes riveted on me as that morning when i would almost frozen to death
he did all that in great secrecy
you’ve heard, haven’t you, that the elder zosima died?
in that case he would have been the victim of temporary insanity; he would have simply been subject to a natural law, irresistibly and unconsciously, like everything in nature
thus, lisa, who in our presence was so proud of her hero, treated him quite differently when the two of them were alone: i am convinced of this from certain indications
i think if she heard us laughing together a couple of times, her gentle and simple heart would fill with joy
we would walk around looking for a respectable woman, follow her waiting for an opportunity when no one was close to her, and then, without saying a word, come up, one on each side of her, and, pretending not to notice her presence, we would start having the most obscene conversation across her
no innocent should be made to suffer for another man’s sins, especially innocents such as these!
all of a sudden?
i will tell you, i will tell you a frightful secret, mrs prutkov, but not just now, because there's no time now
the old servant brought him the samovar, and ivan poured himself tea, but he did not touch it and sent the old woman away for the night
rest assured, my boy, that i am sincerely delighted
and if there's mystery in the world, it only makes it even better; it fills the heart with awe and wonder, and it gladdens the heart: 'all is in you, oh lord, and so am i, and so keep me
then he suddenly calmed down
why, did you serve in the cavalry then, since it was the russian cavalry that you were talking about?
can’t make you out!
then the blood rushed to his cheeks
c’est à ne pas mettre un chien dehors
i suddenly knew that, try as hard as i might, i would never succeed in making a clean break from that whirlpool, notwithstanding my obstinate silence and my refusal to ask daria to elaborate on the wonderful things she would told me
but i can’t, father: you know it’s about fifty miles from here to the railroad station and the moscow train leaves at seven pm i can barely make it as is
nevertheless, i definitely disliked him now
tell me, though, are you really so concerned about mother?
yet i have declared a thousand times that i had no intention whatsoever of writing about myself and i was determined not to do so when i started out on these memoirs because i realized only too well that there was no reason why the reader should be at all interested in me
mitya let out a yell and ran into the forester’s room across the passage
will you at least tell me that finally?
and here’s julia bringing us the ice!
so go and fear no more
alyosha did not finish school
these were the very words of the old lecher, who knew he was dying and who, indeed, did die within five months
so let us part good friends and you will remain the most precious and the most meaningful memory in my whole life
and it was at thatl moment that i noticed sergei and darzan: they stood behind me
believe me, i have often been very bored in the company of society people, especially since my return from abroad and all the troubles that have beset my family
i’ve met him, but i want to hear your opinion
and i saw the other one changing a card, kalganov said
and he suddenly produced his wad of bills
he took alyosha to a far corner of our cemetery where he pointed out a cheap but decently kept grave with an iron headstone bearing the name of the deceased, the dates of her birth and death, and even an ancient four-line verse such as is often found on the tombs of lower middle-class folk
he asks me, for i understand you’re supporting him now!
he would given her a down payment of twenty rubles, and the following day, after he would stolen the letter from me, he would had a second meeting with maria, promising her another two hundred rubles for her further services
much has changed since then
and i think and think
that kind of thing, vasin said in conclusion
she found them living in dire poverty, almost indigent, without food, heat, or tobacco, and owing money to their landlady
mitya exclaimed, as if some brilliant idea had just occurred to him
and these were the questions that had tormented me back in moscow, to which i would hoped to find the answers when i joined him in petersburg
the two merchants looked respectable enough, but they seemed strangely quiet and slow-moving
however, everybody knows how a child burns up clothes and now they had to run around barefoot with just their shirts on their backs
then he went and fetched all the evidence he had to prove his crime
but, in the first place, it is possible to love children, at close quarters, even if they are dirty, even if they have ugly faces, although to me a child’s face is never really ugly
i want him to sit here, with us, she said imperiously, addressing no one in particular, although she looked at the man on the sofa
it’s because she’s so afraid of it that she’s sure he’ll recover
i know i’m vile, but still i like being what i am
he said he couldn’t diagnose it yet, that we would just have to wait and see
cost me what it may,
besides, women are never too good at evaluating correctly a man's intelligence: if they like him, they are only too eager to accept even his paradoxes for well-reasoned conclusions as long as they coincide with their own wishes
but how could i not have been offended by the way that woman had treated me?
after the death of his wife, he went to his country estate where he had that affair with my mother
but now i think i have run too far ahead
is there a hope left that i have not?
what if rakitin is really right and god is just a fiction created by men?
you frightened me with that sock of yours, he said, grinning strangely
that's no literary notion, he said, although i suppose you may be right
somehow that seemed to anger him and he flung his hat into the snow muttering, i don’t want the hat, i don’t want it
he’ll see you a little later, when he gets back
he’s sent a story about her to a newspaper
ah, yes, he would take her away at once, if not to the edge of the world, then at least as far as possible, to the edge of russia, where he would marry her and live with her, knowing no one, here or there, or anywhere
well, for your information, my boy, what she was trying to do was to eat you up!
and mrs akhmakov is going out again a great deal, one ball after another; she is having a great success and they say everybody, even the people at the imperial court, is crazy about her
the following morning he had nothing but contempt for smerdyakov and his sneers, and a few days later it struck him as rather surprising that he should have been so painfully hurt by smerdyakov’s suspicions
i was worried about that too, but
for instance, under direct examination, the testimony of the innkeeper at mokroye, trifon, created an impression extremely unfavorable to mitya
don’t you know that this is the greatest of his days?
he had that wound
and imagine, as i was leaving, who should arrive but sergei
well, why not, you are not even twenty after all, so it is quite excusable
did he do it alone or was the accused his accomplice?
but then, days pass and my client’s father does not pay him the three thousand rubles
they are proud and brave in exposing themselves to danger, but worried and full of concern for their companions, because everyone is anxious for the life and happiness of everyone else
it was about four and getting dark when i returned to mrs prutkov's
right, he let it out for a walk—that’s just what i was trying to say
ou est lambert, as-tu vu lambert?
but you know she’s not here
indeed, two or three days before, he would even inadvertently allowed himself to mumble something indicating very indirectly and in a roundabout way that he was afraid for me or, to be more accurate, afraid of the dressing down his daughter would probably give him because of me
the terrified fenya was only too glad to get off so easily, but she realized that he did not have time to argue with her then and that otherwise she might have paid dearly for her lies
tell me what happened that night
then we drove out of the city gates to do some shooting, and on our way we met a bird catcher with bird cages
do you remember the first question?
only when he came to the door to see his son off did the old man become a little agitated and even make a gesture to embrace him
he felt very weak and ill he started to doze off but then nervously got up and walked up and down the room to shake off his drowsiness
i felt it degrading to explain to this woman the new goals i would set for myself
of course i do and, what's more, i am just the same
and the battle of stones was resumed, this time very viciously
if, instead of all your abstract philosophizing, you talked to me like a human being; if, for instance, you would said something to me about my idiotic gambling, i would not have allowed myself to sink into it like that, i suddenly reproached him
and it so happened that a week after that he had his first fit of the falling sickness, an ailment that was to afflict him for the rest of his life
when the wise and dreaded spirit placed you on the pinnacle of the temple and said, if you would know whether you are the son of god then cast yourself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself; and you shall know then whether you are the son of god and shall prove how great is your faith in your father, you heard him out, then rejected his advice, withstood the temptation, and did not plunge from the pinnacle
he muttered with the grin of a maniac
he’ll come here because he’ll be raving mad or because he’ll be afraid that i’ve failed to let him know because of my illness, or he may just lose patience, become suspicious, and want to search the house, as he did yesterday when you were here yourself, to make sure that she hasn’t slipped in unnoticed somehow
he seemed to have completely forgotten that a few moments earlier he had terrified, insulted, and hurt her
and is not it to keep my eye on her that you want me to continue going to the prince's?
she said, now with unmistakable impatience, dismissing the matter with a wave of her hand
but, come to think of it, anna said again, not so very long ago your feelings toward katerina were not so nice at all
besides his tender fervor, i also liked in him certain extremely original views on various problems still controversial in our age
right, nuts, that’s what i wanted to say, the doctor said imperturbably, as though he had never forgotten the word but been interrupted
then why do you stand being pushed around and why are you afraid to hurt them?
and i don’t feel at all ashamed when i tell them to you
you won’t be afraid to stay alone and you won’t start crying, will you?
i cried, reeling under the impact
i took it out and examined it with a certain curiosity
probably he managed to throw it away somewhere under the table
why don’t i have any respect for you, alyosha?
a month later, however, i was staring at my revolver and thinking of death
he also knew that some monks were quite outraged by the custom in the hermitage of first bringing all letters received, even those from relatives, to the elder, who unsealed and read them before handing them over to the recipient
he told me that, as things stand now, he’s dishonored and he doesn’t care about anything anymore, alyosha said, speaking with great heat, with the hope pouring back into him that perhaps there really was a way out, that his brother could still be saved
i am not sure whether the presiding judge somehow separated the witnesses for the prosecution from those for the defense (i expect he did), or in what order they were supposed to be called
i wo not attempt to analyze here what prompted versilov to make such a deal with an individual like lambert except to remind the reader of that double of his
he leapt to his feet, and, with a wild responsive howl, not knowing what he was doing, rushed to meet her
where does she live?
the way he would asked her that might have warned her to give up the whole thing, but she was such a headstrong, impatient girl and she would not take such insolent questioning
at first, she listened to me with that usual composed, patient smile of hers, but little by little surprise and even fear appeared in her intent look
was it anna who told you that?
but the clouds will pass and the music will play for us again
the words escaped him involuntarily
i’ll ask her if i see her
it must be noted, incidentally, that considerable changes had taken place in alyosha since we met him last
i was just trying to make a pun,  i said, trying to cheer up the company a little
actually i was nervously waiting for matvei
on the way, maria kondratiev suddenly remembered that some time between eight and nine in the evening she had heard a terrible, piercing cry from the garden
oh, i know i have behaved cruelly and dishonorably toward her
but mother quickly covered her face with her hands and rushed out of the room
and, indeed, when kolya once asked the teacher who was the founder of troy, dardanelov replied in general terms about the migration of peoples, about the difficulty of discerning facts in such ancient times, about the creation of legends, without giving kolya a precise answer, ie, without naming the person or group of persons who had founded troy
i suspected what kind of place it was, but i did not imagine it would be so much like a kennel
it was a tiny room containing only the most indispensable furniture
we’re late and it’s against their regulations
and the owner of the geese keeps hollering, they could have killed lots of geese that way!
it may come in useful sometime in your wanderings
i can just imagine how furious i would have been had i been in sergei's shoes!
that really incensed him, and he had the affrontery to tell katerina that, after what had happened, he was no longer surprised at all the fantastic rumors that were circulating about her
the two poles suddenly stood up
but this time sergei shuddered so violently when he saw him that i noticed it from where i sat
listen, you irresponsible old woman, kolya said, getting up, i want you to swear to me on everything that is sacred to you in this world, plus something else to make it a bit stronger, that you’ll keep an eye on these children here while i’m away
you are a much better person than i am, incomparably better, and i am awfully fond of you
do you really mean it or are you just pretending?
to put it as concisely as possible, i had decided to give serious thought to lambert as soon as i was able to think straight
that is all very nice
they were larger and more comfortable than the elder’s, but their furnishings were not very lavish either: the chairs were mahogany covered with leather in the old style of the ’s and the floors were not even stained, but everything was spotlessly clean and there were beautiful flowers in the windows
as to wrublewski, he turned out to be a dentist in private practice
but i bet he did not make it—it was you who said that to him!
i felt sad but laughed as convincingly as i could
alyosha felt that his father was a bit like a certain tradesman in the town
what did he want?
i feel sorry for her, but a feeling of disgust rises up inside me
the greatest idea there is?
and, you know, i still feel depressed about it
there is one detail that engraved itself so strongly on my memory that i must mention it: mother was sitting on the sofa and close by, to her left, stood a little round table on which an icon lay, apparently put there for some special purpose
and he can see ilyusha’s dying
my dear boy, i am only too pleased to hear that you
how does your daughter feel?
however, during all that time, she never completely lost contact with makar
i promised to come back and see him the next evening, so that we could talk everything over, since there was so much we had to discuss
but i am sure, gentlemen of the jury, that you can remember for yourselves the sad scene that followed
i cannot stand it any longer!
he made a second appearance in town, this time to force on his father a final settlement of their accounts
yesterday you gave her fifty rubles for your board, but she says it could not possibly have come to more than thirty
anything could happen, but when he first arrived in lambert's company he had no idea of what it was going to be
i even heard from unimpeachable sources that several serious family quarrels had broken out on mitya’s account
and my anger was growing too
both the side pockets of his overcoat were bulging with stones
the authorities have given us official permission and indeed, they are rather encouraging the marriage
about three weeks ago he came here and started teasing me
and i’ll tell you also, mother dear—we are all guilty toward others and i am the guiltiest of all
it's too easy to make mistakes, to exaggerate, to miss things
in despair, poor strangers wept,
we have heard the prosecutor admit that, up to the very last moment, until this very day in fact, he hesitated about whether he should charge my client with cold-blooded, premeditated murder
he watched helplessly as they dragged her away, crying and stretching out her hands to him
they drove up in two carriages
i do not need one ruble more than i have
i was sold to him and i’m tied to him, since we were married by the devil, and there has never been any other man
alyosha was looking at her, trying hard to understand her
what right did you have to allow this slut into my room!
then, of course, i could not talk in mother's presence about his meeting katerina and all the rest up to the most important point, that is, the letter he would just received from her and his moral regeneration that followed
he was born of a hen
alyosha began to weep
i know the gate was locked more than an hour ago, he said, looking intently at alyosha
glory to the highest in me,
alyosha was in a great hurry
you may have really decided to put that bullet into your brain
the poles were already seated
my whole article is based on the idea that, during its first three centuries, christianity existed on earth as a church
i know i promised to stick to facts, but what about the reader?
you were warned,  he says to him
i’m addressing the question to all of you, reverend fathers!
dergachev occupied the whole cottage in the yard of a wooden house belonging to a merchant's wife; the cottage had three rooms and in all of them the blinds were drawn
it was a delusion, he said, but may that delusion be blessed!
i even kept crossing myself as i walked
and maxim built the promised church in our town and also a hospital and an almshouse
although father paisii heard alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction
and later he could go to some other town and become a justice of the peace or something of that sort, for i am convinced that people who have suffered themselves are the best qualified to judge others
lisa too thinks he's wonderful
all right, i’m going
and whose intelligence and character she had always considered superior had reappeared on the scene
now, losing patience, mitya pulled the man violently by the arms and legs, lifted his head, picked him up, sat him on the bench, and finally, after long and stubborn efforts, succeeded in getting the drunken man to produce an inarticulate bovine lowing, which was followed by slurred cursing
besides, as we all know, a bundle of bills in someone else’s hand always seems bigger than it really is!
he's missed you so much
why is it annoying?
indeed, if a lady with a romantic imagination came across my notes, she would make a sour face from disappointment
i can safely say that lambert may have had good reason to prepare an alternative plan to betray her, and it was perhaps really her fault
well, all that's none of my concern, i said impatiently, all i want to know is whether mr versilov is still at home so i can find him there
whatever we may say, maxim said to her, he was no babe when he killed himself
i would look after those sufferers
mitya asked at first, but a second later he shouted in a strangely loud voice, as though he had been turned into someone else: i under-stand!
it was an extremely bright day
she beseeches you to accept it—both you and she have been harmed by the same man; indeed, she thought of you only after she had been insulted just as badly—i mean hurt as deeply—as you were
the floor was rotting, the floorboards loose, and the woodwork musty
it was not really makar's death, not just that
but he didn’t stab me again
it is good that you should think of these things rather than others
and he does not love you
many years later i learned that versilov was abroad at the time, that she had decided to come to moscow and had used her meager savings to pay for the journey, i believe secretly from the people with whom she was staying in versilov's absence—all that just in order to see me
mother muttered something disconnectedly and thanked him and, when madame touchard came in too, mother started begging them not to abandon this poor orphan because he is just like an orphan really, so please be good to him
and so it was
oh, do not bother about it, ma'am, just add it to our accounts
that woman who’s driven so many to their ruin!
it was just a windfall for you and me that he invented that story, because that is what will pin mr dmitry down for good
but then you must tell me the truth, everything, and what you meant by that noose
stebelkov, who had been on his feet since the noise began and had been blissfully eavesdropping, unabashedly burst out of the room into the passage
so now i’m trying to put as much aside as i can, and just for my personal, private use, my dear son alexei karamazov—i want everyone to know that
seen from the outside, of course, not from my own viewpoint
and i remember answering them: well, why not?
the woman burst into tears of sheer joy
kalganov was aware of mitya’s relations with grushenka; he probably also had a good idea of what the pole meant to her, but he was not much concerned with all that
i would been to mrs prutkov's only once before
since, they said, it is just as impossible to escape sin and the devil in the church as in the outside world, there was no point in coddling sinners
he looked wildly around him
but suddenly he burst in on her
why should not women work?
i know you think it works miracles, but you watch: i’m about to spit on it and you’ll see that nothing will happen to me
he repeated for the third time in an imploring voice
but alyosha had nothing new to tell the monks for they already knew all about it: when rakitin had sent the monk to call alyosha, he had also asked him to most respectfully request his reverence father paisii to receive him, because he had a message of such great urgency to deliver that he didn’t dare to delay one minute
let me tell you this: my little brother sasha, who was still a small boy, died four days ago
and she herself closed the heavy curtains
i’ll see to it that he comes to see you, the elder said
sofia, here's some money
the prosecutor asked him at one point, adding: you needn’t answer this question if you don’t wish to
but why did you have to start as stupidly as you could, as you put it?
i will give you just one week, no more
and you, rakitin, shut up, because you’re lying
it creates, in fact, a most interesting problem: once, for instance, i heard a member of the government say that his best ideas came to him when he was asleep
and even when he came out of his thoughts and addressed his visitor, it was always suddenly, unexpectedly, and he always sounded as though he had said something other than what he had intended to say
well, when he’d read it, he laughed and started to criticize the poem
you might at least look at me now!
snegirev put in ingratiatingly
in most cases, people, even the most vicious, are much more naive and simple-minded than we assume them to be
you may not believe it, but i’ve had a feeling for a long time that you’d come up with something like this in the end
but you said so yourself
mother soon came to her senses, sank down onto the sofa, covered her face with her hands, and burst into tears
i could cause a commotion here too!
dmitry’s whole personality and even his appearance made ivan cringe
she broke away from him, pulled aside the curtain dividing the blue room, and dashed out
at the table in the doorway sat a man who, judging by his badge, must have been a court official, and he conducted the auction
and i really mean this although, as you well know, i do not belong to the gentry myself
but mrs prutkov was frowning
in any case, let me hug you!
at that moment, i heard a carriage rumble by me and then stop by the gate of a house
what he wanted to do was to come out, face the people of the town, and announce publicly that he was a murderer
every day, every hour, i went about with the fifteen hundred rubles dangling from my chest
but even then i already knew that all the problems facing me did not really matter, that the only thing i was interested in was katerina, that outside of her there was nothing
that’s how he lives
she screamed at me
also, his hair was cut much shorter
now tell me, who is most to blame for their failure to understand?
how can he, when he obviously prefers her to the woman he’s promised to marry?
go on, please—tell me
and so he was baptized then and there, and princess dashkov acted as his godmother and potemkin as his godfather
i only know that there had already been three elders, zosima being the third
but whatever the reasons, once i had that document in my possession, i felt in such a strong position that i was only too tempted to rush off to petersburg
unfortunately, though, such words and such talk are inevitable at school
that's what he was like at the time, and obviously these ways made everyone respect him, although i have heard it said that he was quite unbearable
that was the moment when rakitin caught sight of him and pointed him out to alyosha
they remained silent for a moment, alyosha looking quite alarmed
you,  he says to me, you think i killed him,  and he says that to me, of all people
he did not know that the younger lady had advertised herself in the newspaper as a teacher
mitya had opened the pistol case, untied the powder horn, carefully poured out some powder, rammed the charge into the pistol, picked up a bullet, and, before inserting it, was holding it between his thumb and finger, examining it in the light of the candle
and did you believe him when he told you that?
the table had been moved next to the sofa so that the room looked very cluttered now
somehow or other, he had made friends with your father’s lackey smerdyakov (your father was still alive at the time), who taught the little boy a stupid trick—i mean the filthy and beastly trick of kneading a piece of soft bread into a ball, sticking a pin into it, tossing it to a hungry dog, and watching what happens
oh, i know very well that the best thing i can do when there are people around is to keep my mouth shut
as to the imminent return of the officer, the man who had played such a fateful role in grushenka’s life, dmitry somehow did not even give it much thought during those days
or perhaps you simply heard him tell it to others?
i thought it was not quite as respectful as it should have been
but peter, who is not one to be easily intimidated as you know, suddenly assumed a pose of outraged dignity, gave mr rakitin such a sarcastic look, and started to apologize: oh, i had no idea you had written it!
when he had met her before, this woman had always left him with the uneasy impression that she held a threat; and the last time he had been terribly shaken by her malicious, wicked behavior toward katerina
perhaps that ray will do
perhaps it’s a secret, though?
listen, arkady, i have known all along that you had no idea of what was going on and yet you persist in offending papa and thereby offending mother as well
gentlemen, he said in a loud voice, almost shouting, please don’t mind me
i agree, my boy, that if i am right, the whole business looks rather silly, but i ca not help it if it does
yes, arkady, he really is not well, i did not just invent that for convenience
porfiry answered quickly that he had done as he had been told and had handed the widow the money from an anonymous well-wisher
this time he was completely dumbfounded
did you put it just like that?
and did you see devils there, among them?
do you think it is really right to confess publicly?
but i don’t care if i did
so alyosha said to himself: i cannot very well just give up a couple of rubles, instead of all that i have, or, instead of obeying the lord’s follow me,  just attend church
the assumption was, of course, that all this was an act of freely and sincerely accepted obedience and voluntary submission to salutary guidance
but on this occasion, makar turned the conversation in a strange and unexpected direction
they lived in a small room, but it was clean and sunny
from the beginning, all of us, especially mother, surrounded lisa with loving sympathy
but, we’ll talk about that some other time, too
alyosha was visibly shaken
i’m so sorry i can’t go and see him
they were reintroduced in russia toward the end of the eighteenth century by the great ascetic (as he was called) paisii velichkovsky and his followers, but to this day, almost a hundred years later, elders are found in only a very few monasteries and they have occasionally been subjected to persecution as an un-russian innovation
the finnish woman was either cuttingly rude or, after mrs prutkov had finally exploded, silent for weeks on end, thus punishing her mistress for stepping out of line
it is a fact though, he said, starting to laugh again, that the inquisitor is ninety years old, so he has had plenty of time to have been driven completely out of his mind by his idée fixe
will that put your minds at rest?
and all this time the devil's song continues and pierces her soul deeper and deeper like a spear—the notes get higher and higher and then, suddenly, it all breaks off in a shriek: 'accursed one, this is the end!
tell me at once, where is she now and with whom is she, in mokroye?
his knife was in his pocket and somehow the palm of his right hand was smeared with blood
at this late hour?
i made up my mind at once
yes, she's been quite a character ever since she was a little girl, our miss tatyana, makar said with a smile
and this meeting took place precisely wherever it was the boy lived as a child
the caucasus would be good for your daughter
and you must add this to that prayer: i do not pray for them out of pride, o lord, for i myself am the most loathsome creature of all’
tell me, have you met mrs khokhlakov?
i’m longing to have a drink, especially to have a drink with you
i’ve really got myself quite a reputation around here!
the clerk kept repeating idiotically; i know you, i know you!
people are living in russia now as if in a hotel: they plan to leave at any moment, they only hope that it will last as long as they are around
ah, and they will take the bed away!
you don’t usually seem all that afraid of him
so she said that she can be hard and cruel herself—ah, i love cruel, strong women of that sort, although i cannot stand it when someone is jealous of me, i just can’t stand it!
it was obvious that she no longer cared what consequences her testimony might have for herself, although she must have visualized them earlier, for during the previous month she had often asked herself whether she should not, after all, reveal the letter at the trial, and she had shuddered with rage as she imagined the scene
you see, gentlemen, i am well aware of the difference that exists between us
well, then,  the old man adds with a grin, so now you have seen free men
that was the only reason
the old prince nikolai sokolsky was sitting on the sofa near a little round table while, at another table covered with a cloth, anna was making tea, pouring the boiling water out of the landlady's glittering samovar, which i would never seen so beautifully polished before
perhaps, after his long absence, he was anxious to see his father; perhaps, before he came, he recalled his childhood many, many times, seeing it like a distant dream, dismissing the ugly ghosts of his early years and longing to rehabilitate his father’s image in his own eyes and to embrace the old man
the cook opened the door and informed me with her usual ill-mannered apathy that her mistress was out
i would anticipated his objections and explained to him that what i had in mind was not as stupid as might appear
even five minutes before the end, as they later reported with wonderment, none of them suspected anything
he had also helped himself to two cups of chocolate
then she pours some of the stuff into a glass and makes him drink it, and says a certain prayer
then we spat at each other's feet and parted, never to meet again
i am doing my verv best to write about other people and if, nevertheless, i keep popping up again and again, it's just a regrettable necessity, which, try hard as i may, i find quite impossible to avoid
and what about the money?
cleverer than you, boy
later, there was no one to oppress me and, if anything, it was i who treated other boys with contempt
yes, and i think you’re right, ivan said in a quiet but firm voice
i draw my lips close to her insolent bright red lips, which are quivering with laughter and inviting me
that’s the question, for i cannot live without her
she said, turning suddenly to the smaller of the two
relax, sir, there's really nothing for you to worry about
i clenched my fist and shook it at stebelkov
how is it possible that you know me?
today she actually demanded to be allowed to get up, to stand on her feet, and she did stand up for a whole minute without any help
but what’s the matter with you?
i am sure you were just as lovely as she is now
and you know, i also used to know an old man once
self-sufficiency is the most important: even now i have a violent dislike for contact or association with people
and so mitya sat staring wildly at the people around him without taking in what they were saying
i want it all to myself—it cannot be ilyusha’s!
and although, mind you, he never once used the rod on the child—he was afraid after what had happened—he could frighten the wits out of him all the same, even without a rod
do you follow me?
and if i became so excited and irritated, it was because i detected behind certain words the implied existence of secrets and intrigues which reminded me of the past and with which i was fed up to the teeth
the most important thing now is to convince him that he’s on an equal footing with us even though he has accepted money from us, alyosha went on hopefully
later you’ll be glad you did
i’m afraid i’ll hate the sight of him too much at that moment
his language was perhaps more colloquial than the prosecutor’s, but it was also more precise, and he avoided long and involved sentences
but i must run off and write that letter, she concluded abruptly, even starting to walk toward the door
i want you to keep quiet, alyosha, because you’ve made me feel ashamed with what you said about me
he had brought me here to clear up some misunderstandings, to justify himself, to find out something, but now everything had been cleared up and justified without any need for words
there was a silence, a silence that lasted for a whole minute
what was your purpose?
when i stepped out into the street, i somehow felt full of energy: something new and important was building up inside me
mr karamazov left the window
but all this is hindsight on my part, for at the time i did not detect at once the change that had taken place in him: i still had the sensation of floating through the air and there was still that same music playing in my heart
but i don’t know, sir, i don’t know, mr karamazov
but a couple of weeks after his first visit to smerdyakov, strange thoughts started to torment him again
mrs kondratiev, a well-to-do merchant’s widow, took lizaveta to her house early in april and tried to keep her there at least until the baby was born
before i bring a new character—versilov, that is—onto the scene in my chronicle, i must give some brief background information on him, even if it really does not mean much
alyosha, i love grusha terribly, mitya said suddenly in a quivering voice
and he swung around in his chair so violently that it cracked
so you’ll go to grushenka!
is it a novel?
how can you talk like that!
you have not the slightest idea of what i can show you!
mrs prutkov also came to see me, almost daily in fact, and, although she did not treat me with anything resembling tenderness, at least she did not berate me as she had before
ilyusha held his hand and was calling for his father
as he was reaching for it, his sleeve caught in a china lamp that fell to the floor smashing into a thousand pieces so that the whole house resounded
i will describe it without comment
i have been preaching to you for a great many years, my dear fathers and brethren, and, of course, all the time i have been doing the talking
i knew and found it amusing, so i helped those miserable thieves and crooks to perpetrate their forgery and i did it for money!
i weep even now, german, even now, you dear old man!
but madame touchard will be offended and the boys will laugh at me
i had prepared a plan of action for the day
you can bet what you like that they’ll go right to those eternal verities, such as the existence of god and the immortality of the soul
next to this desk was an equally wretched-looking armchair, with a spring sticking up in one corner that got in versilov's way when he sat down and made him swear
so if the administration of justice were in the hands of society as represented by the church, it would know whom it should absolve from excommunication and receive again as its son
but ten days later, little arina fell ill i got a doctor to examine her
but the hell with them
let me apologize once more for reporting all my drunken thoughts in such detail
if you believe that, you must be either blissfully happy or desperately unhappy
when you were about to come here last spring, you thought to yourself: there are new people there who plan to destroy everything and start once again with cannibalism
he frowned and said: fyodor karamazov, our dear papa, was a pig, but he reasoned correctly
it occurred to him now that ivan might very well be there, especially on the eve of the fateful day
i have said so before
the thing is, i was morbidly sensitive to false notes
see, i was not lying!
and katerina, whom she has also offended, must forgive her too
and i’m supposed to bear it for twenty years!
i met mr vasin last year in luga, lisa answered with complete simplicity as she sat down and looked at me gently
and here’s a letter for you, ma’am!
oh, i think, if only i were here alone!
he could not bear to hear dirty words or a certain type of talk about women
but then it was as though someone whispered into my ear: you can be sure, if you go to ask for her hand tomorrow, that with a character like hers she’ll refuse to receive you and order her flunkey to throw you out of the house, as if challenging you to go ahead and cry it from the roof-tops, to show you that she isn’t afraid of you
he could not face the bonds of marriage and withdrew from the world to seek silent and solitary retreats where he felt sheltered from worldly vanities
no, they could not
the door on the left led to another room of exactly the same size that was shared by my mother and sister
i do not stand to inherit from anyone, so i ca not tell you what i would do
he had never been so insulting with me before
as for the disgrace, what difference does it make?
he was suspected of irregularities—in brief, his enemies were preparing a nice surprise for him
let’s all drink, all of us!
when alyosha first heard of the planned gathering, he was very perturbed
the present generation of progressives is incomparably more down to earth when it comes to their own interests
her complexion was very fair and her cheeks delicately rosy
whenever the boy would take his nose out of his books for a second, he would be sure to hear maxim shouting: hey, boy, read your book!
and i do respect you precisely for having, in this era of rot and decay, got hold of some 'idea' of your own—i certainly remember that you have your 'idea,  you can be sure of that
some of these i still remember
all that my puny, euclidean, earthling’s mind can grasp is that there is such a thing as suffering, that no one can be blamed for it, that quite uncomplicatedly cause precedes effect, that everything that flows finds its proper level—but then all that is just euclidean gibberish, and, being aware of that fact, i cannot agree to live by it!
the doctor said, stamping his foot and becoming really angry
why are you grinning like that?
it is true that all the mud slinging started only much later, for, at first, everyone was immensely impressed by her revelations
i don’t even know yet all the things i’ll tell them
there’s nothing for me but a stinking alley and that she-cat!
but he came back to me; and for two weeks after that, he kept coming back every evening, still preparing himself, still unable to make himself go through with it
she was waiting for lambert anxiously and was surprised that he, who had been turning around her until recently, had suddenly vanished into thin air
such an individual acts like a really guilty man just out of fear, or because he has been intimidated
kolya snapped at the boy, who turned beet-red but did not dare to answer
when she would lined them all up by the church door, the children still had some sort of shoes on their feet and jackets that still looked like jackets, for they were not peasants after all but the children of a merchant
i often acted like a terrible heel at that time, and i was well aware of it myself
and then, to the remaining questions, one after another, the answer was always the same—guilty, guilty, guilty—and always without extenuating circumstances, without recommendation for leniency
well, in the sixth week of lent, my brother became seriously ill his health had always been very poor; he was weak in the chest, had a frail constitution, and was predisposed to consumption
and it's possible that there was a profound meaning in what he said, which, however, you simply did not understand and
leave him alone, the hell with him, i whispered to versilov
let me look at you
that question is my answer
he cried, as if he had suddenly come out of his daze
we may see greater things, see greater things yet!
remember, though, there were only a few thousand of them and even these were gods rather than men
so i look at him and see that he has one of those stupid round mugs—he must be about twenty or so
i heard that in his last month he became much more sensible, even somewhat reserved; he stopped being frightened of everything and bursting into tears and, in all that time, never once mentioned anna
now that was something nobody could really understand
i’m terribly afraid of him!
just as in the first days of creation when the creator, at the end of each day, paused to admire his work with the words, that which i have created is good!—so in this story he looks at job and again praises his creation
i came here to make you my wife, but i find here not the woman i know before, but a different woman, a woman who behaves bad and has lost all shame
wait, do not say anything yet
that is why i am sending you
versilov turned to mrs prutkov
but would you be so kind as to explain to us what really prompted you to jump back into the garden?
ah, the way she jumped to her feet and threw herself at him!
and i can still see him now, sitting in that armchair, gentle, smiling, and always looking cheerful despite his illness
i sat there with them and wondered to myself why i didn’t even know how to talk to him now
grusha, my life, my flesh and blood, my only joy!
she said in deep reproach
if you undressed him you’d find a yard-long, smooth brown tail, like a great dane’s
it was a million zloty bank
her dialogue with god is absolutely fascinating
wait, that door
and if this phrase has reached you now, perhaps there's something i ought to congratulate you on?
i love you as much as alyosha, you know
well, it's great that you are up now
this time, however, the dog’s patience was tested for only a few seconds:
smerdyakov, who had gone to fetch something or other in the cellar, slipped on the first step and fell all the way down the stairs
well, i believe it would be worth our while to discuss that envelope for a few minutes
but then karamazov tries to blame a man who was lying in bed at the time, knowing full well that he may anger him and make him immediately tell the truth, if only to protect himself—make him reveal that both of them were in on it, but that he himself was not the killer and had simply been too frightened to prevent the other from killing
while you would be sitting there, fancying we were in awe of you
don’t laugh, rakitin, don’t talk about the elder—he was better than any man on earth!
and he slapped me affectionately on the shoulder
why, then, at five pm of that same day, by your own admission, you
cried the pastors and the philanthropic ladies
if i would told you before, we would have quarreled and you would not have let me come see you in the evenings
in the first place, the prosecutor began, what is the origin of this suspicion?
perhaps nothing will come of it, and it will just peter out by itself
for half an hour i waited in the street in front of that house
the only trouble was that she was unhappy; she was too willing to sacrifice everything for an unworthy and irresponsible person
dmitry karamazov told me that, and you must believe him
he came in moaning and crying, and now he’s ill
what is it i am supposed to know?
each time i come here, you stare at me with great curiosity and i can almost hear you thinking: he still hasn’t done it!
certainly, argues the prosecution, but this man, who had been shouting in every tavern that he wanted to kill his father, two days before the murder, when he wrote that letter, behaved in an unusually quiet manner and picked only one quarrel with some shop-assistant, because, we are told, karamazov could not help picking a quarrel with someone
not so my commanding officer, an old lieutenant colonel
you don’t believe one word of what i’ve told you
and i also wanted to say this to you too: if you decide to do a good thing, do it not out of envy but for god
mitya seemed extremely puzzled all of a sudden
smerdyakov murmured now in a faltering voice, smiling abjectly, prepared to draw back at any second before ivan’s anger
he was soon demoted to the ranks for fighting a duel, only to be restored to his rank again for gallantry
i can’t see it at all
alyosha heard the shrill laughter he knew so well while he was still in the hall, and realized from the sound of it that his father was still in the blissful state preceding drunkenness, but not yet drunk
that's impossible, she graduated with a silver medal!
please do, by all means, write down that i won’t answer it
according to my idea, you can find something devilishly interesting in every woman, something you won’t find in any other
yes, he does say bad things about you, but then he says bad things about everybody
no, nothing terrible will happen
without being sufficiently educated, sergei sokolsky pounces upon various ideas and tries to cope with all sorts of situations that are beyond his capacities
he has disgraced the uniform, some said, so let him hand in his resignation
and then something happened that was to change the course of my life
but alyosha did not have a chance to pursue his thoughts
more than that—perhaps this memory will protect him from succumbing to the temptation to commit a mortal sin and he will think better of it, saying to himself: yes, there was a moment when i was good and kind and brave!
mitya gaped at him, completely dumbfounded
oh, like him, we are such a spontaneous, sincere people; we are such an amazing mixture of good and evil; we love enlightenment and schiller, but we also love to rage and storm in taverns and to tear out the beards of our drunken drinking companions
here we are sitting all alone, without anyone to hear us, so why must you insist on continuing with this comedy?
i was also thinking of my sister
in that case, he would have confessed, because he would have had to
besides, he is the murderer; i may have just said it was gregory, but it’s really dmitry and it’s much better that way!
there was only one man who was close to her—the bedridden old merchant, but then he was much more of a father, a guardian, to her than anything else
the first thing he would done that morning was to move mother and lisa (who, i learned later, had been ill since she would returned home and had to stay in bed) into my former coffin-like attic, while the rest of the place, especially the living room, had been cleaned and tidied up with special care
my dear friend, this is getting so interesting that i suggest
after all, she too possessed that typical russian breadth!
did you come all the way from the petersburg side?
glory to the highest in the world!
i am not a man of letters and have no wish to be one; i would consider it indecent and despicable to drag my soul onto the literary market and turn it inside out while describing my feelings in beautiful words
and, to be sure, he carried it all out, exactly as planned and described in this letter!
true, he never asks me for money, but it would be all the same if he did
a confession is a confession—a holy sacrament—i revere it and prostrate myself before it
what was important is that i had finally gained insight into the man, although, paradoxically, i felt almost disappointed that it all turned out to be simple
who counted the money?
'a ladies' prophet,  ha!
killing you, did you say?
they’re crazy, both of them, rakitin hissed, staring at alyosha and grushenka in amazement
and since you know now, i said, almost choking with emotion, tell me this: is it because you suspected i knew the whereabouts of that letter that you have been so nice and friendly with me and lavished on me your irresistible charm?
and what do we find in reality?
don’t you remember the fellow who killed that merchant olsufiev?
i want you to explain to me why these burnt-out mothers are standing here, why there have to be poor people, why the poor babe must suffer, why the steppe is barren, why people don’t embrace and kiss one another, why they don’t sing joyful songs, why they look blackened from that black misfortune, why there is nothing to feed the babe
in this, lambert was basing his hopes mainly on bjoring
alphonsine exclaimed, et les amis?
we’ll be ending soon, don’t worry
were not you there too?
only i insist that it not be here, but behind that curtain
i assure you it's true
kolya suddenly burst into delighted laughter
no, not him, i did not mean sergei
for you’re dealing with a suspect who is perfectly willing to give you evidence that will incriminate him!
i, too, have a very important matter to discuss with you, only i don’t know how to begin, alyosha said
but what’s the matter with you?
ah, what is he reading?
nevertheless, it made a great impression
yes, out of great joy!
have you been admitted to communion?
what would be the point of lying to ourselves when that’s just how things are in life and, i suppose, it’s the only possible way they can be
i remember now that i promised you much more, infinitely more, than three thousand, but i was thinking of the mines when i said that
and what is america?
the gun went off and the bullet hit the ceiling without harming anyone
so the devils got hold of her and tossed her into the flaming lake
i started to walk again and resumed my train of thought: there is a serious objection
rakitin turned into a back alley and walked away
to think things over more comfortably, i lay down on vasin's bed
you don’t really expect me to give you the whole three thousand right away, do you?
his brow was knit in concentration
besides, i admit i’ve had quite a bit to drink
yes, he had, but he still could not get rid of the past—it was still there, tormenting him; apparently he could not atone for the past just like that
i felt it was unfair, i even detected something sarcastic in it
well, now you’ve seen, now you’ve heard for yourself!
somehow i could not make myself look into her face
she just arrived a short while ago and now she’s sitting in there with them
sometimes i think i’m just another despicable bernard!
i’m so sorry i played that silly trick on you
i know that for sure
and where is it now?
you may be lucky now, though
if he went there by bolshaya street and then crossed the square, it would be quite a distance
there followed a long silence, which only increased the irritation her intrusion had already provoked in me
and he's a man of great understanding
this exile was a quite well-known scholar and he had once taught philosophy at the university
this is my young friend arkady vers——here he goes again—arkady dolgoruky
speak up—i want you to explain what is really in your mind
why don’t you wait a short moment, mr gregory, and hear what i have to say, because i haven’t finished yet
you know, alyosha dear, until now i had very little respect for you, i mean, i respected you only on an equal footing, but from now on i’ll respect you on a superior footing
but best of all, keep your mouth shut
then something strange happened
we had a lady like that in moscow, just as virtuous, who also would turn up her nose just like this one
besides, even now your manners are not all that perfect either, for why did you have to avoid looking at anyone and stare into a corner when you came in?
the truth is, though, that nature took its due!
but it was not anything you said or have done that made me blush—it was the fact that i’m just the same as you are
miusov was ready to shout at him but then, containing himself, he said scornfully: you defile everything you touch
please don’t be angry with me, she said
i promised him i would pray, feeling this would please him
although i suppose that after all
well, personally, i ca not complain: a new life has started for me
he was out of breath
and as i was lying here on my sofa, just as i am now, alexei, i suddenly thought to myself: shouldn’t i ask mikhail rakitin to leave my house immediately, because he is being insulting, shouting like this at my guest?
and when you came that time, when i called out to you to come in and asked ivan to come back with you, he gave me a look so full of scorn and hatred that i was seized by a terrible fury and shouted that it was he, he alone, who had convinced me that dmitry was the murderer
sometimes i was very touched by the way he came in the evenings, looking rather sheepishly at me at first, as though asking you are sure i am not disturbing you?
when i die, get another boy, a good one
i was simply talking about varnish, those superficial things, you know, those stupid but socially indispensable graces
that was because they analyzed only the parts and failed to study the whole, showing thereby a truly astonishing blindness
but you do have a chair, i see
my mother was not at the landlady's; she had left and had taken the mother of the girl with her
and that was why he welcomed him so enthusiastically now, feeling that, just from the way he had pulled up to the entrance of the inn, dmitry would be a good person to fleece again
sing, you little bird of god!
stebelkov said slowly, staring at me fixedly with an unbelieving grin
it’s just that i left someone behind in a pretty bad state
i shall act, now, the way he wants me to act
ivan was still gaping at smerdyakov in silence as if his tongue had become paralyzed
as far as i know, maximov has never even been to poland, so how can he speak about it?
you’ll earn yourself a fifty-ruble tip if we get there no more than an hour behind them
the elder zosima entered accompanied by a novice and by alyosha
is not it just a dream?
why, does he sound angry with me?
he disliked the elder at first glance
but i was wrong—he’s still a human being for me
wait a bit, i don’t think i’m lost yet
it may seem rather surprising that, if he was so convinced of this, he had not gone to her in the first place and thus remained, so to speak, within his own social circle, instead of going to a man from a different background, such as samsonov, to whom he did not even know how to talk
for she knows very well that you have no father and that anyone who feels like it can push you around
as i lay with my face turned toward the wall, i suddenly saw in the corner the bright patch of glowing sunlight that i had been anticipating with such disgust
please can i have your hedgehog?
her aunt, mrs fanariotov, who had been outraged over anna's scandalous engagement to the old prince, now, after anna's refusal to accept the money, radically changed her opinion of her niece and solemnly assured her of her respect
on the previous morning, alyosha had not been able to find him anywhere and he had never turned up to meet ivan at the inn
no, i haven’t read it, but i’m planning to
trishatov cried, leaping up
he was indeed a man of character and great conceit, for, after all that had happened, he still hoped grushenka would choose him, so highly did he value himself
but you know that all men must be brothers
there was practically no furniture, just two benches along the walls and two chairs by the unpainted wooden table that had on it, however, a white tablecloth with a pink design
all right, i will give you four, he said, catching up with me when i was already in the yard
now here’s another, even more favorable one
shall i tell them, mitya, my boy?
little arina had not really cost me very much
then he had paid him another visit two weeks later
you know, i’m awfully pleased that you’ve come, terribly pleased!
ivan asked with a laugh
and you, gregory, don’t whimper
look at me, look hard: you see, here, here, something terribly dishonorable is being concocted!
he gulped down one glass of tea and poured himself another
and the point is that you still have not answered our earlier question, namely, why did you divide the money in half, then proceed to squander one half and put the other half aside?
why, didn’t you know that i turned him out of my house?
well, that’s a matter of personal preference
something extremely unpleasant and bothersome, he answered almost angrily
i say that anyone who's honest is entitled to judge
i’m speaking of the ways of women
zershikov was a retired army captain and the tone of his establishment was quite tolerable—militarily curt, businesslike, with a fastidious observance of formalities
of course, he could have put an end to the scene if he had wished, but he himself seemed to be waiting for something, watching attentively, as though he were trying to make up his mind about something that was still unclear to him
he was good to me and took me in when my own family had kicked me out of the house and i was running about barefoot
but who are all the people?
versilov came up behind me
a huge elm rustled faintly overhead
but now it turned out that there was a man living in their former room and that it was not versilov
stunned and filled with despair, the monk went to constantinople, where he begged the ecumenical patriarch to release him from his vow of obedience; but the patriarch explained that neither he nor any power on earth could ever release him from his vow of obedience, and that only the elder who had imposed the command had the power to rescind it
somebody's calling you, zershikov said, pulling at my sleeve
now for number two: why must we part with bitter thoughts of revenge, gnashing our teeth, abusing each other, etc?
i went to see him and spoke to him, but the impression he made on me was altogether different
do you think it’s ridiculous?
but a highly educated man striving for a lofty ideal may sometimes completely lose sight of what is around him and become ridiculous, whimsical, and callous—not only in his practical life, but ultimately even in his own theories
a good half of my generous disposition left me immediately
do you think i wanted to conceal it from you?
all landladies have a favorite lodger whom they treat with special consideration: they clean his room with greater care, sweep his floor more thoroughly, hang lithographs over his sofa, and lay a mangy-looking rug under his table
that stench sometimes made versilov swear aloud and curse his existence, and on that point i fully sympathized with him because i too hate bad smells, even though they could not get all the way to my attic under the eaves, which i reached by very steep and shaky steps
the lights, the chandeliers, the elegant ladies, the dashing officers, the important government officials, the pretty young girls, the rows of chairs, the curtain
a feeling of happiness such as i would never known before penetrated my heart so violently that it even hurt—it was the sensation of universal love encompassing all mankind
why am i done for?
or he may concede the fact and explain it away as a natural phenomenon until then unknown
i want to see her right now, i must give her my blessing!
is it possible that the opportunity will be wasted and nothing will come of it, just because i have no money?
just before i went to grushenka’s that first time, when i intended to beat her up, katerina had sent for me to ask me to go to another town and mail three thousand rubles to her sister agafia in moscow for her, because, for some reason or other, she didn’t want people here to learn about it
millions of articles have been written about it
we’ll have fish soup—a special, fresh one, not today’s heated up
this time, however, i found it quite unbearable and told him i had a headache
i could not understand why
but if that’s the way you feel, the hell with you, he cried, tossing andrei five rubles
her tone was harsh when she said that
something seemed to be in the air
for some reason or other, however, the girl had become particularly attached to versilov
ah, god, how had it happened that all of a sudden i would found myself in a completely different world?
well, done certain things—you can imagine what
wait, i will teach him a lesson!
but when that failed to help, father zosima had advised him, without giving up his prayers and fasting, to take a certain medicine
i see great will power in you, he said, for you were not afraid to do what you considered right in a matter in which you risked making yourself the victim of general contempt
what did he need it for when he already occupied the most exalted position in the world?
among the visitors were many jurists, quite a few famous public figures, and also a number of society ladies
may you be cursed!
still no answer from him
ah, what does he know, your doctor?
the gang to which lambert belonged had been formed in moscow and had already carried out quite a number of operations there (eventually some of the members were caught)
ivan stepped up to the table, took the bundle, and started to unwrap it, but suddenly he let it go and drew his fingers away in horror, as if he had touched something slimy and unbearably revolting
and although he was not a member of the board of directors, he followed the operations of the company with great interest, attended the shareholders' meetings, was elected a founding member, made long speeches, opposed motions, made noise, and obviously had a marvelous time
now, why is it that i never have hysterics?
yes, there used to be such people then
ah, if i had not loved him, i would not have been so overjoyed by his hatred!
now for the essentials of my plan
after all, it was not so far
it was not through any fault of mine that i happened to overhear your secrets
you don’t look yourself
and so he hasn’t been to see me for two weeks now and i started wondering whether he’d ever come back
therefore, with her subtle feminine instinct, anna realized the awkward position she would been maneuvered into: if she said anything against katerina, whom the prince also held in very high esteem (perhaps more now than ever precisely because she had agreed to his marriage plans with such warmth and consideration), if anna made the least attempt to discredit katerina, she would hurt the prince's tender feelings for his daughter, arouse his distrust of her, and perhaps even provoke his indignation
i still do not understand what he meant, but i realize he was in a state of extreme anxiety at that time (i was later to learn the cause of it)
mrs khokhlakov turned toward alyosha and, giving him her elegantly gloved hand, said: she has a message for you, alexei
what interest, mr ivan?
but the stories of his fear of fetyukovich were not quite fair
and once again gregory repeated with stubborn insistence that he had seen the door leading into the garden open
you understand,  i was told, it would be just like having a magazine without a criticism section
i was on my feet
he put on his overcoat
it is because she feels guilty toward him that she hates him so at certain moments, alyosha decided
but then there were many things i would never have dared to utter in her room despite the fact that i felt immensely at ease there
everything that has been written down will be read back to you and if you don’t agree with anything, we will make the necessary changes
as i was saying all this, she slowly rose from her chair, her face growing pinker and pinker
surely it's not just money that worries katerina?
yes, i’m leaving, grushenka said, picking up her shawl from the sofa
i say you spent more than a thousand on them, mr karamazov, trifon brushed off mitya’s protest with great assurance
well, since you have seen that stone, you know how stupid it looks sitting there in the middle of the street, just getting in the way
and she would find out; then she would come and sit down next to me of her own accord, submissive, shy, and tender, hoping to catch my eye, dissolving with joy at the sight of my smile
but you yourself, vasin, spoke of emotional beliefs and feelings yesterday
but what is he afraid of?
people also love anecdotes connected with the court, like the tales about cherny-shev, a seventy-year-old minister of the late tsar who managed to make himself look like a man of thirty so that the tsar himself was amazed
with others, you know, i am the most stern and unsmiling of women!
kalganov suddenly became agitated as if a matter of the utmost importance were at stake
don’t lie to me
he wore an expensive bearskin coat and a sable cap
this is quite inadmissible!
but what offended him most was that he had accepted me too quickly as his friend and had been in too much of a hurry to lower his guard
forget it, mitya said, suddenly smiling
yes, you, because if you stay there, you will lose everything you have!
you are angry with yourself, so you feel the need to take it out on someone else and this time you hope you wo not miss me
sofia, the eighteen-year-old serf girl in question—my mother, that is—had lost both her parents six years earlier
i had not seen my father, versilov, since i was ten, although during that brief encounter he had managed to leave an indelible impression upon me
it is horrible, revolting—i am fully aware of the horror of it
murmuring and protesting when one meets death is a great sin
she goes around barefoot still, but there’s no reason why that should frighten you; don’t turn up your nose at barefoot beggar girls
when ivan had inquired impatiently whether that meant that smerdyakov was insane now, he was told that he was not yet insane in the actual, clinical sense but that certain symptoms of insanity had already been observed
besides, i had no right whatsoever to be so demanding of him about that debt because, once, she said with a determined note in her voice, i had borrowed money from him myself and it was more than three thousand, and i did so although i was not sure at the time when i would be able to pay him back
they never understand one
everybody knows that a month ago you spent not just fifteen hundred rubles, but rather three thousand, here
why do not you try this instead?
he asked in surprise
this feeling may have stemmed indirectly, unconsciously perhaps, from the guilt he felt over having dishonestly spent katerina’s money
what made it even harder for me was that i was trying to describe it in its original, primitive form
i hope the reader will note that i am not sparing myself, that i am presenting myself just as i was at that time, in all my repulsiveness, so that what follows will be understandable
besides, a russian woman is never a woman
the clear reasoning part of her brain must certainly have been aware of her hero's lack of character, for how could one deny that the unfortunate man, although generous in his way, was in fact nothing but a poor mediocrity?
i felt sure that we would be interrupted in the course of the day (that's why my heart was pounding so), in which case perhaps i would not even dare bring up the matter of money
she could, of course, do nothing: crying out for help would have been pointless since we would made sure there were not any witnesses around and, besides, she would have felt rather embarrassed to complain
wouldn’t that be funny, terribly funny?
this was the third time, since his return from moscow, that ivan had been to see smerdyakov
for a minute or so we sat in silence
but he was talking so emotionally, with tears in his eyes, that i began crying myself; when he saw that, he suddenly kissed me and then made the sign of the cross over me
but then, everybody liked the boy, wherever he went, from his early childhood on
you see, perhaps i know much more, as it is, than you do yourself; it’s not information i need from you
at that moment i felt there was nothing i could do that would make any difference
of course i ca not help noticing it, any young man notices it, every child, and a boy who's just beginning to
however, since the witness had first repeatedly denied an incident which he later admitted to, his whole testimony lost much of its credibility and the inn-keeper’s honesty was put very much in question
why, you are a clever peasant, aren’t you?
this question loomed before him like a monstrous ghost and he stared at that ghost, feeling his flesh freeze in terror
the two women rushed into the passage just as they had before, one trying to restrain the other
i didn’t laugh at all
i am sure the papas have heard about perseverance and relentlessness before, but what is needed to achieve my goal is not perseverance and relentlessness as understood by german papas
i’ve been watching her
innkeeper, bring some more bottles!
it must be said that rakitin was one of the witnesses the prosecutor considered extremely important and on whose testimony he reckoned greatly
i would not have dwelt at such length on such a trivial episode had that peculiar meeting between the young civil servant and the by-no-means elderly widow not become the foundation of the whole future career of this meticulous and methodical young man, a fact which is still remembered with amazement in our town and of which we may yet have a few words to say in the sequel to our long novel about the brothers karamazov
i think we really ought to become peasants and till the soil
i remember i spoke about her face
but first let's talk about the business at hand
he asked me to come and see him that day between one and two o'clock because he had something to tell me that would probably come as a surprise
any sensualist can understand that
let's get out of here
although it was far from the center, fyodor karamazov’s house was not altogether on the outskirts of town
true, the arrest of the servant weighed on him heavily, but the man’s illness and sudden death released his conscience from that burden, for, he reasoned at the time, the man did not die from shock or fright caused by his arrest but from a cold he had contracted, probably on the night of the murder, after which he had been found sprawled dead drunk on the damp ground
no, not yet, but it makes absolutely no difference
please, gentlemen, please forgive me for my impatience, he added quickly, checking himself, and once again, believe me, i have the utmost respect for your competence and fully realize the gravity of the situation
moreover, i believe they would have been rather disappointed if his guilt could not have been definitely established, because that would have spoiled the dramatic effect of his acquittal
and so jealousy surged up in him once more
good lord, sir, please
now i’ll hate you again
mon pauvre enfant, i always thought that you must have had many painful moments in your childhood
it's amazing how much older and less handsome you have grown in these nine years!
what was it i had really expected from kraft?
mrs khokhlakov cried, her face suddenly becoming radiant at the sight of perkhotin
and i embraced him and gave him my blessing and i started to cry
and then you will gain not just riches, not just hundreds of thousands or a million, but it will be the whole world that you will gainl today we amass material things without ever satisfying our greed and then we madly squander all we have amassed
do not accuse me of being a slavophile
they were already in the dining room when miusov, kalganov, and ivan karamazov made their entrance
my dear boy, he said, turning to me, i know a cafe around here, a horrible place really, but we could get some tea and i suggest we go there now
you won it, pan podwysocki, we trust your word of honor and we keep ours
'assuming that a supreme being exists,  i said to versilov, 'and exists as a personal entity, not in the form of some diffused creative spirit, a sort of fluid or something (for that would be even harder to imagine), well, if so, where does he reside?
you decided that from my way of walking, madam?
at last mitya looked at his interrogators
it feels as though my double is standing here next to me
however, let me tell you something quite extraordinary that will interest you
and if so, what sort of thing?
how could you say to my face that you were reckoning on my 'impulsiveness'?
father joseph could not refrain from murmuring, shame, shame
but let's drop that for now, since anyway there was no marriage because of lidia's death
but he would not even consider waiting
but life after death—it is such a puzzle and no one, no one at all, has the answer!
he was then searched and examined
the thought that was tormenting me was this: if he was really spiritually regenerated and now free of his passion for her, where would he most likely be at this moment?
my guiding idea, or rather my feelings, simply amounted to leaving them once and for all (just as i had resolved a thousand times before), but this time i was determined really to do it
you’re the only one i’m not afraid of
you stole it from my poem!
taken individually, they may be little angels, but in a crowd they’re completely without pity
to be on the safe side, i decided to stay out of arguments, to say as little as possible, so that no one could say anything about me, but, above all, not to get involved in the discussion
and how do you know, my dear boy, that there are no hooks?
ivan took the three bundles of bills and shoved them into his pocket without wrapping them in anything
how could you love a man like that?
there will always be some lovely scullery maid for her master, and that’s all that’s needed to make one happy!
having said this, ivan, without waiting for the judge’s permission, got up and started to walk away from the witness stand
across the table from him, nikolai nelyudov, the examining magistrate, was trying to convince him to take a sip from a glass of water that stood on the table next to him
and that wouldn’t be so surprising either, lise—you may very well drive me to hysterics with these whims of yours!
the apostle thomas said he would not believe until he saw, and when he saw, he said: my lord and my god!
there was that fellow belyavsky, rich, good-looking, and all, who took a fancy to her and would hang around here all the time
it’s all false, false, false!
he repeated to himself for the hundredth time, the very thought making him blush
and trishatov's expression was gloomy and sad as he stood looking at me, with his hands in his pockets and without taking off his hat
in fact, i am pretty sure it must have been
in that case, alyosha, i’ll make a clean breast of everything, for there must be someone who knows the whole truth
what about my idea?
no, let me make a clean breast of it now
you mean there’s just nothing, just a vacuum?
yes, it was really great!
but then i thought up something else
i want to think only of sweet alyosha, while i look at him
he was a very dangerous opponent, even though, because of his vow of silence, he hardly ever spoke to anyone
you may be wrong there!
but nelyudov, who stood nearest to him, quickly and nervously hid his hands behind his back
vanya, how will all this horrible business end between father and mitya?
this caused the opponents of the elders to accuse them, among other things, of arbitrarily and irresponsibly degrading the sacrament of confession, although the continual baring of a novice’s or a layman’s soul before his elder was quite different from that sacrament
but without doubt the overwhelming majority of the monks were on zosima’s side, and many of them loved him deeply and sincerely
considering, however, the damage he could do himself by refusing to answer, especially with questions as important as this one, he should perhaps
this has always been his way of dealing with his children, legitimate or illegitimate
then, two years later, he sued me for that sum and with the accumulated interest too, and then surprised me again by literally going around and begging coppers for the building of a church
what does it matter one way or the other, my boy?
and with all those people in town against him, constantly saying he’s the murderer!
lise laughed nervously again
but could it really be due to your friendship with that princeling?
surely it must have occurred to him that anna might very well have been aware of his liaison with lisa, since they were after all sisters, or, if she did not yet know of it, she was very likely to find out about it sooner or later
so let's get down to business now
his face had turned dark purple and he was shaking all over
or perhaps we could put it this way: it’s not an attempt to conciliate him, to stop him from lodging a complaint—i understand he was thinking of suing dmitry—it’s simply out of sympathy, out of a desire to help him
tell me, your excellency,  i asked him, is it possible for a true lady to breathe fresh air into herself?
but before miusov could answer this sarcasm, they were asked to come in
they needed four and a half thousand and, in addition, they lost about two hundred rubles in cashing the letter of credit
there are simple and unaffected souls who trust everybody and are not aware of the ridiculous
but you need not worry, it just came up when we were talking about something else
she was almost out of breath
i’m anything you like, but not a thief
and if it is true that children share the responsibility for the sins committed by their fathers, then that concept must be true in some different world from the world i know, and it is quite beyond my grasp
well, there may be: versilov acted a bit too quickly and perhaps not all that sincerely really, vasin said with a smile
yes, i have, mitya said with a sly wink
today is the finale of the last act and the curtain will come down
where is she, where?
a dog’s death for a dog!
mitya asked and started turning out one pocket after the other
on another occasion he would have waited until the effect produced by perezvon had worn off
he felt it during that moment of rapture
and no one saw us then, no one except god, and i only hope that he will put it into my service record; if so, you can thank your dear brother for me, mr alexei karamazov, but i’m afraid i won’t give my boy a whipping even to satisfy you
so he left stamping his feet
i wish you would heard him in those days when he kept cornering everyone and asking them such things as 'what do you eat?
so you’ve come back from the dead, have you, von sohn?
but whose responsibility is it that he became like that?
why don’t you stop carrying on about that?
besides, i will have a lot to say about him as i go on with my story
for that too, arkady, i have to rely on your influence on him, and i know how fond of him you are
there's no crowd there
oh, no doubt of it—everybody is fine in his own way
yes, since thut time he's had eyes for no one but me
on the other hand, your other brother, mr ivan, sent me very early this morning to mr dmitry’s place on lake street, to tell mr dmitry—he gave me no letter to deliver—to be at the inn on the square today without fail and that they’d eat lunch together there
then why are you shaking?
ah, you ignorant creature,  i say, do you think you’re going to teach me or what?
did you say it wasn’t?
lambert is a realist!
he had been terribly anxious to see ivan ever since the morning
what about starting with god?
but who could it be?
now, let's be on our way, peter!
my dear fellow, let me tell you—intelligence isn’t everything
and now i have no idea what to do about it
i sat down at his table and told him everything i would learned about lisa and sergei and about my scene with sergei the previous night following the session at the roulette table, mentioning, of course, my win
i do not want to and i am not going to
no one tried to stop me from leaving and i did not go into the living room to say good-by to my mother as i did not want to see versilov again
not just you and versilov but also anna versilov, who is just as much your sister as lisa dolgoruky!
besides these three, i can only remember two faces, one belonging to a tall twenty-seven-year-old man with black sideburns, a teacher or something, who spoke with great volubility, and a young fellow, my age perhaps, with a peculiar frown, who wore a russian peasant's coat and mostly listened, saying little
and if this, or something of the sort, could have happened, doesn’t that make the whole charge of theft quite unfounded?
he pointed at the case with the pistols
she asked me about makar and his death; i told her and one might have assumed it was over makar's death that i was crying, although at this point that would have been quite ridiculous and she could not possibly have thought me capable of such childish sentimentality
i have read the book against which you argue in your article, he said, turning to ivan, and i was quite taken aback by the words the church is a kingdom not of this world’ coming from an ecclesiastic
that’s very probable, alyosha cried excitedly
that mysterious warning made me lose my temper completely
no, he can’t, because he’s too ignorant to have any feelings at all
and so when she agrees to everything, i mean when she pays up the money as well as the other ransom—in kind, you know (she's sure to agree, being vile like all women)—just at that moment, versilov and i will burst in to witness her ignominy
he got up from his armchair and started pacing up and down the room, apparently unaware of it himself
besides, the accused accounted clearly and without equivocation for the origin of that money, and his explanation, i submit, is very much in keeping with the accused’s personality and character
and i did not feel like weeping now; instead, a feeling of spite quite unexpectedly got hold of me
at last the maid had finished lighting the fire
she’s really impossible today, and i’m afraid she’ll only get more irritated if we stay
and combined with such a charming manner and such good looks!
in fact, everything that i have been describing in such seemingly unnecessary detail will be understood at the proper time
there's no need for him to make up for anything: i simply do not want to have anything to do with him, i do not!
yes, i remember, until, until
please go and see her, alyosha, and ask her not to say anything about that in court
the presiding judge rang his bell with all his might
no, i haven’t been introduced to her, but i’ve heard of her and i’ve seen her
the wailing only assuages by further lacerating and exasperating the heart
you do often go to see her, and you told me yourself that you’d never been her lover
and the conviction that, after his death, zosima would confer great glory on the monastery was, perhaps, stronger in alyosha than in anyone else at the monastery
he stayed at the paternal house only a short time, leaving as soon as he had managed to get a very small sum from the old man, together with some vague agreement about sending him the revenue from his estate
that’s just his normal way of shaking hands, grushenka said, smiling but still looking apprehensively at dmitry
i think you are exaggerating the importance of the whole thing
please do—of course, the examining magistrate said
ah, how you like to play games, lisa!
until very recently alyosha had felt that this was a quite inconceivable slander, but it had nevertheless worried him a great deal
this one was not dressed like a pilgrim but wore ordinary town clothes
it must sound like some crazy story to you, like some ballad in prose, and, of course, you’re not at all likely to believe a fellow!
i will try to convey just the gist of what i heard, for the chances are that i missed many details: i was too excited to take in everything
so he never told even you, mother?
at any rate, there's too much guesswork involved
you’re thinking about the obscenities in it?
and why won’t he acknowledge it?
it may sound paradoxical too that what i liked most about the letter (just a small sheet of note paper) was the fact that there was no mention of my entering the university, no attempt to persuade me to reconsider my decision and to complete my education; in short, he did not indulge in all those paternal pretty phrases that are used in such cases
the very thought of what will happen just kills me!
they’re breeding all over the place these days!
and why would he kill the old man?
first, a recitative, played very softly, but full of suffering and terror, while the choir thunders grimly, sternly, and impersonally,  wouldies irae, dies illa!
but prince sokolsky will never accept your challenge, lisa said
so i first inquired about his wife's health and we went to pay her a visit
my answer to that is: who were the people who knew he didn’t have any money?
and it was with love that i looked at him—i am certain of it, for i knew now what to do
there stebelkov is completely wrong, vasin said with a special emphasis that struck me and that i still remember very clearly
you really see no difference?
he did not keep the fasts according to the rules of his order—that is why the sign is here
but we will come to that later
but it was not only her hands that she was ashamed of; she was ashamed of everything about herself, although it was her beauty that i loved
and here i would like to suggest, in all humility, that perhaps this very awareness of the impossibility of loving might lead to an eventual alleviation of the sinners’ torments, for, by accepting the love of the righteous along with the impossibility of their responding to it, through the resignation and humility which would result from that acceptance, they might come to experience a feeling resembling the active love they neglected on earth
as to mitya’s striking him in the face and knocking him down, gregory said that he held no grudge for that and had forgiven him long ago
vasin kept smiling and did not seem in the least surprised
in this promise, as in any other the dying elder had ever made, father paisii believed so completely that, had he seen father zosima unconscious and no longer breathing after he had promised to get up and say good-by to him, he would have distrusted even death itself and expected the dying man to regain consciousness and carry out his promise
it was a bedroom with trunks and suitcases next to two large beds, which were piled high with pillows in cotton calico covers
katya has despised me for months—i’ve been aware of it
i never expected such an outburst from you!
ivan lowered his eyes, waited for a few moments, and then looked up again and said with a sort of stammer:
you must ask your landlady, lambert, to rent us another room, and it's there that i will be waiting with versilov
in the meantime, they had walked quite a distance down the path and suddenly smurov cried:
there's no other kind of friendship; there ca not be; it's just a myth invented by impractical people
it was a small, folded, sealed sheet of paper
here, fenya, get him a candle
i see that you know everything!
i feel very sorry for lisa
would you like a wet towel on your head?
the two villagers and andrei confirmed unhesitatingly what trifon had said
yes, i just dream and dream; my whole life has become nothing but a daydream until i daydream even at night
i am sure you disagree with me
he glanced quickly at the door, looked around him, and, leaning toward me from the sofa, said in anxious whispers:
no one answered him
were you hoping to bring the man you had struck back to life?
a thick book in a yellow cover lay on the table, but smerdyakov was not reading it and, in fact, seemed to have been just sitting there doing nothing
well, i thought it was an opening for some amiable chit-chat, so i said, why, yes, sir, i must say i have
i would given the matter of food lots of thought: i decided, for instance, sometimes to eat nothing but bread and salt for two days in a row and then on the third day spend on food whatever i would saved from my daily allowance
prince sergei, i whispered
go on, go on, find out!
his face had changed with the usual speed
unless you, too, believe that running away would be dishonorable, unheroic, or what have you—perhaps un-christian?
life is so good when you do something that is good and just
all the rest of the world is just wonderful!
well, this happened early in our nineteenth century, during the darkest days of serfdom—and, by the way, long live our tsar alexander ii, the liberator of the people!
well, for your information, alexei, your dear brother is a low, despicable man
he kissed both her hands again and gently stroked her cheeks; then he took the napkin from the table and wiped away her tears with it
nekrasov describes the poor, feeble nag, trying in vain to pull an overloaded cart which is stuck in the mud
he looked less self-assured than he had the day before but was in a state of great excitement like a man who finds himself at the center of very important events
for one thing, he drank too much, so much, in fact, that he had not been able to get a job any more and had to live on handouts before maxim had hired him
i knew he needed money and i knew what he needed it for: it was to entice that creature to go away with him
if they think evil of him now, the thought flashed through my head, let them know the whole truth!
alyosha and the boys followed close behind him
there are many of them, and we all bear the responsibility for them!
and it was not just the way he treated me that won me over
i called out to katerina again and rushed after the carriage
the prosecutor said he did not wish’ or dare’—those are his own words—to touch upon that romance
as to the letter about which i had come to seek his advice earlier, i did not mention it and told him that i would just come to pay him a friendly visit before
he could stand on his feet, he could speak, but who knows what was going on inside him?
what did you two quarrel about this time?
there was no bidding
i can see that you have all kinds of silly ideas about things
he looked happy and there was a spark of joy in his eyes
in fact, i rejoiced inwardly, because i felt that god had taken mercy on that man, who had risen up against himself and had asked for the punishment he deserved
i’d just laugh in their faces!
one of them is a young gentleman, a relative of mr miusov’s i believe, but i’ve forgotten his name
no, there’s obviously something else to it, something quite original
the elder moved toward dmitry and, when he was close to him, he went down on his knees before him
today everyone asserts his own personality and strives to live a full life as an individual
but at times he also suspected that ivan’s lack of interest and sympathy might be due to other causes about which he knew nothing
so it was you who had that letter sewn up inside your pocket!
i must check on that
but i don’t want to believe, and there’s nothing that will make me believe, in you!
and just as she had before, she stopped him in the hall
he did know the prince but would not tell me under what circumstances he would met him
i kissed him enthusiastically
since the age of twelve, i believe, when i became fully conscious of things, i have disliked my fellow men
yes, at one moment he looked at me and my heart was filled with horror at what that man was preparing for himself
but what i am interested in is what will become of him
gentlemen of the jury, what is a father, a real father?
no, i am no prince, i am just plain dolgoruky, and i am the son of my former master, mr versilov
then i disposed of my dinner by throwing the soup either out the window into the nettles or you know where and feeding the meat to the dog or, wrapping it up in paper, smuggling it out in my pocket and flingling it far away from the house
er, but then it must be done at once, right away, without delay!
so why did you have to humiliate yourself like that before an impudent upstart, a mere adolescent like me?
there are quite a few things you’ll have to explain to me, my good fellow, and you’d better get out of your head, once and for all, the notion that you can play games with me!
yes, my brothers too, alyosha said, with some hesitation
nevertheless, he still resists it and goes first to see mrs khokhlakov, one of the most respected citizens in our town
when a little bird sings or all those many, many stars shine in the sky at night—it's all mystery, the same one
what if i should put a curse on you?
but i have mother, i have lisa
ah, we’re all so glad you’re here
he said, examining the bottle
of course, the presiding judge and the prosecutor tried to calm her, and i’m sure they felt rather embarrassed at taking advantage of her hysterical outburst to hear her confession
again, they assured him that, although mr kalganov was a little taller and somewhat slighter, he was exaggerating the difference in their builds, that the clothes fitted well enough, except perhaps the trousers, which were a bit too long
although, as i write this down now, the conversation strikes me as rather funny, especially my style of that period, my feelings on the subject have remained unchanged
that same winter she was with child, and they went from church to church and prayed while waiting in fear and trembling for god's verdict
that would be hopeless anyway, for, as they say, you may throw nature out the door, but it will come back through the window
your brains must be turning soft!
listen, in dreams and particularly in nightmares, caused perhaps by indigestion or whatever, a man may think up such artistic creations, such complex and realistic visions, events or even a whole world of events woven into a plot full of such astounding details that leo tolstoi himself could not invent them
no, sir, she didn’t
he said quietly, and looked searchingly at every one of us in turn
in general, this is a peculiar feature of simple people: they are never contented with an abstract idea and always demand concrete and precise details
he looked at me piteously
he was almost choking
and i myself, do you imagine i’ll be able to live there among those completely strange natives, even though every one of them may be a much better man than i am
nothing doing, not like that
well, i want you to know that i was deliberately testing you—i wanted to find out if it was possible to get along with you, whether there was room for my humility next to your pride
i think i forgot something here, he said, my handkerchief or something
i didn’t think it would make much difference at that point whether i died a thief or a man of honor
yes, i saw him
how could you imagine that i would consider going to prince nikolai and asking him to lend me money after what you have just told me?
but now that is quite clear to me
this is a heroic deed on your part
this tone and the casual way in which alyosha had accepted came as such a surprise to rakitin that he almost jumped back upon hearing it
so let’s go, fellow
however i will take all the punishment and tell it to the end
that was rather clever, i must say!
perkhotin said, sounding really worried now
i understand why you got a bit carried away, misha—from your heated tone i guess you’re not quite indifferent to katerina yourself
it is by blessing that one is blessed
this is the explanation i have to offer now as i look back at that episode, although at the time i had other things to think of than an analysis of my actions
when it got dark and the shutters were closed, fenya asked grushenka:
and he even wept
she was listening, he muttered angrily to himself, but alyosha heard him
anyone seeing his face would have understood that he was not laughing because he felt in a laughing mood
and now to go on with my story
as soon as the public was seated, there was complete silence
yes, he did, grushenka said with a sigh
tell me, what do you think they will do to them?
yes, that’s just what he said
did your brother tell you that he planned to kill his father?
with you alone i feel like a decent person at certain moments, for i’m really a wicked man
then martha takes a towel, dips it in the solution, and rubs it all over his back for maybe half an hour, until the towel is completely dry, and usually her face is all red by the time she’s through
you know nothing about women of that type, and i’ve heard that this one is the worst of them all
ivan asked dmitry to meet him at the inn for lunch today?
mitya was anxious to tell everything with the utmost accuracy and in all possible detail
but when he saw me at sergei's, he never even made a hint to remind me about that note of his
but all the time he watched smerdyakov with great curiosity
what sort of nonsense is that?
the general demanded, and he was informed that the boy had hit it with a stone
then he adjusted the red kerchief more becomingly around his head
i know only too well how it all came about
and shall i tell you who told me?
on the bed on the right, there was only one little pillow
he had wanted to meet him for a long time
oh, we were all so anxious to do good in those days, to do our duty as citizens, to serve a higher ideal; we wanted to do away with all class privileges and distinctions, with our family estates, and even with pawnshops, at least some of us did
your landlord was blabbering something, but since he could not tell me where you were i left in such a huff that i even forgot to leave a message with him that you should come to the house as quickly as possible
i was well aware that my comrades laughed at me and despised me for this, but that was just what gave me special pleasure: well, since you wanted me to be a lackey, i became a lackey, and if you wish me to be a pig, i will be a pig!
tonight he’ll think of it even more, he’ll dream of it, and by morning perhaps he’ll be ready to hurry to me and beg me to forgive him
what makes it so particularly disgraceful to separate fifteen hundred from three thousand that you had anyway appropriated rather shamefully, even disgracefully?
he’ll never give it to you, mitya
i mean to apologize to him in whatever way he considers satisfactory
and you, charlemagne, napoleon, shakespeare, and pushkin!
but time was running short and agafia, who was to look after the children as soon as she came in, had not yet returned from market
evidently the landlady, and perhaps the other lodgers, had rushed to the room next door
in my great ability to accommodate myself to anything, which is so characteristic of the russian intellectuals of our generation
but that’s realism, sir, sheer realism!
now, by dispatching daria to me with that address, anna seemed to have planned this move in advance and it struck me as quite cynical: despite my refusal to cooperate with her, she dismissed what i would said as mere pretense and was sending me to deal with lambert directly
can you remember all that, misha?
i most certainly will
you say she got out of there without kissing it!
as for you, most holy man, allow me only to express my profound admiration!
i suspect it may be an awful decision, but i feel i will stick by it as long as i live and nothing will make me change it
but with every day that is left to me i feel that my earthly life is already blending into a new, infinite, unknown, future life, anticipation of which sets my soul atremble with ecstasy, makes my mind glow and my heart weep with joy
i have received enough embroidery from them to cover a good sixty cushions with nothing but dogs and deer!
you’re a karamazov, as much a karamazov as the rest; your breed and natural selection must count for something
but the main reason for the church’s keeping aloof is that the law of the church is the only true law and it cannot, therefore, make the slightest concession to any other law or even accept a temporary compromise
well, that's a mystery to me
his tone was frank and unaffected as he addressed the elder
and i want you to know, my dear boy, that all warnings and salutary advice are nothing but gratuitous impositions upon another man's conscience
what do you mean—deliberately?
but if i were rothschild, where would piron or even talleyrand be if they tried to outshine me?
my ability to reason and even my capacity to feel were drained so that if i would given in and committed a crime (which i almost did!
besides, it will be more seemly for you to live in the monastery than to stay here with an old drunkard like me, and with all these sluts, though nothing could sully you, clean angel that you are
what do you mean, it isn’t real?
it's a long time since i have been angry with anyone
to which piece of information, the fellow's only comment was: tu-lu-lu!
i can see the sun, and if i can’t see the sun, i know there is the sun
i restrained myself for a long time, but suddenly it became more than i could bear and i told him, in the presence of all my family, that he was wasting his time and mine in coming to see me, that i would recover just as well without him, that, although he pretended to be a realist, he was filled with all sorts of superstitions and prejudices, that he refused to understand that medicine had never healed anyone, that he seemed to be crassly ignorant, and that recently anybody who claimed to be a technician or an expert of some sort in russia treated people as if they were dirt
at first versilov instinctively held his head between his shoulders so as not to hit the ceiling, but he soon realized that there was headroom where he stood; he relaxed and sat down on the sofa, now looking quite at ease; it did not seem to bother him at all that my bed had already been made up
come, join us, sit down, have some coffee—it’s lenten, for sure, but it’s nice and hot!
as long as there were still atoms, the five senses, the four elements, well, it all fitted together somehow
your past relations and quarrels with her are, of course, quite an unsuitable subject for us to discuss, and i am sure it would have been just plain stupid for me to try and bring it up
i cannot speak for the others but, on me personally, mitya made a most unpleasant impression
it was ugly, unfair, and unkind
vigilant alphonsine cried out at once
there are simple and loving hearts that must be treated with gentle care whenever possible
vasin heard me out attentively but with complete detachment
even if father wishes to tell me a secret, there’s still no reason why ivan shouldn’t see me come in
what the russian people need is flogging, as mr karamazov said yesterday, and he was right, crazy as he is with those sons of his
i want to know—that's what i am trying to find out from you
i want everything brought up and opened as soon as it arrives, and i want the champagne served immediately
he smiled again, but now almost with hatred in his look
perhaps she had no control over the circumstances and could not change them?
now, what about you, would it be going too far for you to have a drink with me?
all the time i was playing the fool i was secretly listening and observing, and now it’s time for me to give you the last act of my performance
besides, agafia will feed you
kuzma samsonov must have seen all this within a minute, although his face remained cold and expressionless, like the face of an idol
and the same goes for an englishman or a german
how does he come down to you, in what shape?
but he never gave a thought at the time to the fact that he had shed innocent blood and taken the life of a human being
the main thing about it was that it was humiliating for him, whereas they were in a position to treat him with condescension and contempt
smurov told me about it
they will marvel at us and worship us like gods, because, by becoming their masters, we have accepted the burden of freedom that they were too frightened to face, just because we have agreed to rule over them—that is how terrifying freedom will have become to them finally!
indeed, i found it very funny
finally general akhmakov began to give in, realizing the determination of his lovesick daughter, who, as kraft put it, had been mesmerized by versilov
why are you trembling?
the prosecutor turned to the examining magistrate and in a gravely decisive tone told him:
yes, but he’s here too
she asks you to forgive her for having told papa about the money
also, i remembered what anna had made me understand the day before to my great surprise—namely, that the old prince might make use of my apartment to get married
i said, no longer restraining myself
can’t we go without them?
just about fifteen minutes earlier, grushenka had left for mokroye
yes, that but’ is just the thing!
you’ve no need to be in such a rush to get rid of it all
well, you see then, the landlord cried with obvious relief; he had not noticed versilov's wink and was pleased to be allowed to continue his story, hoping there would not be any further heckling
mitya answered smartly and clearly, but somehow in an unexpectedly loud voice that made the presiding judge sit up slightly, looking almost surprised
he added in complete hopelessness
the prosecutor had been watching him all the time he was talking and when he had finished he remarked in a cold, detached tone, almost casually:
also, he had no doubts that it would be to him and to no one else that i would go the day i was strong enough to leave the house: daria had come to see me partly on his orders, so he knew that my curiosity and my fears had already been aroused and reckoned that i would not be able to hold out
the sickness lasted eight days
so it's me who's insisting, and you must know why
i only registered her saying that it was all sham, the outpourings of a despicable mind, moreover deliberately twisted and turned inside out
i noticed that this former university student was surprisingly ignorant and that practically nothing interested him
where are you, ma?
and you have already repeated it to grushenka
he had only forgotten gott der heilige geist, but i reminded him of it and i again felt very sorry for him
he repeated to her his entire conversation with smerdyakov, every word of it, and was unable to relax despite all her efforts to calm him
but all these rumors and arguments did not in the least change the general sympathy for the poor holy fool; in fact, the opposite was true—people showed even more kindness and concern for her
he has exhausted you!
you’re right, absolutely right
as a matter of fact, i may still kill someone, even if i remain rich, for what use is it to just sit around doing nothing?
ivan cried, a very worried look appearing on his face
don’t worry, soon you’ll be able to go to bed and get some sleep
in gogol, too, you understand, it’s all meant allegorically, for all the names he gives his characters are allegorical too
not really, versilov said, getting up and reaching for his hat
do not get angry, arkasha, mother said, but it would be so nice if you could really stop
for it was the time when they were proclaiming atheism
his use of the word document had given me a jolt
even if his act was very brave, i still think he would not have sinned if he had renounced christ on that occasion, as well as his own baptismal vows, so as to save his life for good works, which in time would have made up for his moment of weakness
but five or six months later, the town discovered with shock and horror that lizaveta was pregnant
he had even slipped into a sort of light-headedness
only an hour ago i thought i would not be able to bring myself to touch that monster, just as i can’t touch reptiles
what is so strange and extraordinary is not that god really exists but that such a thought—the very idea of the necessity of god—should have occurred to a vicious wild animal like man, for that concept is so holy, so touching, and so wise that it does man too much honor
dmitry stood up, held a finger to his forehead, and for a moment stood there deep in thought
indeed, the reader might be sufficiently taken in to believe that a scene from past history could take place in the present
i couldn’t catch her
you’ll tell me about it next sunday!
and the girls—you could get them out of bed, like the other time
he looked extremely uneasy, feeling certain that a scandal would be unavoidable now
it was very late, but ivan had still not gone to bed
i had, of course, never seen her before and i could not imagine how i would talk to her, if i were to talk to her at all
i have chosen it not for any special reason except that somehow i remember it best
i’ve long considered you an exceptional person and respected you, kolya started again, feeling he was about to get mixed up
and that was the man stebelkov wanted
the truth is that during the entire preceding day, despite all my shocking experiences, my thoughts had kept returning to my success at zershikov's gambling saloon
you’re leaving me now?
so i raised my finger and i said to him: my boy,  i said, gott der vater
forgive me, please, i was under the impression, ivan, that—ha-ha-ha!
take me away, grushenka said weakly
what he thought of me i don’t know, but i do know that if the same circumstances were repeated today, i would react in exactly the same way, show the same emotions, use the same words, make the same gestures, the same movements
tell me, is he in love with her too?
before he fell asleep, he prayed for mitya and for ivan
i was thinking that even if i believed that life was pointless, lost faith in the woman i loved, lost faith in the order of things, or even became convinced that i was surrounded by a disorderly, evil, perhaps devil-made chaos, even if i were completely overcome by the horrors of human despair—i would still want to live on; once i have started drinking from this cup, i won’t put it down until i have emptied it to the last drop
he suddenly stood up and started pacing the room
quite an adventurous lady otherwise, is not she!
he was very well aware of this, but he pretended it was gregory who had asked them
all right—it was mr miusov here, who just now was so furious about diderot
oh no, it damn well makes all the difference in the world, because if there’s no ceiling, there aren’t any hooks either, and if there aren’t any hooks, then the whole idea goes to pieces
so a well-dressed lady walked in and asked is it you who advertised about lessons in the newspaper?
that’s my motto, children, my own dear little suckling pigs
but then, in the mood i was in, nothing would have pleased me
suddenly it struck him that ivan rolled slightly as he walked, listing to the right, so that from behind it seemed to alyosha that his right shoulder was lower than his left
i must therefore explain right now what mrs prutkov meant by the noose when she blurted out that word
yes, my best regards, just like that
i mean in obtaining your acquittal
it was, indeed, nothing more than a hut
so i decided to write a letter of appreciation to the newspapers—that’s how grateful i felt!
actually, i’m only doing it for your sake, he told our mother
why would you go to see her otherwise?
now i feel the presence of god and my heart rejoices
what he needed was a draftsman, an artist, an engraver, a lithographer, and also a chemist and a technician  all this for a certain specific purpose
i rapped out from the doorway
you know, there’s someone here i love, and guess who it is?
this was the baron
we’ll return to russia as american citizens
there’s your father over there
i gave you money that belonged to me and you knew it and took it, while i had to bear that loathsome comedy in my own house!
who knows what could happen
he is a future member of the diplomatic corps, i’m certain!
the children now looked at the powder with an awe which increased their fascination still more
i felt that it could have awful consequences later, such as slander, and, alas, that is indeed what eventually came out of it!
his second marriage lasted eight years
and it was the indefinable origin of his anxiety that was causing it to increase in him now
he appeared meek and subdued
at night, in the darkness, i’d sob into my pillow, thinking of it all the time, trying to calm myself by repeating again and again: i’ll pay him back, i’ll pay him back, for everything, everything’
i decided to take care of the child with your mother's permission
alyosha noticed it and compassion stirred in his heart
i am willing to yield to her because she's the weaker creature, but why should she take it for granted and consider it my duty?
and who will accept what you say of freedom in the way you want it to be understood?
grushenka in her house?
this strange remark was almost the last line of the entry
there are moments when people love crime, alyosha said thoughtfully
maxim sat there like in a stupor
you could have guessed because i was pleading with you to go to chermashnya instead of moscow, that’s how
she didn’t like ivan, though, and was cool toward him
he, at least, has something to be sad about: he has revolted against his god and was even getting ready to devour some salami
he was aiming at you!
was he named for alexei the man of god?
my client grew up under no one’s protection but god’s, which means he grew up as wild animals do
she was frightened by the shouting and hid herself in the bushes
mr karamazov was unable to show his son where he had buried his second wife for, once the coffin had been lowered into the earth, he had never returned to visit her grave and, since that had been many years before, he had entirely forgotten where the grave was
no pity, no compassion for lisa, could stop me now
the elder smiled gently
she ignored my remark and suddenly started to talk
oh, there are a thousand witnesses who will tell you that!
i don’t know how to put it, but i’ve observed it myself
wait, he said, the boy had not haunted me all year until now, but last night he came to me in my dream
for more than a month he had been hearing from various sources that ivan was in love with katerina and, above all, that he was trying to take her away from mitya
but how can i tell you what i so long to tell you?
nekrasov has a poem in which a peasant whips his horse, aiming at the animal’s eyes—the horse’s gentle eyes
karamazov proceeded immediately to exploit his son’s weakness, putting him off with small sums
and now let me tell you the whole truth, gentlemen!
for the time being, ivan writes theological articles, although he is an atheist and admits that he does not seriously mean what he says in them, and he does it all for some strange, idiotic reasons
and how's your sister lisa?
alyosha yelled in pain, trying to pull his finger away
well, the intelligent people
but what choice did i have?
first of all, though, they made a thorough investigation and found that it really was possible to flatten oneself out between the rails so that the train would pass over you without touching you; but to actually lie still while the thing rattled deafeningly over your head—that was something else again!
let me tell you once and for all what i think about that, mitya
my god—i haven’t seen so much money in four years!
listen, did you laugh at me very much when you read it?
i picked an unrelated pretext, trying to ridicule his opinion on an important political event—this was in
so, holy men, you can see what kind of a father he is—whether he has the right to accuse his son of disorderly behavior!
we finally succeeded in making the mother drink two cups of tea, even if it took a lot of pleading, persuading, and almost force
but who's talking about dying, prince?
mitya ran at full speed, and the few people he passed were to testify later that they had seen him galloping madly through the streets on that particular night
and as i was telling him, he all of a sudden jumped up and started swearing like a madman
i stared at her, my eyes almost popping out, so much so, in fact, that i began to see double and saw two alphonsines in front of me
anyway, i had decided to hear him out to the end
tell me, why did you come out and talk to me just now after all that had happened?
as the visiting monk recounted later, he approached the shack with immense apprehension
oh, i agree with the court and the prosecution that ivan karamazov was feverish and that his testimony could have been a desperate attempt, perhaps conceived in a feverish state, to save his brother by blaming a dead man for the crime
when, thus silenced, kostya still felt his sister was wrong, he would appeal to kolya, whose verdict was final and could not be appealed further
but that money you showed me just now
the interrogators were extremely interested to hear that mitya had offered the pole three thousand rubles—seven hundred rubles down, the balance of twenty-three hundred to be paid in town in the morning
that's only what people say who have never tried anything, who have never even started to live, and who have grown stiff from sitting motionless amidst things as they found them
the leader of the two, that is, the little pole, turned out to be a retired civil servant of the twelfth class, who had served in siberia as a veterinarian
well, he’s the one i had in mind
the questioners were silent for a moment
they were sitting facing each other at the table at which versilov and i had so recently drunk to his regeneration
listen, alyosha, ivan will surpass everybody
behind him could be seen a whole crowd of monks who had accompanied him, and even some laymen too
i thought i must have done something wrong but that i would mend my ways somehow and would be forgiven
i’d have beaten her mercilessly!
i wept then and put my arms around him and kissed him
why, the earthly queen, of course, that ideal of yours!
you’re just like her, just like the crazy woman
he was pleased to predict on that occasion that, if i decided in the near future that the career of an archimandrite was not for me, and that i would not be tonsured, i would be sure to go off to petersburg, that i would get myself onto the staff of some thick magazine, in the literary section, of course
then she wept and now she plunges the knife into katya’s heart
i can just imagine a polish gambler giving away a million like that!
her face was contorted
dead people smell even worse
it’s impossible to tell in advance when one is going to have a fit
and she certainly knew how to listen, something i would always been very bad at
when the old man appeared at the opposite end of the room, about sixty feet away from him, mitya stood up at once and walked toward the old man with his long, firm military stride
where’s the wise governor of the feast?
in fact, i had a feeling that she would come especially with that purpose in mind
so now we are even
that i can tell, and that's why i sent them packing
everything took place in an atmosphere of squalor and dirt, which, indeed, must have held an attraction for some people
all this, you did not think it up yourself
i was very pale
did you hear, porfiry?
in the dresden museum there's a claude lorrain painting listed in the catalogue as 'acis and galatea,  but i somehow always called it 'the golden age
mitya cried, opening his eyes, sitting up on the trunk as if he had come to after a fainting fit, and smiling brightly
i think that's so terribly true!
but the end will come soon and they will have to pay dearly for their fun
ivan’s face twitched in a peculiar way
i have that feeling, and i could have it just from being so afraid
grushenka leapt up at once
i swear it's true
you see, my back-scrubber used to be thicker before, i mean, no more than a week ago—i’m referring, of course, to my beard, which the schoolboys have nicknamed a back-scrubber
that’s right, they’re not asleep!
it would only be one more terrible sin toward my departed little darlings
none of this became known until later, but while he was alive samsonov did help grushenka with advice on how to run her own operations and he would now and then throw some good thing her way
he claims, for one thing, that in the ’s, our cavalry all got themselves polish wives
they were examining large bloodstains on the back of the coat, especially down the left side
what have i done?
her gentle eyes were dreamy and she did not look like someone waiting with apprehension for something to happen
he was fully conscious of this
i am well aware that that young gentleman is in dire straits himself and i do not consider that he owes me anything, his promises notwithstanding
otherwise, why did not they think of it themselves, the stupid fools!
what i was trying to say was that my head is there and also the head of that monster
tell me about last night, arkady, about that girl
lean close to me once again, ivan
but why talk about it
well, we’ll fight then, but i’ll love her, love her no end
alyosha unbound his bitten finger
and it was the same thing on sundays
he’s a dragon
and now as soon as she walked in, i knew she could not fail to attack me
you have no idea, mr karamazov, how nasty he is!
indeed, only when he heard that i was the one who had the letter did the prince really believe that there must be some truth in what he was being told—that's how great was his trust in me!
i do not know that either, prince, except that it must be something awfully simple—the most common, obvious thing that we experience every day and every minute but that is so incredibly simple and natural that we have been passing it by without recognizing it for thousands of years
he was obviously not taken seriously, the others hardly even bothering to answer him, and this seemed to increase his irritability even further
he turned pale and leapt to his feet
i learned about it all the day before yesterday
for what is the purpose of this conversation between us?
i am the one who will decide!
i ought to have called you right away and set your mind at rest once and for all
i wanted to talk to you about
they all laughed aloud
seeing the door open now, foma and the two women were reluctant to go into the house, for, who knows what complications it might make later
and do you realize that you as good as put me on the same level as stebelkov in front of your friends?
i hope the soup is still hot
why have you come to pester me about that terrible man!
could you really have meant what you said?
anyway, you told me yourself that she was afraid of the letter you have
you’re an ispravnik and not mr napravnik
isn’t that what happened according to you?
we shall be happy, alyosha, don’t you think?
i felt unusually confident and full of energy as if nothing had happened the previous day
all the boys of my age i came across were my intellectual inferiors—yes, all of them, i ca not think of a single exception
and to give her my regards
i found all sorts of people kneeling and confessing aloud
they have no loyalty
it may look as if i have written all this to defend my mother's reputation, which may seem strange since, as i said before, i knew nothing whatsoever of her as she was then
well, let me assure you, i felt very healthy and pleased with life; morally, it gave me a great boost and it was a constant secret satisfaction to me
for if i had, this horrible thing would probably never have happened
i walked all the way home, but i remember nothing of that walk
the whole thing had a violent effect on lisa
his thoughts were splintered and scattered and he realized that he was afraid to bring all the fragments together to get a total picture of all the painful and conflicting feelings he had experienced in the course of that day
then you will see and hear him flinch and shudder in awe: how am i to endure this mercy?
i’d never dare try to make fun of you, sir, and, besides, i don’t at all feel like making fun of anyone, frightened as i am
at first, he wanted to complain to the school principal, but he finally decided not to allow bulkin to play with me anymore
don’t pay any attention, he’s nothing but an ordinary, petty devil
but i did manage to walk down the stairs without speeding up and, indeed, i believe i even slowed down my pace a little toward the end
i saw then that he understood
why are you so sad, mitya?
many of the townsfolk tried hard to get a glimpse of the painting, but maxim ordered the servants not to let anyone in
he asked him severely
in the world you can go far under false pretenses, but lies will never bring you back to the fold
oh, i am not as ardent as he is; i am calmer, but, like him, i want everybody to be good
a wonderful dream, the noble delusion of mankind!
almost ripping it off, he threw it down on the bench
you’d better wait a minute
i suffer, but i go on living
indeed, she supposedly rejected this scheme indignantly
so she would obviously be frightened of being left without anything and she would marry you
whatever happened to her was her own fault, he claimed with great assurance, and her seducer, he said, was none other than karp the wrench—a dangerous escaped convict, who at that time was living in hiding in our town
i have nothing to fear, smerdyakov said firmly
what did you mean by that?
you liar, you liar!
give him anything he asks for  or rather you know what i mean—vous comprenez, ma fille?
but today at last i realized it was simply temporary insanity
were they written by men?
what have i done to earn that distinction?
actually, as became obvious later, fetyukovich had never expected much from it
so it was a fact that mr dmitry had been there, i thought to myself, and i decided to go through with the whole business then and there, what with gregory lying there quite unconscious so he wouldn’t know anything even if he did live
he started by explaining that his first compromising outcries had referred to gregory, because he believed he was guilty of gregory’s death—that, i admit, i am responsible for
he must be saying it out of spite, because he’s angry with me
what fool have you been talking to all this time?
he described smerdyakov as a feeble-minded man with some rudiments of education, confused by certain philosophical ideas that were too much for his intelligence and frightened by some of the modern theories about the concept of duty and of one’s obligations, which he had had considerable opportunity to observe in his master—probably also his father—who openly led a highly irresponsible life
mother wept all the time and then, very gradually, so as not to alarm him, she started to beg my brother to fast and to take holy communion, for he was still on his feet
oh, andrei, could not we do something for her?
mother cried, throwing up her hands
yes, i agree, it was a difficult situation to bear and it could have turned the accused into a maniac
and now, suddenly, a lucky breakl there was no longer any need for whispered hints, tearful nagging, gossip, and innuendoes!
i was already tearing downstairs and, although she was still trying to catch up with me, i managed to reach the door, run downstairs, jump out into the street, and grab the first cab i saw
after graduating from high school, i immediately decided to break off completely with my family and, indeed, if the circumstances required it, with the entire world, although i was not even nineteen at the time
he was in his fifties, had an almost stern look about him, and was a man of few words
he explained to the children where to put the powder charge and where to roll in the shot
and there was blood all over him
he came in yesterday
i don’t remember which part of the country that song comes from but
i repeat, it’s just a legend and i tell it to you for what it’s worth
but we will not describe the train of his thoughts, especially as the time has not come yet for us to look into his soul—we shall do that in due course
the prosecutor and the examining magistrate exchanged significant glances
and he’ll be enormous!
and if you don’t help me, it will be the end of everything, and first of all the end of me, for i am at the end of my tether
it was as though what he had experienced that day had made him understand something of the utmost importance that would stay with him for the rest of his life, something that had been quite beyond him until then
it was all so unsubtle and obvious that, even in the state i was in, i could not possibly fail to be aware of it
yes, it was me
and i don’t want to see you again, except as a last resort
and that’s why he pretended to be jealous now
yet it was obvious that the old man had come to love his son deeply and sincerely; in fact, his feelings for alyosha were such as a man like him could never have expected to have for anyone
the pestle was in my hand
and when will that be?
but i did count on your
what a character he is!
as you well know, it's quite difficult to become acquainted with an englishman
alyosha learned with consternation that the elder was getting worse and worse
i realized that lambert was not in the room
all these people were his acquaintances and he felt just as he would have if they had all gathered on some social occasion the day before, before anything had happened
when questioned about smerdyakov, gregory crossed himself and said that he was an able fellow, but stupid and pestered by his sickness and, worst of all, he was a godless man, and it was mr karamazov and mr ivan who taught him his godlessness
but there is also a grief that bursts out, first in sobs, then in wailing—fits of wailing
once they have clawed at your heart, the scar will always be there
they’re on their way back from chermy and stopped here for the night
but what am i doing here!
when will it come about, if ever?
and even if i do love her, what of it?
is that what this creature, still only a little child, needs?
he became immersed in these thoughts, forgot his prayer, and finally gave it up altogether
good, alexei, my dear boy, from now on let’s treat people like hospital patients!
mitya’s heart came almost to a standstill—three thousand
don’t you feel ashamed to be sitting here with me?
just the day before it happened, vasin gave it to lisa  he wanted her to keep it for him
she will give you that money, lambert, because i, i do not want any of it
yes, he’s certainly not worth it
so let’s say you gulped down a glass and a half of pure alcohol—that’s not bad, is it?
whenever i realize, your reverence, that my joke isn’t succeeding, my cheeks begin to stick to my lower gums, like a sort of cramp
the moment she heard you coming she became hysterical!
somehow i suddenly felt terribly sorry for her
as long as a country is governed by a ruling caste, the nation is strong
all these details were a terrible shock to the impressionable lady and she kept shrieking and covering her eyes with her hands
the sight of an unworthy father inevitably arouses painful questions in a boy’s mind, especially if he compares his behavior with that of the worthy fathers of his contemporaries
indeed, some looked quite sad and despondent
there was something in katerina’s errand that aroused alyosha’s curiosity: when she had mentioned the captain’s young son who had run behind his humbled father crying, it had suddenly occurred to alyosha that it might be the same child who had later bitten his finger when alyosha was trying to find out how he could possibly have wronged him
i bet he just went to see my mother
miusov leaped up and rushed out of the room, followed by kalganov
that was how he greeted me, without even getting up
he is a happy man, although he has been condemned
ah, enough of all this nonsense!
alone, out of sight of anybody, deep in the woods  it smells of leaves
he tried to reduce his brother’s guilt by admitting to me that he himself disliked his father and that he, too, probably wished for his death
his gray eyes, although not very large, were lively and bold, and constantly sparkling with feeling
mitya was perplexed: of course, he would have to keep watch himself now, but he wasn’t sure where he should post himself—right here or at samsonov’s gate?
she is my light, the most sacred thing in my life!
what do i want here?
why, some of those things are not even mentionable, as you know
yes, he did, and i immediately accepted his challenge, but i decided to send him a letter first explaining my present feelings about what had happened and my deep regrets for the stupid mistake i had made
he said with a poisonous smile
he didn’t make a sound
a merchant lived there by the name of maxim skotoboinikov and there was no one richer than him in the whole district
why, the new doctor said you’d get better
on a foul, damp, foggy petersburg morning, it seems to me that the imaginary world of someone like pushkin's herman from the queen of spades (a colossal, extraordinary, and true petersburg type) must take an even tighter hold of him
he was longing to get up and announce that he would not tell them another word, even if they lead me off to be executed
he did go to see smerdyakov twice
no, i do not mean deceptively, i mean
i also knew that poverty represented no more than a small share of his misfortunes, a tenth or perhaps only a twentieth of them
then, in their pride, even these two would be unable to restrain each other and the last man would destroy the last but one, and then kill himself
the marquis cried in despair
these past few days, with the bright spring sun shining high in the sky, have kept reminding me of that other sunny morning last fall when lisa and i were walking down the street, full of joy, of hope, and of love for one another
oh, please, don’t be afraid of me—this is my very last night!
now, of course, i know how intelligent you are, but at first i decided you were rather simple
people saw the boy run down to the water, to the jetty where the ferry was tied, stretch his arms toward the water, and then stop dead, terrified
then they proceeded to call them back, one at a time
he was bordering on despair, something that had never happened to him before
she cried, and began to roll the cannon up and down on her knee
why, since smerdyakov knew these signals too, and inasmuch as you categorically deny having anything to do with the death of your father, couldn’t it have been smerdyakov who tapped out the agreed signal and, when your father opened the door, perpetrated the crime?
lisa lowered her eyes
strangely enough, though, both the prosecutor and the examining magistrate now listened to him with apparent indifference, looking at him very coldly and hardly asking him any questions
mankind is today on the eve of its regeneration, which, in fact, has already started
you see, it’s quite possible, if i’m still alive or am resurrected on the day the mother embraces her child’s murderer, that i may join them all in their praises and shout with them, you were right’; but as of now, i do not want to join them
oh, he felt insulted by the fact that he owed me the three thousand, because it made him realize how contemptible he was himself!
alyosha saw the crack and thought that lise might be watching him from her wheel-chair, but he himself could not see her
are we not allowed to love our country?
we managed to pay one month's rent in advance, but it was hard to stay alive
and yet some vague, painful, evil residue from his conversation with ivan kept stirring deep within him, striving to come to the surface
but this time i decided to go
and it is then that the sign of the son of man will appear in the heavens
do you call that a man?
have you seen prince sergei sokolsky and darzan, gentlemen?
for in the two of you, his truth will have been fulfilled
it's no mere idea—it's a passion
above all, he had a sound idea of how much he could get away with and when it was time to stop; in his relations with the school authorities, he never went beyond a certain limit, after which an infraction of discipline would be considered disorder, rebellion, and lawlessness, and no longer tolerated
that song is already out of date, he said aloud
oh, i know, this is quite a reckless thing to do when it comes to his own interests, but it's such an elegant, such a dazzling act!
and it was at this juncture that the accused, trying desperately to mend his fences, hurriedly told us about that little bag around his neck, as if to say: all right, then, if that’s how it is, i’ll have to tell you the whole truth now!
then he took his riding crop and started lashing at her bare shoulders
that's not true either
if that were the case, he’d never have mentioned the secret to you, would he?
as for me, i’ve never read the lives of the saints, nor do i intend to
of course, i will try to be helpful in a crisis, that is, if i can find out what to do
nastya interrupted him, hurriedly discarding and completely forgetting her original hypothesis
so why are you looking for trouble?
are you calling me a puppy!
and ever since i can remember myself, there was always you, watching over me with kindness and love
as he said this, alyosha felt that he had turned very red and was furious with himself for having yielded to dmitry’s insistent demand that he say what he thought of katerina, and for being forced to give such stupid answers
but it didn’t last
by the time we graduated from the school and received our officers’ commissions, we were prepared, at a moment’s notice, to shed our blood for the honor of our regiment, although hardly one of us had any idea of the true meaning of the word honor, and if any of us had known, he would have been the first to ridicule it
love ivan, he heard mitya’s voice ringing in his ears
and mitya sat down on the bench next to the drunk to bide his time, as he had put it
later, people in town were to say that it was really amazing that all these people should have been gathered by sheer chance in the police inspector’s house on the night of the crime
i repeat, it was very hard for me to follow all the developments in order, and, even today, the whole scene is still very confused in my mind
he had felt he had to give expression to his feelings, and he had addressed himself to rakitin
nevertheless, allow me to have my say, for it is possible that you may remember some of my words
you’re so slow, mother
i’m sure of it
the defense counsel exclaims and, without blinking an eye, goes on to conclude that christ teaches us to mete out to others as others mete out to us, and he does so from what he himself describes as a platform for justice and for sane, healthy ideas!
but, good god, here i’m keeping you out in this cold and you have no overcoat on!
oh, he's a generous man and, first of all, he will restore peace to your mother's heart because, to him, she's the dearest creature on earth
this form of disavowal of your own words sounds too much like a reiteration of them, the baron growled, and i consider what you say definitely disrespectful
did i see a look of understanding in your eye, arkady?
i can’t even describe it properly
you are not really angry with me, are you?
as to the practical aspect, this plan was very much the same as the previous one; that is, he would offer as a guarantee to transfer his rights to chermashnya to her, but, of course, he would not bring in the incentive of profit he had tried to use with samsonov the day before, for she certainly would not be interested in the possibility of getting back six or even seven thousand rubles for the three she would lend him; no, with her, chermashnya would simply be a gentleman’s security for his debt
and she really believed it
everyone in town was greatly moved, all of philanthropic and pious geneva was tremendously excited
under us they will all be happy and they will not rise in rebellion and kill one another all the world over, as they are doing now with the freedom you gave them
she listened intently: the groans came again
to which his blessing he would give
the old man said, staring at alyosha
how can anyone ask for a requiem mass for someone who is still alive, and you, his mother of all people!
i had an idea now of what interested me most in this horrible mess
they turn into the second street, oh!
i was afraid to go there because even back in moscow those people frightened me
so go and congratulate her for me
he shouted at me indignantly, probably deciding i was some sort of fool
the same was true of some of the decisions i made then: although i was perfectly lucid when i made them, it did not bother me in the least if there was no logic whatsoever in them
we are asked to believe that this violent but weak man, a man who could not resist the temptation of accepting so dishonorably that three thousand rubles, would suddenly become so stoical as to carry fifteen hundred rubles around his neck without allowing himself to touch it!
i saw devils hiding under the cassocks of some of those monks, close to their bosoms, with just their horns showing
do you really sincerely believe that?
i had invented him myself and now the real man could not possibly match that imaginary being
but this stern young woman never yielded to him completely, despite his unrestrained physical passion, so typical of a karamazov, and despite the fact that she was very much under his spell
ah yes, as i was telling you, that doctor, he came in connection with this temporary insanity business
but how can she be so sure that i will stay there?
noticing right away that they were unwashed and that their shirts were dirty, she turned on gregory and slapped his face too
november days are short, and so it was already rather dark when alyosha rang at the prison gate
it never occurred to me that i would have to apologize merely for having come in his company and
why couldn’t there be among them one martyr, a man filled with great sadness and love for his fellow men?
i think that would be best, although we do need money
then suddenly he jumped back and stood erect, facing alyosha, his whole figure striving to express his unquenchable pride
mitya cried in surprise
mitya suddenly burst into sobs and seized alyosha by the hand
and that was the three thousand rubles that i had in my pocket when i got to grushenka’s and it was that money that i spent in mokroye
as to this fellow, i will settle with him myself
that america, god damn it, i hate it already!
he just gave kolya another intent look
i think you have an exaggerated opinion of me
and so the obligation to accomplish something real, such as making at least one live person happy, would bring him back to his senses and reset him on his proper course
i don’t see why what i say should affect you, mr miusov
but alyosha suddenly realized that rakitin was looking at him mockingly and he stopped short
and i was terribly worried about mother
in that case, you could perhaps clear something up for me, since you have so much more experience than i now, suppose a lady who is just saying good-by to you suddenly says: 'i will be at such and such a place tomorrow at three
i’ve had enough of this
do me this favor, alexei, i beseech you
then nelyudov, in the presence of the witnesses, ran his fingers along the lapels, the cuffs, and all the seams of the jacket and trousers, as though looking for something—money, of course
now i’ve forgotten what i was going to say
it’s impossible to decide before the verdict is known
that was the topic he chose as soon as i arrived that morning
on that estate, beside makar there was also a girl, and she was already about eighteen when makar, who was fifty, suddenly announced his intention of marrying her
suddenly, and i can still see the way he looked at that moment, half smiling, he got up, hugged me hard, and kissed me
but now let us get down to business, gentlemen
i have no comment and when you read it you will know what it's about
this is no blasphemy, alyosha, i assure you!
i’ll even swear to it!
later, however, specialists told me that it was not a sham at all, that it was a terrible female disease, particularly widespread in russia (which shows what a hard life russian peasant women have), a sickness resulting from exhausting work following too soon upon a difficult, abnormal labor without medical help, and from an intensely unhappy life, full of brutality and ill-treatment, which, although common enough, is beyond the powers of endurance of some women
here, perezvon, lie down!
mitry here will be going
and he even imagined that i was capable of accepting his money in payment for your disgrace!
ah, papa, papa, papa dear’
and yet, even now, as i write this, i still do not know what to call that feeling
and he, he had never even given him a serious thought!
they brought grushenka in
i found a second right away—a lieutenant from my regiment
but the most delighted of all was mrs snegirev; she kept giggling and snapping her fingers and shouting:
no, i don’t, alyosha said
he did not choose to be a slave to his passion
but i think i know now, why
oh, unlike hamlet, they do not worry about the dread of something after death,  as if the entire preoccupation with the soul and what will happen to it after death had long since been erased from their minds and covered over with sand
entering the garden, even before he caught sight of you running away from the window through which you’d seen your father—according to your own testimony—he glanced to his left and saw that, indeed, the window was open just as you said
perhaps she would just returned home from somewhere?
and her you certainly have no right to judge
besides, he loves mother, i saw how he embraced her
ah, it is all still in the planning stage, i see
it was soon after my arrival from moscow and i would gone there on an errand for my mother
in other words, i’m willing to work if i’m paid for it
i say he's an animal, not a man
i myself think my question was pretty unimportant, kolya said with a conqueror’s modesty
well, whatever it is, vodka or salami, this is great and we mustn’t let the opportunity slip!
he was still relatively young, about thirty-five, apparently had a predisposition to consumption, and was married to a very big, childless woman
the forged shares have been in circulation for some time now and more of them will be put on the market, even though some have already been recognized as forgeries
besides, you’ll never get there in time—the bells are ringing for late mass
i will win some money and pay him back today, i thought desperately
i certainly won’t tell him anything of the sort, alyosha said, smiling
he abused the sacrament of confession, came the accusing angry whispers of the most hardened opponents of the institution of elders, who counted among them some of the oldest monks, the strictest in their devotions, great fasters, famed for their long periods of silence, some of whom, indeed, had not spoken since long before father zosima’s death and who had now suddenly unsealed their lips
i am late with his quinine and now his temperature's up!
you must really be out of your mind, prosecutor, if you think i could have gone through with that!
but that shouldn’t prevent us, the clever people, from sitting in a warm house and putting brandy to good use
my mother worked hard and my sister too took in sewing
why do you look at me like that?
the room grew completely quiet
but until that day we must keep hope alive, and now and then a man must set an example, if only an isolated one, by trying to lift his soul out of its isolation and offering it up in an act of brotherly communion, even if he is taken for one of god’s fools
oh, i wish to god this disgraceful moment could be obliterated from my past
what you need is a whipping, a good whipping on your backside!
what about the message you’re supposed to be waiting for from mokroye?
finally mrs khokhlakov ran out
and, anyway, you know enough for now
and now he told me that he would stolen the money that very morning out of his mother's strong box, which he would opened with a copy of the key he would had made
there’s more to it: i know that at least five days ago he drew three thousand rubles out of the bank in hundred-ruble bills, put them in a large envelope, sealed it with five seals, and tied it up with a red ribbon
did you know that?
but something seemed to have happened to smerdyakov
yesterday, in answer to katerina's letter, he made her a formal proposal of marriage
my head was spinning
mrs prutkov fell silent
well, that's just how i took much of what he said
probably he would intended to shoot her first and then shoot himself, but since we would interfered with his original plan, he would pointed the gun at his heart
mr karamazov said challengingly
well, the sick man suddenly regained his senses, heard the shouting, went out, and what?
now that’s really an improper thing to say, father joseph, the monastery’s librarian, remarked
the jurists, however, were not interested in the moral aspects of the case and viewed the whole business from the point of view of the legal technicalities involved as a result of the recent judicial reforms
and we are great too!
can you forgive me—can you?
this made mother very sad and was considered in the house as a great sacrifice on his part, which the collection of admiring females around him described as heroic
wait, lambert, it's me who's firing you and i may even decide to wring your neck!
there have been only two people who talked to me with complete seriousness before: my late husband, who was an extremely intelligent and
she too remained silent for a whole minute
do you think it would be possible for me to become better acquainted with her?
maxim gave all his land and all he owned to his wife, handed her all his money and titles; he did everything in proper legal form
i’ve come to understand my illness unerringly now
i was holding the money in my hand
she was waiting for her message at the time and, as mitya had not come over either that day or the day before, she was hoping that with luck he might not come at all before she left
so why must we go anywhere?
she stopped for a second, looking forlorn, her eyes on mitya
the words katerina had spoken in alyosha’s presence rang in his ears—that it was he, ivan, and he alone who had convinced her that mitya was the murderer
but, alas, he grew so slowly!
all right, never mind; if you like it, why should not you appreciate it just like any other bon mot?
a woman stands for vice and seduction and a man for generosity and magnanimity
it was because of that letter that kraft invited me to his place after we left those people
i never had a friend until now, and i used to consider the notion of friendship sheer nonsense
and it will be weighed down by remorse and by the debt he will feel, from now on, he owes his fellow men
oh, if you only knew what’s going on between the two of them at this very moment—it’s heartbreaking, a terrible story, something unbelievable: they’re both throwing away their lives for no good reason; they are both perfectly aware of it and actually enjoying it
he was very busy and appeared to be in a great hurry, but he heard and turned his head toward me
so as soon as i got home i would burn it over a candle, yes, absolutely over a candle
grushenka had become strangely thoughtful and there was suddenly a suggestion of cruelty in the curve of her lip
you never listened to me talk until yesterday when you noticed me using a phrase that was not to your liking
oh, it's only that you use such awfully funny phrases
all right then, i said, slipping the letter into my pocket
i will remember your sorrow too and i will also pray for your husband, that the lord may grant him health and happiness
the baron suddenly leaped to his feet
she shouted, or you’ll get a taste of my stick!
if i must love my fellow man, he had better hide himself, for no sooner do i see his face than there’s an end to my love for him
the elder sat down on a leather-covered mahogany sofa of antique design, while inviting his four visitors to sit on four mahogany chairs covered with badly worn black leather ranged along the opposite wall
perkhotin was very surprised
the visitor sat there and waited, just as a parasite house guest does when he comes down from his room for tea but, seeing his host frowning and apparently preoccupied with something, waits patiently until he is addressed, always ready to start a pleasant tea-table conversation
he could not speak anymore; he was gasping for breath
que diable, i am stupid often enough without being high-minded!
well, this one is really frightening, terribly cunning
his eyes were darting back and forth from the examining magistrate to the prosecutor
so, instead of going on, i just laughed
i know you saw her, but i know too that you did not dare talk to her
an evil spark appeared in smerdyakov’s eyes and the left one began to twitch
katerina’s beauty struck alyosha again, as it had three weeks or so before, when dmitry had brought him to introduce him to her, on her insistence that she wanted to meet his youngest brother
what a handshake—you almost broke my fingers!
alexei darzan, ippolit nashchokin, sergei hastily introduced them
you mean he bit your finger, snegirev said, jumping up from his chair, your finger, sir?
come, act like a decent man, dmitry, do you hear me?
but smerdyakov asked me not to repeat what he’d told me to dmitry, alyosha added
lean over—i want to whisper something in your ear
he yelled at the top of his voice
why, of course, it is not very easy to understand
we let our lads do the flogging
and i would have a fire going
somehow i only now fully grasped what he was driving at and i began to shiver all over
still, up to the very last moment he did not change
why, the one where you were yesterday
but when it comes to inner feelings, that’s quite a different matter, gentlemen, mitya said frowning, and i don’t really think you have the right to ask me about my feelings
he went in and did what he had come to do
but when i listened, i noticed he was talking about what he called a babe
the little peasant argued, begging them to wait for akim
but whatever it is, a pipe dream or not, i want to be allowed to die with that pipe dream
ask me about facts and i will answer everything to your satisfaction
it’s all nonsense really, maximov answered with obvious pleasure, although pretending to be a little coy
and, although certain impressions stood out, there were too many of them for any one to stand out and give meaning to the whole picture
i embraced mother tenderly and a( once inquired about versilov
believe me, i would be only too glad to do anything i can
since they had already once before planned to certify him as insane, now they had even better reasons to do so, if only to prevent his marriage
please, we would appreciate it very much, the examining magistrate said
too much had already happened, and it weighed upon him
some of the ladies, especially the out-of-towners, appeared in the gallery in the most sumptuous attire, but most of the women gave no thought to elegance
i am very well aware that i behave in a reprehensible way, that i gamble, scatter money to the winds, that perhaps i am even a thief
now, karamazov’s youngest son, alexei, had been living among us for the past year and we had met him before his brothers
ah, hell, after almost half a year, i’ve suddenly managed to throw it off!
nevertheless we went downstairs but then, as i was about to climb into the carriage, i said to him: wait for me a minute
alyosha entered the house, giving his name to the parlormaid who had opened the door for him
on the contrary, i have only your own interest at heart and wish you good in every way
how did you turn that way?
i would taken the plunge and started talking
what did he tell you?
have you forgotten that peace, and even death, is more attractive to man than the freedom of choice that derives from the knowledge of good and evil?
it was not to get money from her
come on, do not be silly
i also have a certain opinion of him that i must first check out
and you too, ivan, my respectful son, hear that i command thee to follow me from this place!
the girl who stood by the window suddenly cried out, looking at her father with scorn and distaste
and, thank god, when i myself conceived my idea, it was certainly not the worship of the golden calf, for it was obviously not really money that i was after!
i lay unconscious for nine days in all
i lied, ignoring conscience and honor, trying to save him at any cost, because he hated and despised me!
the walls were covered with bright blue wallpaper full of cracks, in which cockroaches swarmed in such amazing numbers that there was a continuous rustling
and they are also a bunch of drunkards: as soon as you pay one of them, off he goes to a tavern and he will stay there until he has drunk all his money and his clothes too and there's not a stitch left on him and he will come out completely naked
well, as i said before, it is awfully difficult to express oneself in bussian: here i have filled three whole pages about resenting my name all my life and now the reader will probably conclude that what i really resent is not being prince dolgoruky but just plain dolgoruky
you know what, he said, it’s all nonsense really, a meaningless poem by a scatter-brained student who’s never written two lines of poetry in his life
and then the hope of getting the three thousand was gone, for he knew his father would never give it to him after the beating
nevertheless, another silence followed
i cannot answer these questions, disturbing though they are
but he didn’t see the open door when he regained consciousness after being wounded, but before he was struck; he saw it just after he came out of the cottage
get the hell out of here with your stupid big words and grand gestures!
what his sickness was i still cannot explain very well; some claimed that it was his heart, but then it was announced that, on his wife’s insistence, a group of doctors had examined him and had discovered early symptoms of mental disorder
ah yes, 'one ca not take offense with everybody,  yes, that's it!
grushenka could not finish saying what she would do; she covered her face with a handkerchief and burst into sobs
the man kept starting a song, interrupting himself, swearing, and starting again in a hoarse, drunken voice:
although i decided not to describe anything unless it had a direct bearing on my story, i will nevertheless remark that the black coffin, which was already there, was not at all a plain one despite its color—it was upholstered with velvet—and also that the pall was of a sumptuousness not at all in keeping with the convictions or the character of the deceased
i have come now to sweep them out with a broom
he had not heard about it and asked me for more details, mainly about the time and place that the marriage had been settled
even the last time smerdyakov had not spoken to ivan in that tone
and that's what i have been thinking all this time and that's why i based such hopes on you
mother, mother, darling, stop, please stop!
i have come to find out how you are, i said, going straight up to makar
and then, quite unexpectedly, she added: but i was under the impression that you would been seeing the old prince almost every day
what made up for it was only my instinct, which told me that lisa was unhappy and that mother was unhappy too
everything else in my life became subordinated to it
if i had known, i would never have said all those things
only superior and happy natures can radiate communicative gaiety, that is, be irresistibly and cheerfully gay
the colonel went dashing over to trifonov’s, but the merchant cut him off: i never received any money from you, nor could you possibly have given me any
well, your sincere joy at once recaptured  amy youthful heart
i was on the verge of fainting
it was soon after this had occurred to him that he met alyosha in the street
what strikes me now as i try to remember how he described it all to me is that he never used the word love, never spoke of falling in love
mitya cried, throwing up his hands
the tears were running down my cheeks as i wrote to her
and just at that second they came abreast of each other and the man, swaying from side to side, butted right into ivan
people weigh on me, make me feel uneasy, and uneasiness would have prevented me from achieving my goal
finally, unable to contain himself any longer, he bent toward his neighbor’s ear and said in an undertone, taunting him:
he said, suddenly getting up, as if remembering something very important
you know where we really ought to go now, alyosha?
certain invisible ties must be established between the defender and the jurors during the defender’s speech
i want you to come back, ivan, do you hear!
yes, i did pawn my pistols to him for ten rubles, and so what?
i have other things on my mind
i mentioned tatyana just now, but that doesn’t mean that i’m for the emancipation of women
as to what happened, it was simply caused by your excessive fondness for abstract discussion
laid low by his epileptic seizure, smerdyakov was lying immobile in his little room
do you know why i’m telling you all this, alyosha?
this is how it goes
that one—i saw him yesterday, but i couldn’t find him today
what does it actually mean to qualify through suffering to sit in judgment of others?
that's what i wanted to ask you
and now miss anna and mrs akhmakov drive over to visit him every other day
but i thought i was being stupid
but later versilov had it brought to russia and i believe it may even be in petersburg now
he looked as if he was very irritable, as if he was always in too much of a hurry
i would even ask you if i could to
they all, except the elder, rose nervously from their seats
i don’t know in what field
when the young versilov was gone, i pounced upon the woman:
and we are no gods
they have science, but science contains nothing that does not come through the senses
it was already getting light outside
and you, alyosha, do you really want to leave?
then i threw it down over here
i’ll be your slave now, your slave as long as i live, and i’ll love being your slave
lambert had at first convinced him to come in on the deal with him and, after he had got hold of the document, he would told him about every circumstance and every detail of the operation, including the final stratagem introduced by versilov to get mrs prutkov out of the way
there’s no way out now
ilya himself, his employers, and various kind-hearted townspeople, mostly local merchants, often tried to make lizaveta dress more decently
he was like a man in a delirium, a man not responsible for his actions
for one thing, if i accepted now, you would be coming and pestering me every day until the time for the appeal had passed
then he sees her off to her protector’s house, for, strangely enough, he is not jealous of samsonov—a very characteristic psychological feature of his affair
anyway, you often say one thing one day and just the opposite the next
ivan’s unexpected action, and his dialogue with the elder, puzzled everyone in the room, and they were all struck by his almost solemn air
have you brought your mattress with you, hee-hee-hee?
i know you’ve met her
so i was reciting the fable to you and you were listening smilingly, but before i was halfway through, you stopped me, rang for the servant, and told him to ask mrs prutkov to come to your study
why did i stay and bear it all as if i would accepted to bear a cross, as if i were ready to perform a feat of heroism?
the unhappy young man went home and shot himself that very night
perhaps the money is still there
why did you give me money?
and, indeed, he beamed with pleasure
listen, alyosha, i was rude to your elder
no, smerdyakov’s faith isn’t russian, alyosha answered quietly and firmly
he looked at me with complete openness and sincerity and also with infinite warmth
i feel completely crushed!
what can i do for you?
he gave one to perkhotin and handed the other to misha
now alyosha was almost sure that it must be the same boy, although he did not know why he was so sure
please do not be offended by what happened last night
love is gone, mitya, she began again, but what is gone is so dear to me that it hurts
you must know mrs salomeyev
he laughed, but later he wept too
he was devouring her with his eyes
they were gay, pretty girls who had recently completed their education, and although it was common knowledge in town that they would have no dowries, their grandfather’s house still attracted the young men of our society
ah, you virgin boy!
i’m sure you know exactly what the penalty is
you, arkady, being a young man of this generation, you are probably something of a socialist and i am sure you do not like the idea that idleness is appreciated the most among the toiling masses
he looked approvingly at andreyev
katerina suddenly cried out, her lips beginning to quiver
cher enfant, i heard that you were ill
i’ll teach him to laugh at me
and perhaps it was because all those ideas were raging within me without my even being aware of their existence that i drank, behaved wildly, and beat people up; without knowing it, i was trying to drown out and silence those doubts
even as i would left her, she had still been looking at me with amazement
with uncalled for brusqueness, he told mitya to get into one of the carts
have you just come from my father's?
and, if you remember, we were told all this in a tone that brooked no dissent
ivan cried with a sort of childish glee, as though he had just remembered something that he had been trying hard to recall
it's so strange, i ca not believe it, i ca not believe it
alyosha said, smiling again
it was pretty clear, wasn’t it?
i would guess you were plotting to force me to marry you or something of that sort and you worked out a whole scheme with some accomplice, an old classmate of yours perhaps
and now, on top of all this commotion, you have to come along and worry me with that letter
but do not be tempted and do not try to use this ignorance as an excuse for yourself, for the eternal judge will only call you to account for what you can understand, not for what you cannot, and by then you will see everything in the true light and you will not protest
the little goose says quack-quack-quack,
mrs khokhlakov had not been feeling well for the past three weeks: her foot had somehow become swollen and, although she was not actually in bed, she had to stay home, reclining in a very attractive, albeit most decorous, déshabillé on the sofa in her boudoir
let me tell you of another instance that occurred only a few days ago
i had to take her to the monastery that day and have the holy fathers lecture her on meekness and calm her down
i was thinking of mother and how i had not spoken to her just now
although a widower, the inspector led the life of a family man; his house was run by his widowed daughter, herself the mother of two grown-up daughters, makarov’s granddaughters
is that the way to unite them?
i am sure you understand
there was a hint of cruelty in her slightly twisted smile
but i was driven by an uncontrolled curiosity, a strange fear, and some other feeling that i cannot define
kolya was standing by ilyusha’s bed
you know, when i told him that i refused to remain silent, he tried to switch the conversation to geological upheavals and all that sort of nonsense!
i will deal with these questions later because my primary concern now is to discuss the possibility of attaining my objective
if you were not my son, i’d challenge you to a duel this very second—pistols
he sat down again, looking around him now and then as if expecting to find something
besides, your answer was bound to reflect your democratic position
alyosha soon emerged from the house and went quickly up to kolya
this was all perfectly true
the main topic of our conversation was the socialist revolutionaries who, incidentally, were at that time being persecuted
the boys picked up the coffin, and when they lowered it beside nina, she kissed her brother’s lips for the last time
mitya muttered, somewhat put off by the admonition
you made me recite the fussy maid all over again and this time i got all the way to the end and finished with a flourish that made even mrs prutkov smile at me while you yourself went as far as to shout 'bravo, bravo!
he was not distrustful, however, or shy and unsociable, just the opposite, in fact
sincere laughter free of malice denotes gaiety, and how many people are there who know how to be gay in this century of ours?
and on top of that, he must have fully understood now how shabbily he had behaved toward lisa, and all to no avail
but you must admit it's not fair—you bought it for two and sold it for ten
you were talking about some  wouldepressing connections'
perhaps it contained pepper as well?
you agree too, don’t you?
i want to know the truth
but that is the reasoning of another world and it’s incomprehensible to the human heart here on earth
but there was a bright and glittering spot in the center of my field of vision that prevented me from focusing on many things that passed right before my eyes: i lightheartedly refused to take in anything that was gloomy and threatening, being interested only in that bright spot
they start with the most ridiculously trivial things, but in the end they conquer their will and thus gain their freedom
she knit her brows and her face reddened darkly
i am so glad you did come in the end!
and tell them to prepare champagne for him, three dozen bottles, say, and have them pack it just the way they did the time i went to mokroye
oh, good lord, alexei, i’m getting all mixed up
and now he still needs a hat
of course, of course, but those are just commonplaces
just the fact that he keeps company with you says enough!
we have corrected your work and have now founded it on miracle, mystery, and authority
yes, i’m sure it’s his doing, mitya said, frowning
the latter two had also appeared as ordinary witnesses for the prosecution
and she no longer loves dmitry
still, at certain quiet moments, he would think about his soul, sigh, and worry a great deal about life beyond the grave
soon they let him into the room and i sat down on vasin's sofa to try to eavesdrop, but i could not make out what they were saying, except that versilov's name kept coming up again and again
he was in the garden,  we are told, hence he is the murderer
a tramp in the best sense
i have money too and my money is better than his
ivan shouted, staring into the bailiff’s face, and all of a sudden he seized the man by the shoulders and, full of rage, hurled him to the floor
i am so glad you came, kraft said
katerina seemed very pleased to see alyosha
this is what i have come here for, to throw myself at your feet and ask you
but then something very annoying and unpleasant happened in the house, making mr karamazov terribly anxious and distraught
true wit is becoming extinct, it's becoming rarer and rarer
but kolya himself was anxious to keep his distance from the teacher; he always did his homework well, was second in his class, and treated dardanelov coldly; many boys were still convinced that he was good enough in world history to show up dardanelov himself
so who do you think is the murderer?
the arresting police officer was accusing me of assaulting a colonel
i have described all this in the hope that you would notice a fact that i consider extremely revealing
may turn out to be quite unfounded
i take my hat off to him!
first, we have before us a poor little boy, abandoned in the backyard, without shoes, as we were told by a shocked witness, a highly esteemed townsman of ours, a man, alas, of foreign extraction
well, let the son face his father and ask him: tell me, why should i love you?
but dmitry lived far away and very likely was not even at home now
for, indeed, they have been prepared in their quiet retreat for an hour and a day, a month and a year
samsonov was a sick man and during the past year he had lost the use of his swollen legs
indeed, he has already wasted a good thousand rubles on the beauty, and that’s why he keeps borrowing money
still, he greeted me warmly, but when i started asking him questions he answered with obvious reluctance and also seemed to find it difficult to keep his mind on what he was saying
three fresh horses were being led through the open gates
besides, it will be your birthday
but all these thoughts just flashed through my mind because there was something real that was making my heart pound, something that i could not define
ah, le petit vilain!
it was true, of course, that i had been worrying about that letter and had felt the need for an impartial opinion, but i admit that i already felt i could cope with the dilemma without any outside help
rakitin had so worked himself up that he could hardly control himself
and in the name of what did she do it?
i am outraged by you, holy fathers!
i turned the key and suddenly there was the blackness of the night stretching in front of me, boundless, dangerous, and unknown
before going any deeper into my petersburg story with all the events in which i am to play a disgraceful part, i consider this preliminary explanation quite indispensable
but ivan is silent as the grave
i expected he’d kill old mr karamazov
it was settled without you, for how could old mitya karamazov turn down an offer to escape?
she suddenly leaned toward me and lowered her voice as if the answer to that question had been the main object of her visit
they’ll have smoked salmon too, the expert on troy put in unexpectedly in a loud voice
i understand your whole class visits him now?
indeed, i was glad whenever i could distract him and cheer him up
so i took the prescription and put it on the shelf where the icons are and just left it lying there
i’m leaving you with a clear conscience
and that's why they all joked and laughed that day
that’s what the prosecutor was referring to, i know, because i heard him talking about it last week
no, i suppose that's impossible
i still ca not make out to this day exactly what sort of man he is
you know, i do not at all understand why your sister should love me, but i can tell you that, if it had not been for her, i probably would not even be alive today
he spoke resolutely with an overtone of impatience, which he apparently did not try to conceal—indeed, perhaps he wanted the others to understand that he didn’t really mean what he was saying and was being derisive
smurov said, stopping suddenly
[] a single line, but a classic!
a lofty ideal is mostly a feeling that sometimes remains undefined for a very, very long time
lately i would been to see anna rather often
some doctor over there in america will graft a wart or something onto my face, for they’re great technicians, those americans, after all
his wild yell resounded from the street
i believe it was because at that point we both felt there were many things we should explain to each other
well,  i say to her, that depends on people’s taste and, as to you,  i say, you aren’t big, but you stink
but i must be on my way
(alyosha later remembered himself that on that terrible day he forgot completely about his brother dmitry, although earlier he had been so worried about him; he also forgot to take the two hundred rubles back to ilyusha’s father, although he had been so anxious to do so the day before)
besides, the word contemporary’ would have reminded saltykov-shchedrin of his magazine the contemporary, a rather painful reminder in view of the difficulties they are having with our present censors
i must emphasize here that this was the very first meeting of the karamazovs, the first time that some members of that strange family had set eyes on each other
there is nothing hidden that shall not become manifest
suddenly ivan began to laugh and stood up, hat in hand
he’s very sick too, lise
and, besides, that way you have not had to suffer the humiliation of rejection
i would made up my mind and i went directly to see mrs prutkov
everything will pass and the truth alone will remain
but he had hardly uttered the words before mitya was on top of him
she had obviously enjoyed the story and versilov's way of telling it, although she would kept darting worried looks at lisa
kolya suddenly straightened up and faced alyosha, as though ready to fight him
as long as this notion is kept alive in a few minds, there's still hope for its realization: it's like a bright spot glowing in the dark
as god is my witness, i trust you implicitly where lise is concerned and i don’t even mind that she asked you to come in secret from her mother
it was the person who opened the door to the house who killed and robbed my father!
you’re quite a business woman yourself, he told her, giving her eight thousand rubles or so, so why don’t you operate with it on your own
that time, however, it never got him anywhere
and on top of that,  she told me, if you sue him, i won’t have anything to do with you and you’ll never earn one kopek from me, and my merchant will kick you out
that’s where all the boys leave their coats; otherwise it gets too cluttered in the room
there was cold contempt and a note of anger in his voice
i don’t know why
even before anything 'sinful' had taken place, i explained the situation to makar with the most extraordinary bluntness
she gave her an address, somewhere near the voznesensky bridge—the street, the house, the number of the apartment—and left
that’s the way it always is with god’s fools: they’re liable to cross themselves at the sight of a tavern and then hurl stones at a church
once he had decided, alyosha would have félt it strange, even impossible, to go on living as he had been
it would seem that a man with a powerful constitution like his should have been able to weather a night of drinking, even one full of violent emotions
but i must say i didn’t anticipate anything of this sort, although i knew the man with whom i came here
that mr napravnik i was referring to is one of the greatest russian conductors, and it’s a sort of conductor that we need for the harmony of our little enterprise
this last remark slipped from my lips inadvertently as i stared at his shining eyes and his face, which had grown even paler
alyosha’s great merit in this matter lay precisely in the way he had succeeded in tactfully reconciling each boy in turn with ilyusha, as though by chance, and without any slobbery sentimentality
but i’ll leave this town soon enough and may be gone for a very long time
do not you recognize it?
i inquired to get some idea
come back soon, very soon
miusov, however, did not find it necessary to answer father paisii’s pressing and almost angry question
i am sure they are aware of it, but they wo not let on and continue to forge ahead queen-like, without turning their heads
much as i may want to, i can do nothing about it
and, mind you, there are no exceptions
mitya shouted in despair
that's her, all right
just that: whether you wanted your father murdered or not
ivan gave him a long, long look
he also wanted me to tell you something else, alyosha said, his voice quivering
how can you say things like that?
ivan stared at him and suddenly began to shake in convulsive terror
nevertheless i sat and waited
it was because of her that he made that disgraceful scene in the elder’s cell—just because miusov referred to her as a creature’ or something
in my opinion, christ’s love for human beings was an impossible miracle on earth
did he seem sincere or was he putting on an act?
i gave him my word and i must keep it
if he had said one word then, perhaps i would have pulled myself together, although perhaps not
that night i hated her: first with a raving madman's hatred, then with that of a disgusting sensuous drunkard
but since he was in town, she had asked him to examine ilyusha as well and had notified snegirev in advance
you look at me so gently, and you do not even consider me worthy of your anger?
he impressed general akhmakov greatly
and this time she has put her full trust in him in the hope of getting rid of him once and for all
was it a real epileptic fit or were you shamming it?
at that moment my sister came in and i turned to her at once
who are you going to complain to?
he laughed and said, yes, it’s very good,  and left
or perhaps i would better just get out of this dump
nor has he ever said a word about marrying mother
he stared at kolya
the old woman uncorked it without cooling it
well, if that’s how it is, i won’t drink either, grushenka said
his name is karamazov, mother, the captain corrected her
or do you imagine that there’s some kind of deal between us and that i’m afraid you may talk?
don’t worry, we’ll do something about that
and so, as long as i was in her presence, i did not dare to contradict her
he asked in a loud voice
as if you really believed that!
what will i do with my wife and my family?
i’ll save you just as i saved my cousin belmesov
on holy thursday, we have something cooked without oil and drink wine with some dry food, because the laodicean council says of holy thursday: it is wrong to break your fast on the thursday of the last week of lent and thus dishonor the whole of lent
the landlord paused and looked at us each in turn with delight
she's got hold of you to find out certain things from you, lisa told me in angry whispers with an expression such as i would never seen on her face before
all i know is that the idea sprouted in the brain of the old prince nikolai sokolsky, who is sick now, but i have had no part in it and have never spoken of it to anyone
now, however, i have changed my views on that particular point and i no longer believe that education would spoil anything
everything will be amply explained in its proper place because this was my purpose in writing it all down in the first place
from the exchanges between the two of them and from lisa's expression, i gathered that lisa was extremely tense, that she spent most of her days away somewhere attending to matters that concerned her personally
the study was a large, high-ceilinged room, cluttered with all sorts of furniture
you ought to be the last one, my young friend, she went on, looking at the doctor, to talk such utter nonsense because you have known me ever since you were a ten-year-old boy and so i would like you to tell me when was the last time you saw me idle
grushenka, letting out peals of laughter, ran from the room
she gives him that strong stuff perhaps three times a year or so, when he gets those pains around the waist and then gets like paralyzed from the waist down, which happens to him, as i said, about three times a year
snegirev muttered, staring strangely and wildly straight into alyosha’s eyes with the look of a man who has suddenly decided to jump off a mountain peak, while at the same time he forced his lips into a smile, i, sir
he lowered his eyes, still grinning
what exasperated her most was that he still never departed from his calm tone and there was no trace of indignation in what he said about sergei: he simply reasoned logically and arrived at the conclusion that lisa's hero was worthless, and it was his logical detachment that made his irony so exasperating
i said good-by to them and left
as i understand it, in olden times there were probably elders in russia too, but as the country went through a series of calamities—the tartar invasion, civil wars, and isolation from the orthodox east after the fall of constantinople—the institution fell into disuse and the elders vanished from our monasteries
no, wait, here’s smaragdov’s universal history
the man rushed toward the fence
and it was that idiot maria who sewed it in for you!
sit down, for heaven’s sake, grushenka snapped at him impatiently
are you addressing me, sir?
i toss the document on the table and say with infinite scorn: no need for all that—there's nothing i want from you
we must sniff at each other first, he explained
i also want you to know, arkady, that when she came to me the last time, i admitted that i had deceived her and that i had gone to anna with the intention of proposing to her
ah, i ca not make it look decent!
he’s killed gregory,  he says
well, after all that happened and all you said about versilov— that he's not honorable, among other things—and also your general tone all this time  in short, i ca not accept this money from you
but god torments me
the truth is there and that's where i must pursue it!
he was a conscientious physician, a kindly, pious man, a member either of the herrnhuter society or the moravian brethren, i’m not sure which
i wish i’d warned her i’d be late
mother said, for she would become very frightened when versilov had whispered in my ear
that's not true: alphonsine is a spy and lambert is a spy, and maybe you are a spy too!
all that, i had never imagined
there are women here right now, sir—peasant women, the monk replied
alyosha ran over to the fence
the only thing i will say is that it is an original concept, which sets you apart from most of the young people of your generation who, instead of thinking for themselves, pounce upon any available ready-made notions
maximov was smiling again
i realized all this in one of those flashes of complete lucidity that often come over people who are slipping into a completely drunken oblivion but who have not quite reached it
the room was almost completely dark now
alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, despite her injured foot, mrs khokhlakov was more careful than ever about what she wore, that she favored all sorts of new topknots, ribbons, and loose wrappers, and he had a pretty good explanation for this, although he dismissed such thoughts from his mind as frivolous
sergei gave him versilov's address and on the following day a letter of apology addressed to me arrived along with some thirteen hundred rubles that i had left at the roulette table
i was ashamed to be with you, the cringing way you apologized to those poles!
between his fingers were dangling four red ten-ruble bills
i’m sure he’ll be very glad to see you
the devil's song is long, persistent
even his face is completely different
at the beginning of the changes introduced by peter the great, my greatgrandfather—also a peter—remained an old believer and went off to live in the kostroma forests
it was beginning to grow dark and the light in the room came from the lamps and wax candles burning before the icons
but tell me honestly—aren’t you yourself a little ashamed to be with me?
he must have been an important visitor as he was wearing all sorts of distinguished decorations and a family crest
here, this glass here
i’d greatly appreciate it, kartashov, if you’d spare us your asinine remarks when no one has asked for your opinion or, for that matter, is even aware that you exist!
and that's exactly what i did
but you are looking exactly the same way
alyosha just managed to ward it off by raising his arm, and the stone hit his elbow
then he let out a long, arrogant, spiteful chuckle and, with a challenging glare in his eyes, shouted:
i hate myself so for not having come much sooner, kolya said, no longer ashamed of his tears
but these efforts lead not to a full life but to suicide, because, instead of realizing his personality, man only slips into total isolation
it's at home with alphonsine
i’m pretty used to handling money and can tell!
no, it was not me
yes, this is what his heart will cry out
you went to see her
well, i ca not remember everything he said, but i could not hold back my tears the moment i noticed that olga's lips were trembling from gratitude too
a minute white rash appeared on the little girl's tongue, lips, and all around her mouth, and toward evening she died, with her dark eyes fixed on me as though she knew what was happening to her
soon, however, i noticed with considerable surprise that everywhere we went everybody knew her and treated her with great respect
but, again, what could i do?
that would be the end of my torments
some may say that he feigned the fit precisely to avoid being suspected of the murder himself, having told the accused about the money and the signals to lure him to come and kill fyodor karamazov and hoping to beat him to the money
the coffin was no longer there and he wore the clothes he had worn on the night when they had all gathered in his room
ah, now i can see through you once and for all!
the day before abbe rigaud had come to lecture him about his behavior: he walked into the room, planted himself in front of lambert, and proceeded to whimper, throwing his arms in the air, making all sorts of disgusted faces, and reproaching him for his ways
the nonentity shouted in a tone of triumphant viciousness
and the most important fact is that, although until the last moment he didn’t know he would trample those bills underfoot, he certainly had a foreboding of it
how long do you expect me to wait for you to take it?
yes, his own son, he repeated, dragging me toward the ladies without any further explanations
well, that letter, written by the person who made the will, can be interpreted in a sense contrary to the decision of the court
no, she never was
we forgot the bread!
was i really incapable of making a decision?
and how do you know that it was the letter i wrote to andronikov?
once you have chosen your elder, you renounce your own will, you yield it to him in total submission and self-renunciation
i can tell you nothing more on the subject
mr andronikov, who was looking out for versilov's interests, had this letter in his possession and shortly before his death he gave it to me and asked me to put it into a safe place
i grabbed that pestle for the purpose of killing my father, fyodor pavlovich karamazov, by smashing his head with it
it may, of course, seem a strange decision—for a young man to go so late at night, at almost eleven o’clock, to the house of a society lady to whom he had not even been introduced, to possibly rouse her out of bed, and then ask her a question that would sound quite strange under the circumstances
balaam’s ass broods in silence and then, all of a sudden, he comes out with god knows what
no one else will tell it to me
my able colleague, the talented examining magistrate nelyudov, told me later that, at that moment, he felt so immensely sorry for karamazov that he was almost moved to tears
'i am sure there will be no problem because i know many people in petersburg, and some of them are even quite influential
no, not the beatings
the entrance was from the yard and it led into a passage
of course, his assurance was quite unfounded and irresponsible, but it was because of this thoughtlessness and irresponsibility that he felt sure his father would pay him the money and then he would be able to refund the sum to miss verkhovtsev by mailing the three thousand rubles to her relatives
he blessed all the women and bowed low to them
in fact, he was screaming at me today
a man may seem quite inscrutable, but if he bursts into sincere laughter, you will see his whole character as though you were holding it in the palm of your hand
they’ve also brought in a doctor to try and prove i’m mad
do you remember his starting off by saying that everybody is just like the late fyodor karamazov?
he thinks a bit much of himself, though, and i said to him today: you can’t despise the karamazovs, because they’re philosophers rather than scoundrels, just like all real russian people
i wonder whether you could spare me a clean piece of rag or something to bind my finger, alyosha interrupted her suddenly
even though i was caught in a whirlpool and had no one to turn to for guidance and advice, i was fully conscious of my downfall and therefore cannot be excused
sofia was the daughter of an obscure deacon
i think he was just pulling my leg!
beggars surrounded our visitors as soon as they appeared, but nobody gave them anything, except for young kalganov who dug a ten-kopek piece out of his purse and, for some reason looking very embarrassed, pushed it hurriedly into one woman’s hand, muttering something like to share among you
that has nothing to do with it
it is true there was nothing particularly morally reprehensible about the things kolya did, but there was something surprisingly wild and reckless in his behavior
i thought before that i’d sing that hymn,  but i see now that i can’t even get over being pushed around by the guards
besides, the assumption that the witness lied under oath in her first testimony creates a serious possibility that she lied under oath again in her second testimony
then i turned my back on him and tossed my pistol far away, shouting: begone, i have no further need of you!
o divine and saintly elder!
but ivan is no rakitin
tatyana prutkov had suddenly appeared in the doorway, looking very pleased with herself
everything turned bright the moment you came in
i admit, it was stupid of me
the problem facing us now can only be missed by those who are blind
but that’s just it—i cannot make up my mind to do it, although every day i think to myself, go on, do it, you scoundrel!
i can see that you are in love up to your gills with katerina yourself!
he understood nothing of what the presiding judge told him in admonition upon releasing him
ilyusha raised himself and looked admiringly at the toy with his arm still around perezvon’s neck
in truth, i am a living lie, the father of lies
even after he would enlarged his circle of acquaintances considerably, nothing important came lambert's way
there are, makar, versilov suddenly said, there are and 'there should be
above all, i want every little detail
i can simply smell some low scheme on your part
my constant losing humiliated me, made me feel ashamed before sergei, before versilov (although versilov never deigned to talk about it), before everyone, even that woman tatyana prutkov!
but only yesterday i could not believe that one day i would be sitting and talking with my own son
so you told them every word that we said during our talk by the gate?
flashed through miusov’s head
assuming, of course, that you were not raving when you made that confession
however, it was obvious to me that his gaiety, enthusiastic as it may have been, was very brittle and could at any moment turn into complete despondency
she had lost her husband when she was only eighteen, after only a year or so of marriage and soon after bearing him a son
this was a perfectly well-established fact, for there had always been many candidates for those favors, particularly in the past year or two
ah, yes, of course, i believe you fell into the snow
but over me, when i die, they’ll just reel off the little canticle what earthly joy
people shout to the weeping mother
i am quite aware that one is likely to come across plain thieves at the gaming tables, not just common pickpockets from the street but quite well-known gamblers
and so it's really hard to say which of them made the other more miserable
why do you feel you always have to talk to me like that?
after that i did not look at her again and rushed out in a great hurry
now mr karamazov’s voice became peevish and irritated
i will never forget the eager, albeit unemotional and detached, interest with which she heard me out, nor the self-assured expression she had during all that time
but i think i’d better stop there, because you look as if you were about to attack me
i spoke about something quite irrelevant, but i believe i was expressing myself quite articulately now
but i still think that a man who wants to preach honor should be honorable himself
it’s true, alyosha, it was the money that i was smiting with my fist!
perhaps he’s putting all these ideas into mitya’s head—do you think so?
and of whom is he jealous?
facing the icons was a little lamp that was lighted on every holiday
she has spared me
then, supporting me just as he was now, lambert had led me to a cab, eagerly listening to every word i had babbled
but i don’t know you at all, alyosha insisted
i shouted in indignation, for it might have looked as if i had lifted the cover to allow darzan to install himself in the sledge, as though i were his flunkey!
at first, he seemed to skip from one subject to another, as though stumbling on topics at random, without any system
she must be in there!
but their devilish reckoning was based on the knowledge that, in this particular case, the husband would react in the same way whether presented with evidence or not
tell me also, do you ever think about that darkness?
i am sure, for instance, that aferdov, who is well known in all the gambling clubs, is a thief
now look at that!
it would take three big volumes to write it all down, and even then you’d still have to add an epilogue to it!
but tell me this: you were just talking about tatyana
he searched in his briefcase, pulled out a letter, and handed it to me
if it has that thing written on it
love the animals: god has given them the beginnings of thought and untroubled joy
i have come to look at you and to listen to you for a few minutes
don’t you have anything smaller?
on the contrary, they all looked very grave
flung his arms round me, trying to pull me away, shouting at my assailant, let go of him, he’s my papa, please let him go, forgive him!
why are we all sitting here like this?
of course, i realized i would lose everything, for she would run away, but it would have been an infernally clever revenge that would have been worth all the rest
i was ready to rush in at the first sign of danger
ah, never mind about that now
i’m not too good at explaining all these subtleties, but one thing i’m sure of—a thief is viler than an ordinary vile scoundrel
there was also great curiosity about katerina’s rival, grushenka
that occurred to me just then, but i was already so excited and eager to do it that it took my breath away
unlike his brothers, one of whom represents the western’ and the other the russian national’ principle, dmitry karamazov represents russia directly, as it is today, although he certainly does not represent all of modern russia—god forbid that he should!
they brought the boy out of the guardroom
for the first time since my arrival i had money in my pocket (as i mentioned before, i would given my mother the sixty rubles representing my two years' savings)
you weren’t afraid to arouse suspicion then, were you?
may the lord bless you, both you and baby lizaveta
and although she lived in the same house and on the same floor as the fanariotovs, she had her own private two-room suite so that during all the time i would spent there, i would never met any of the fanariotovs
in the first place he had discarded his cassock and now wore instead a very nicely cut jacket and a round felt hat
neither alyosha nor ivan had wanted to live in their father’s house, which now stood empty, and each had his own lodgings
unless you’re planning to help things happen yourself that way
and just when lisa was saying all those things about vasin!
but anyway i’ve already told you i’m waiting for a certain message and, as soon as it arrives, i’ll have to fly off somewhere, and i mean fly off—you’ll see me vanish
the rest of them are doomed to go through dreadful ordeals before they gain the kingdom of god
and never again would that phantom come back to haunt her!
the prior and father paisii tried hard to calm the fidgety crowds
and he told me about money: he says there’ll be ten thousand to pay for my escape and another twenty thousand to start me off in america
gentlemen, give me a chance to tell you everything myself and do not interrupt me to ask irrelevant questions, mitya said excitedly
and i’m sure rakitin will make a career too
let me repeat: it was not stupidity, for most such eccentrics are really quite intelligent and cunning, and their lack of common sense is of a special kind, a national variety
i cried, glancing by chance at the clock on the wall
to tell you the truth, i didn’t expect to see you here, for i never thought you’d be willing to come
i no longer understand anything, anna
oh, never mind, it is still very far to that corner where they will turn into the second street, and, reassured by this thought, the condemned man looks cheerfully to his right and to his left, at all those thousands of curious people who are so unconcerned with what is about to happen to him, and under their fixed stares, he still has the delusion that he is one of them, just another human being
but soon the time came for him to start on one of his drinking bouts and he went at it for three weeks without letup
and finally, in the state he was in, the elder could not possibly have carried on such a long monologue, for he breathed with difficulty, his voice faltered, and he even had to lie down and rest several times, although he never actually went to sleep and his guests never left their seats
but since i do not have those skills, how can i hold forth before others, ignorant as i am?
there's something i would like to tell you
the boys, however, remained convinced that dardanelov simply did not know who the founder of troy was
and they were asleep
that inheritance is not enough
the hell with it!
but, all right, i’ll tell you if you wish
certainly, the prosecutor said, although his answer was rather cool compared with the examining magistrate’s enthusiasm
at long last mrs prutkov was at home
doctor, doctor, sir, is it possible?
her nose was very straight, regular, and just the right length
however, because he had allowed himself to show his joy sincerely, he felt insulted
because all that has vanished, everything is different, and because i want nothing to do with the man who was plotting against you
you know, my boy, i said that judging from myself
perkhotin was met with the stunning news that fyodor karamazov had really been murdered and robbed that night in his house
but that’s nothing compared with your own fasting, reverend father, the visiting monk added in a bolder tone, for you live on nothing but bread and water throughout the whole year, even during easter, and the bread we eat in two days lasts you a whole week
as i spoke, i felt i was falling into a void
i’m sure when you kept nagging me, bring him here, rakitin, just get him here,  i’m sure you had something in mind
then she quickly walked toward the door
but the worst of it is that many of our russian criminal cases indicate a certain state of mind in our society, a sort of general calamity that has taken root among us and that we find more and more difficult to resist as it becomes an omnipresent evil
how was it, how did you put it?
and it was because of that that it seized me
as the hour drew close, kolya lay down between the rails
when the prince came back, he passed by me without looking at me, went over to his desk, and suddenly observed:
i don’t kiss mother earth, i don’t plow her soil
but you have already started, she said, failing to suppress her smile
and you, rakitin, i was about to apologize to you for having insulted you the way i did, but now i don’t feel like doing so
and he convinced me that he’d pull it off all right; every day he told me about the progress he was making
do you mean roulette?
is that how strongly you believed in god?
sergei asked nashchokin, peculiarly emphasizing the question
you’re really slow in understanding, fellow!
but, in appreciation of your frankness, i will tell you just as candidly what i have decided to do
i’m so happy, alexei!
and now i have woken up and the man i love is still here with me
we’ll continue with it in town and, as far as i am concerned, i’m prepared to wish you the best of luck
it so happened that touchard and his wife went out somewhere for the day and i was all alone with agafia
we were taught that by the tartars, who left us the whip to remember them by
the monk asked, becoming bolder and bolder
what chance have we to find it on the floor?
he tore off his shirt impatiently
but never mind, bottoms up!
i thought as i was still holding onto her and swaying to and fro
you’re right, and if you come here often enough, you’ll find out what a wonderful person she is
and what do i care about lisa?
will you be so cynical as to accept it?
smurov fell silent too
she rushed toward me, for i believe i started shivering violently or perhaps i even fainted
he inquired with sympathy
he picked it up from the table and handed it to me
besides, it was some sort of holiday, so i was sure he would be back soon
and don’t feel embarrassed when you eat those pancakes
can it be the revulsion i feel for father’s house?
i don’t remember where my brother was that day, but there were only the two of us—my mother and i it was a bright, sunny day and i remember clearly the incense rising from the censer and wafting slowly upward, while from a little window in the cupola sunbeams streamed down into the church, and it looked as if the incense, rising in waves, was melting in the sunlight
he had to know at once
for now, i tried to soften the blow for sergei
that still doesn’t convince me that you were wide awake, fetyukovich snapped sarcastically, and there was more subdued laughter
i gave him one of those scornful looks as if to say, here, go on, take another stab at me if you like, since that’s your way of showing your appreciation for all i’ve done for you
suppose you decided to fire this bullet into your brain, wouldn’t you have a good look at it first while loading your gun?
otherwise, why should i have dreamt about that babe’ at such a moment?
my head ached, my temples throbbed, my heart was pounding
but now he no longer cared
and, for god's sake, do not bring your brother to me
alyosha looked at her intently
otherwise, of course, they were all dr herzenstube’s regular patients
i sat down across the table from him and i had the feeling that i was the incarnation of fever and delirium facing him, the incarnation of the golden mean and common sense
that’s right, sir, it had pepper in it too
i will go to her, throw myself at her feet, and say to her: you were right when you passed me by
he could just have come to, as patients afflicted with the falling sickness usually do
it would be all right,  he said, if you believed in virtue at least, and said: let them not believe me, i must still tell them as a matter of principle!
what i am after is something that can be acquired through power and only through power: that is self-sufficiency and a calm awareness of my strength
alyosha did not want to call him or try to catch him, for he knew it would be to no avail
now you’re going a bit far, lise!
the purpose was to find out how the trial would have come out if contemporary laws had been applied and if modern court procedures, with defense counsels, prosecutors, et al, had been followed
that’s just the trouble, it’s all too real
and she was not putting this on
it would have been better if you would strangled me at birth
how can i tell you that you don’t know what exaltation is?
but at that second, lisa pushed me behind a curtain and we found ourselves in a little space by a bay window
i see that you’re interested in such worldly questions
ilyusha hugged the dog hard, stretched himself out, and buried his face in the shaggy fur
versilov will kill her!
no one had suggested i do so
i offered him three thousand rubles
and it's time you learned to pack your things yourself; you ca not expect always to have someone waiting on you
i kept it for three days, but grew too ashamed of myself, gave the coin back, and admitted what i’d done
she quite surprised me
however, i have no right to judge anyone
that means he’ll be ferocious and you’ll have to keep him chained, kolya commented expertly, as if he had come especially to examine the pup and its black nose, although in fact he was still trying to overcome the alarming feeling inside him that he might suddenly begin to cry like one of those little boys
we would have become very close friends if he had spoken to me about himself, but he practically never said a word about his private affairs; he only seemed interested in talking about me
that's how it is in this world: every soul is tried and is consoled
oh, i would have learned about that horrible, sinister intrigue without him!
i realize that it came out sounding banal, superficial, crude, and even somehow younger than my age
again, i won’t give a lengthy account of their childhood and school years, but will only outline the most important facts
although i had not in the least expected to see him there, the very second i saw him i guessed who he was, while still failing to understand how he could have spent all those days so close to me without my ever hearing a sound from him
everybody noticed an important decoration which flashed on his front for all to see
but when smurov had vaguely told krasotkin that alyosha was planning to come and see him on very important business, kolya had told him to go and tell that karamazov fellow that krasotkin knew what to do himself, that he needed no advice, and that if he decided to go and see ilyusha, he would go in his own good time, and that he had his own reasons for acting the way he was acting
i’ll tell you our secret, mitya whispered hurriedly
i guess you’re right, alyosha said with a smile, and i only hope you’re not making fun of me now, ivan
so lambert had already met versilov, had succeeded in getting to him, and in contacting anna too!
i was simply trying to make you look at things from where i stand
she gave me an alarmed, questioning look
i love life; i am horribly afraid for my life; in that respect i am an awful coward
i’m sorry, you’re right, it wasn’t you, it was i who was screaming
she holds the white roses that had been placed in her hand when they had laid her in the coffin
perhaps you’re the superior one and not ivan, after all
mrs prutkov shrieked and literally sank her nails into my shoulder
thus, by not denying it, i did in a way confirm lambert's lie
i am the greatest doctor in moscow, he said, so what do you mean by sending for me for such a trifling thing when all moscow is waiting for me?
ah, dolgoruky, why should i lie?
for if you felt i was likely to do it and nevertheless you left, that was just like saying to me: go ahead, kill my father
and if he had not had that unfortunate pestle, he might or might not have struck his father, but he certainly would not have killed him
he had already gone down the hall several times, entered the rooms of the doctor’s wife, and glanced worriedly at the children who, still sitting obediently over the book, smiled broadly at him each time he came in, hoping he would do something very funny and fantastic
but it doesn’t make much difference, it’s the same sort of thing
it was summertime, and a pigeon entered a window of the cupola, flew across it and out the window on the opposite side
oh, he felt quite exultant internally, so much had been gained by that testimony!
it had been paid for by katerina
but it's all restlessness
all this, as well as the talk we had the evening before it all happened, i’ve told dr herzenstube and also the examining magistrate, mr nelyudov, and they took it all down and they have it all in writing
the boy said it to you, not to us, you fool
she had followed tikhomirov's tirade intently
ah, good god, what a coincidence!
as i could hardly stand up, he had to support me as he led me away
shall i give up and leave?
miusov shouted, as though no longer able to bear it
as to her, well, again this is a matter for her to decide rather than for me, as i already told you
i’m sure he fully appreciates that and, besides, he asked me to tell you how sorry he is
or was he just pretending not to see them?
i have a charming little pamphlet translated from french
but he certainly loved people: throughout his life he seemed to believe in people and trust them, and yet no one ever thought him simple-minded or naive
she had heard him say things just as peculiar before
although, it's almost impossible for a third person to understand fully the relations between two people in love, i know that sergei was bitterly reproachful all the time, for, believe it or not, he was madly jealous!
tell me, had you ever seen twenty thousand rubles before?
she has nothing, nothing, to do with it!
wait for the verdict!
and i confess that even now, when everything is over, i am completely at a loss as to how to judge that unhappy man who made things so hard for us
but he was still grinning and looked at ivan with the same composure
a latin translation of hippocrates' greek motto (what medicine cannot cure, iron will cure; what iron cannot cure, fire will cure) was found in dolgushin's (dergachev in the adolescent) summer house where his subversive tracts were printed
these are the moments when we recognize in the accused the animal terror that seizes him when he realizes that all is lost, although he continues to fight back because his instinct for self-preservation has been aroused
you are really distressing me, katerina, my dear, mrs prutkov said in a pleading tone
and if i am right, if they cannot forgive, what harmony can there be?
he confided all these thoughts to me when he came to see me, for he came to my house every day, as i was his only friend
listen, olympe, the prince had no idea that mrs akhmakov was due to arrive today
yes, that’s right, mitya said, glancing absentmindedly at his hands
had i not been in such a state of wild agitation, i certainly would not have fired such a question at a man whom i had never met before, of whom i had only heard
he had not yet thought out what to say, how to answer our questions, but he was ready for us with his stubborn denial: i did not kill my father!
so you think i am something of a chameleon, do you?
he showed them the little hole for priming and explained to them about the recoil
from that point of view, i would be rather curious to have a look at you, if i had time to bother with it all now
i did not quite understand her at first
mitya exclaimed with great delight
do you really imagine that a man, endowed with relentless energy, who's always on the alert, who's always thinking and calculating, who's always on the go, watching for an opportunity, that such a man wo not acquire enough know-how to earn every day, say, twenty kopeks more than he spends on his upkeep?
it took about three hours to get to volovya, where mitya at once ordered post-horses for the drive back to town
our town was just like anywhere else: at first, immediately following the preliminary investigation, mitya’s relatives and other people who wanted to visit him had to submit to certain regulations
the corners of his lips quivered
what about ten gold half-imperials?
i was in a great hurry
mrs prutkov exclaimed, jumping up from her seat with such suddenness that she took me completely by surprise
it was just after trifon had learned about all this that he met mitya in the darkness, going back into the house from the balcony, and that mitya noticed that something had changed both in trifon’s attitude and in the way he spoke
then, if i insisted too rigorously on settling the matter of my inheritance, she could have me thrown into debtor’s prison
no one in the whole world can possibly know what i’m going through
rakitin muttered, somewhat taken aback
this is a perfectly proper news item in society life
and how could he know you have forgiven him?
and, true enough, it was getting quite late
i was very drunk and the gypsies were singing
then, in petersburg, there was that auction sale i have already mentioned when i made in one go seven rubles and ninety-five kopeks profit
alas, you must not believe that men can be united in this way
i will come and see you or you will come and see me
as the man crying out those words is felled, his skull broken; and then there is a stream of phrases, statements, gestures, and exclamations, all of which could bias people’s opinions, sway their feelings
i mean you, grushenka, you helped me to recover my soul just now
and he had been dreaming all night about the scene he had witnessed between the two women
that long-legged bastard—two days ago, he made my life miserable in front of respectable people
why haven’t you been to see us for so long?
what we had said was quite enough, on top of what our eyes had told each other
you must be making fun of me!
no, you haven’t stolen from her, since you’ll give it back to her
there was one thing in his manner, however, of which the ladies did not approve—that was the way he bent his back
one, for instance, would suggest to another: i’ll tell him i lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it—and this, just to have something to tell, just to satisfy the elder
remember how we used to look together for what you referred to as facts?
what do you want of me now?
out of their way, mitya!
christ, she said, will forgive everything, arkasha
why, i believe you told me you were only thirteen!
later, those words were remembered and discussed
their combined wisdom and their desperate efforts to create a nobler man with greater dignity, the ideal set by christ, have come to naught
if you have something the matter with your nose, for instance, they’ll send you to paris where, they say, there is the foremost nose specialist in europe
when he says something like that, it is always the truth
about ten days after the funeral, katerina, agafia, and agafia’s aunt left for moscow
beauty is a terrifying thing!
wasn’t it in your pocket?
he worked somewhere on vasilievsky island and as a rule came home punctually just before noon
yes, dmitry said, i may very well have told grushenka about that fateful day, as katya likes to call it
i have always remembered the promise i made to lisa to reform and start a new life
that reasonable man, i understand, gave the most precise explanations and provided very interesting information that fully vindicated him in the eyes of those on whom his fate depended
when friends came to see him, he would say to them: it’s so nice of you to come, for i don’t know what i’ve done to earn your love and i can’t begin to understand how you can love someone like me, nor can i understand how i could have failed to appreciate it until now
to whom else could i come back when everything's over?
well, be honest, never tell lies, do not covet your neighbor's house
all of a sudden, ferapont’s countenance changed completely
is that a decent way to act?
eighteen months ago he could have pulled off a perfect deal with that baby, but he fell on his face, yes, siree!
why should i go to chermashnya?
finally, her plan had been approved by lambert
if that’s the way it is—it was you who killed him all right, smerdyakov hissed
i was both very surprised and very frightened, for i had never yet been treated so roughly
by that you mean you’ll act as if everything is permitted’?
they asked me some questions, i answered something or other, and they allowed me to leave
for if you lose interest out of idleness, supercilious pride, or, worst of all, greed, others will come from all directions and snatch your flock from you
but you did not want to deprive man of freedom and you rejected this suggestion, for, you thought, what sort of freedom would they have if their obedience was bought with bread?
that would really finish him off, for to this moment he does not really believe that such a letter exists
and it was during this moment of exaltation that our prosecutor rose to his feet to object to some points brought up by the defense
he came into the room, picked up his top hat, glanced at the mirror, ran his fingers through his hair, and, without even turning his head in my direction, went out into the corridor and stopped by the door to the room of the two women
however, to this day, i believe in that strange promise, and i want to record it so i will always remember it
but, try as hard as i would, i could not remain detached
alyosha took his, took a few sips, and put it back on the table
makar's letters were answered promptly by my mother in very much the same style
by now martha had reached rock bottom in horror
i asked you to come in because i had something important for you
and then there is the son breaking into his father’s house, killing him and, at the same time, not killing him
whereupon katerina broke off their engagement then and there
as alyosha entered, snegirev hardly glanced at him
her features are still the same, but now every single one of these features seems to have been twisted and distorted by an unimaginable impudence
and men rejoice at being led like cattle again, with the terrible gift of freedom that brought them so much suffering removed from them
but did such a murder occur?
and her guess was almost correct: actually, i did feel something of the sort at the time
kolya was shouting at the top of his voice and beaming with delight
you treat money as if it were garbage or water
therefore, we may ask ourselves what could have kept him alive?
mitya tried to object
gregory obviously was more familiar with the garden than the stranger and, realizing that the other man was dashing toward the bathhouse, took a short cut
friends and teachers, i have often heard, and of late more than ever, that our clergy, particularly our rural clergy, complain bitterly over their lowly status and the low stipends they receive
ah, damn it, why did i have to stumble on lambert just then when i was feeling overcome by all these thoughts?
but, all right, let us assume that it was open and that the accused denied it and lied, claiming that it was closed out of an instinct of self-preservation, which would be quite understandable under the circumstances
i can say that because i know him well
he listened in silence, never commenting when i mentioned the rumor about sergei marrying anna, and when i repeated my enthusiastic praise of anna's qualities, he just muttered something to the effect that she was a nice girl
and, besides, what can prince sergei hope for from mrs akhmakov?
please go to lise and cheer her up, as you always do so well
how can a man realize that he has acted despicably, admit it, and then continue acting in the same way?
he had a large billiard room with all the proper furnishings, that is, even with black-framed pictures of english race-horses hanging on the walls, the type always found in the billiard room of a single man
but for two days now, since the time i would met him in the street and had announced theatrically that i would return the letter to katerina at mrs prutkov's, lambert had organized a sort of surveillance of mrs prutkov's apartment or, to be more precise, he would enlisted the finnish maid to spy for him
why, is there anyone who doesn’t wish his father’s death?
but certainly, even during their first conversation, he must have succeeded in hinting very clearly that i had a certain letter in my possession, that he—lambert—was the only person who knew i had the letter, and that i was planning to use it to avenge myself on mrs akhmakov, and so on and so forth
these words brought many thoughts to my mind
actually, she went to the registry office and got mr versilov's address
but the second he came in, i asked him about it
that day was the first time i would seen mother and versilov together
the word parricide’ is simply one of those words that frighten us because we have not grasped its meaning and so find ourselves in the position of ostrovsky’s ignorant characters
i walked over to dergachev, pressed his hand as hard as i could, and shook it violently
and then there were those contradictions in him: he was proud and at the same time slavishly devoted to me; but despite that slavish devotion he could flare up at any moment and start arguing with me, fly into a rage, and not agree with anything
so let us never forget him, let us always treasure his memory in our hearts, now and always!
it sounded like an incantation
kolya said nervously and quickly
in the back room of the little cafe, they really were serving oysters and we installed ourselves at a little table covered with a stained, greasy cloth
that, of course, can be said of the young people of any generation, but i believe it's especially true of this one
that’s very important material evidence
he could just as well have said that her love had its roots in the institution of serfdom!
such is their incurable instinct
but since i climb up to the attic every day, why shouldn’t i fall from the attic again tomorrow?
you mean that you apply them to us and that you regard us as socialists?
i felt terribly offended
men have suddenly realized that they have been left on earth completely alone and they feel like abandoned children
she cried again with uncontrollable emotion
they had obviously been waiting for just that moment in the belief that the healing powers of the dead man would at once become effective
now, when ivan stopped, words gushed from him, as if he could no longer hold them back
it was only because i was so annoyed that i had refused to go to anna's before
oh, what a contemptible creature i was!
since i have cash at home, i’ll take three thousand rubles with me and tell them that smerdyakov gave me the money
still, there was that duplicity—i mean the suspicion of duplicity—that tormented me
i knew that he had serious differences with his father and i always believed that his father had taken undue advantage of him
you needn’t worry, i’ll save him for you!
suddenly that broad smile of his reappeared on his face, but this time he was looking at me firmly, no longer puzzled as before
he was actually gnashing his teeth with rage!
at the same time, however, an acute anguish from the uncertainty of the situation mounted within him
and, on this point at least, i fully share the opinion of that pseudo-great man
julia, hurry, go to the cellar and get me a piece of ice, and also another bowl of water
but do you know what would be best?
shortly after getting the four-year-old mitya off his hands, fyodor karamazov married a second time
nothing beyond this leaked out, and it was in this form that the report appeared in the press with only the participants' initials
besides, i want him, too
the time has come when you must hear what i have to tell you, because otherwise you won’t even be able to understand what this two hundred rubles means to me, the poor man went on, gradually working himself up into a state of wild exuberance
it was a pretty long wait, an hour perhaps, for it was close to nine when they finally came to fetch me
you’re the one who said that everything was permitted, so why are you so worried now?
it was a bleak, foggy, raw day—an ideal day for hunting
on the other hand, if your father dies right now before anything of that sort happens, each of the three of you is sure to get forty thousand right away, even mr dmitry, whom mr karamazov hates so much, because there happens to be no will
however, it was not until quite recently that he succeeded in attracting the attention of a wider circle of readers, and it was one particular incident that made them notice and remember him—and a rather curious incident at that
could you, for instance, have said what year it was if someone had asked you?
and, indeed, the four officials were very minor, three of them already gray-haired (and the fourth only somewhat younger), none of them known in our society, people who probably eked out a living on a small salary, were married to elderly and unpresentable wives, and had many children who probably ran around barefoot
there is so much in it that is great, mysterious, inconceivable!
why, you’ll be back tomorrow, won’t you?
he smiled slyly and raised one finger
i am madly happy, madly happy!
we are late as is
and then, last summer on st peter's day, i again found myself in that desert—god just willed it that way— and when i walked into his cell, i saw it standing there, that thing, the microscope; he had ordered it from abroad and paid a lot of money for it
they’ll think it because i gave away the big secret about the signals
probably he meant is not it just like her?
also, he had very little time: he had other business to attend to elsewhere that same morning, so he had to be very quick about it
the ransom, madam, the ransom!
go now, and fear nothing
once every member of the human race discards the idea of god (and i believe that such an era will come, like some new geological age), the old world-view will collapse by itself without recourse to cannibalism
at that moment a door slammed and someone walked quickly into the next room
don’t be frightened of him
i do not agree with you—it's not up to me at all; my hands are tied, do not you see?
i noticed that he looked at me now and then out of the corner of his eye, but mostly he looked out of the window and pretended to be busy with his schoolwork, although i knew very well he did not have his mind on his lessons
he had reached the last degree of irritation
mitya was led away
indeed, he did not wish to pursue the matter any further and turned away from me
when they heard me coming up, they turned their backs to the door and watched me attentively
if i care to be friends with someone, it’s my own business and i don’t have to account to anyone—that’s the way i feel about it
good-by then, kiss me once more
so it shall be and so be it!
but he broke his motion in mid-air
so some time later, i was sitting just as i’m sitting now when that general comes in, the same general, you know, who came here during holy week
yes, money came into it too
i am not saying that their lives are bound to be disorderly and ugly; on the contrary, i feel it would be improper and ugly if they settled down and wound up resembling ordinary people
in a large, legible hand he had written on it: i condemn myself for my past life and i sentence myself to suffer for the rest of my life
at last the presiding judge declared the case concerning the murder of fyodor pavlovich karamazov open—i don’t remember the exact wording of the declaration
in a frightened voice
that apartment, you know, was rented in my name and it's mrs prutkov who's paying the rent
no time for oysters, mitya remarked, and, besides, i’m not hungry
all right, he said in the end, now go and play and live some of life for me
what if he's insane?
here it is, alyosha said, taking katerina’s note out of his pocket
but even so, i will come back to you, to you, my last angel
gradually a cheerful and rather unattractive group of passengers formed around him
i recognized my sister lisa
what can you know about it anyway?
then sergei, who had remained in the room, went up to zershikov and demanded that he publicly proclaim my innocence and, moreover, that he apologize to me in a formal letter
that visibly annoyed lisa, but vasin persisted
i put expensive clothes on his back; i bought him an embroidered shirt and nice leather shoes for his feet, and i am treating him as if he was the son of a general, but i see he still is not grateful
no, it's not his baby at all!
but, anyway, i’m going far away and i won’t come back
i felt i was dressed very decently: my suit and my overcoat were quite new and my linen was perfectly clean (maria had seen to that especially for this occasion)
ah, never mind, i would recover and somehow make up for whatever blame i might have had in this business—i had fifty years before me to do it!
after that, i wondered which i should do: send the letter and stay alive or send it and die?
i may be witty, but if a talleyrand or a piron[] came along, my wit would appear dull in comparison with theirs
he sent for two of his aunts who were shopkeepers somewhere in the province
yes, that’s just what they do
but i do not suppose you can understand what i mean
we cannot afford to pay so much for a ticket
the elder looked at him smilingly and said:
and i also heard his idiotio theory that if there is no immortality of the soul, there can be no virtue and therefore everything is permissible
i remained standing where i was
then, describing a full circle, he made the sign of the cross eight times in succession, once on each wall and once in each corner
that elder is the pride and glory of the monastery
i know for a fact that there are people who get more and more excited with every blow when they beat someone, until they experience a sensual joy, a real, voluptuous pleasure, stronger and stronger as they go on
you are going to moscow tomorrow!
i’d rather suffer all my life than that
miusov said in a shaking voice, feeling that he was losing control over himself
do not be angry with us, arkasha—there are plenty of intelligent people without us in the world, but who will there be to love us if we lose one another?
well, what the hell do i care—if he wants it to have overtones, it can have them
anyway, i had to go and find out!
but then he started whispering into the policeman's ear
what do you think, for instance, he’s been talking about now?
people here are third rate—they are just a bunch of young hoodlums, he later complained to me
the other five boys now had their eyes riveted on alyosha
such things are usually answered by a challenge and so, first of all, i want to settle our money accounts
i wrote it as a joke, for i consider poetry writing a despicable occupation
for if you repine, as you were repining just now, and declare that you would be glad to have your nose pulled every day of your life, your wish has indirectly been fulfilled because, having lost your nose, you have had it permanently pulled off, as it were
in fact, you went through three thousand that time
didn’t you hear the bell announcing the service?
you proposed to anna officially and she rejected you?
no, he wanted to come only for a moment to visit his children and he chose to appear where the fires were crackling under the heretics
and so, realizing he was at fault and sincerely regretting his behavior, but being too embarrassed to come here and apologize in person, he asked his son ivan and myself to convey to you his profound apologies and regrets
now, since the accused assures us that he is not the murderer, it must be smerdyakov, for there was no one else about who could have done it
once i had gotten myself something to wear, i knew that it would last me a long time
tell her i agree with her, that i deserve the names she calls me, if that makes her feel any better
as to the other pole, who sat by the wall at some distance and looked at the company with scorn and defiance as he listened to the general conversation, mitya noticed only that he was a little younger than the one on the sofa
i was still looking fixedly at the teacher as i spoke
well, then, i turn to that imbecile and i say to him, i’m looking at the geese because i’m trying to figure out what they’re thinking about
why, you are looking cheerful today!
it was not quite one o'clock yet
but i shall come to that later, for i want the events to unfold before you step by step, in proper order
that shows how important you were to him
i wrote a letter to my former regimental commander and my brother officers in which i confessed my lies and fully vindicated stepanov's honor
that did not bother me at all because i myself had no idea how come
it was our carpenter who made the coffin
who's paying for your clothes, who's feeding you and giving you money to play roulette?
and she was right
perkhotin installed himself on the chair opposite him and the champagne was on the table in no time
why did you have to pester me that way, then, for such a long time?
this is the man who’s made such a hell, such a nightmare, of my life!
perhaps it was just pleasant to brag, to say, see all the money i threw away
and what’s that now?
and if i was in no state then to make anything of it, at least i did notice it
as i have said, i was already almost out of my mind
and you must go
his direct family was small: he had been a widower for twenty years and had only one daughter, the widow of a general, who was expected to arrive any day from moscow, probably a young woman of character, whom he obviously feared
from my own words he had gathered how much i valued the letter and how afraid i was that someone might take it away from me
she was a consumptive seventeen-year-old girl, incredibly beautiful i understand, but also highly eccentric
what if a patient, whose sores you were cleaning, instead of being grateful to you, tormented you with his whims and had no appreciation whatsoever for your services to mankind, talked rudely to you, or even complained about you to your superiors, as people who are in pain so often do?
alphonsine gets sick just looking at him and wo not let him near her
so, fourteen years ago i fell into the hands of the living god’—that’s how those fourteen years are to be described
the blood rushed to his head
i must now confess why i was so enthusiastic about vasin's theory of ideas transmuted into feelings
they washed gregory’s head with water and vinegar, and this brought him back to his senses
all you need to know is that, about a month ago, she sent for me and gave me three thousand rubles that she wanted me to mail to moscow, to her sister and some other relative of hers
she jumped up and, with the shriek of a wounded animal, rushed out of the room so unexpectedly that no one had time to stop her, and dashed straight toward where mitya was
we have started our romance and i want to be given a chance to complete it
there's really nothing so marvelous about people to bother much about them
i saw that lukeria wanted to ask me something, perhaps even send me on some errand or other, but that was really the last thing i needed!
and then something else happened: the money that had been lying in front of zershikov's very nose and that belonged to the bank—four hundred rubles in all—had vanished and zershikov was pointing at the spot where it had been just a moment before, right next to me, next to the spot where my own money was piled up, much closer to me than to aferdov
but what is it, mother dear?
yesterday you asked me for three hundred rubles, here!
if you wish, sir, you can tip me five rubles, but i won’t accept more
a score of visitors, this time all peasant women, were waiting below by the gallery built outside the hermitage wall
suppose that young man wanted to borrow money or find out an address, or something like that?
this is my last message to you: seek happiness through sorrow
rien, rien du tout
every woman is a snake and every snake is a woman!
and, grabbing her scarf and fur coat, the old lady burst out onto the landing, putting on her coat as she ran downstairs
so obviously i am a born flunkey!
it's almost autumn, the weather is bright, but sometimes there's a crisp edge in the air
his saintly elder died today, you know, the holy father zosima
allow me to stay here, alyosha murmured beseechingly
so it is quite beyond me why you have made such a mystery of the fifteen hundred rubles that you supposedly put aside from the three thousand you had misappropriated earlier
i could easily do without their bread—i don’t need it at all: i could go into the forest and live on mushrooms and berries, while here they can’t leave, for they can’t do without the bread they’re given
'i see,  he said; t know,  he said, 'your merchant will pay you if he feels like it and he wo not if he does not, but if you try to sue him you will only be out of pocket even more
i believe he's a man who can set himself gigantic tasks and perhaps can even carry them out but who refuses to account to anyone for anything he does
what von sohnish trick did you play on them?
do you know how to sew, then?
et je te benis!
first, there's the difference in age and, secondly, i have not even got a real name
yesterday, when he learned of smerdyakov’s death, he was so shocked by the news that it did, in fact, drive him insane
ivan cried, almost in despair
in that case, why not come to my place?
it’s just as if they’d stolen it from you!
you take your way and i’ll take mine
what about my own self-esteem, and what about lisa to whom i lied and whom i intended to desert?
but i am sure you must have heard that versilov broke an icon into two yesterday
wouldid you hear,  you said, 'how this boy, at his age, recited the lines
katerina seemed very agitated, and yet determined
then they could help themselves to a cup and come back and carry on to the end
n-no, he said, i didn’t come with karamazov
then he told me casually that this was a peculiarity that the prince had developed only since his illness, in fact, quite a recent development
much longer than that even—i could calculate it for you if you gave me a pencil and a piece of paper
what is it, kolya?
just imagine, he graduated from a good cadet corps school, even served briefly as an ensign in a regiment!
i said that at the table yesterday just to tease you, and i saw how your eyes were shining
versilov was not in the room
and later, speaking of the lawyer, who almost succeeded in having the case dismissed, he remarked: and what's a lawyer but a conscience for hire
he walks among them in silence, a gentle smile of infinite compassion on his lips
people seem to be quarreling all the time up there, and today his wife even retired to her room in tears
you’ve hit the bull’s eye, mr ivan, and i’m sure you’ll act like the clever man you are
perhaps he ought to have been shot, to satisfy the moral indignation that such an act arouses in us?
maxim, who was two rooms away, heard the crash and roared with anger
but she was obviously relieved to know that sergei's statement had not substantially aggravated vasin's case
why, you just said
i don’t want any praise from that stinking mob!
the great conquerors, the tamerlanes and the genghis khans, who swept like whirlwinds across the earth, striving to subdue the whole world, were also, even if they were unaware of it themselves, obeying that eternal human craving for universal union
do you know what happened after that?
i think you are simply annoyed because you have not been very brilliant today
you’re mistaken, alyosha, my dear boy, he said, looking at his brother with an expression that alyosha had never seen on his face before: there was a youthful sincerity in it and a feeling too strong to conceal
you don’t know me!
they even crackled like new bills as he smoothed them out
and she turned out to be right
you could have guessed because my begging you not to go all the way to moscow but only to chermashnya showed that i wanted you to be closer to us, and thought that, knowing that you weren’t too far away, your brother, mr dmitry, wouldn’t dare be so bold
first of all, prince sergei never recovered and died in the prison hospital before his trial was scheduled to begin
he felt more and more ashamed of himself for having told these people so sincerely and in such soul-searching detail about his pangs of jealousy over grushenka
the temperature had dropped now and, after a warm day, it was beginning to freeze
mitya examined the face with immense hatred
having vowed to remain silent, as i explained in the previous chapter, i expected to keep my vow
right, sir, so i reckon they may still be up if they’re playing cards
his reading of godly things lent his face an even graver expression
as for my biliousness, well, you have been treating me for a year now and if you have not been able to cure me all this time, that's not much credit to you, is it?
i immediately noticed versilov's irritation, which was unusual for him
where did you have coffee?
he could have been delirious when he came to
oh, never, never would they be able to feed themselves without us!
i was painfully surprised
and since i was not consulted when the world was created, i reserve the right to express my opinion on the subject
it’s because he feels for her, for his mother, he feels sorry for her
to go back to alyosha, he was a special friend of the inspector’s and the old man liked to discuss abstruse subjects with him
he leaned his head toward me
in the end, she was hardly ever at home during the day, for it goes without saying that she also visited sergei in prison
do you have any idea what the word wife’ means?
she doesn’t see it, though
i don’t want them to be warned
i assume that everything was settled within one hour of prince sergei's visit to her—which only goes to show how ill timed his noble gesture was
and so the church, acting like a tender and loving mother, will take no part in meting out punishment because, even without the church, a man condemned by the state courts is sufficiently punished, and there should be someone, after all, to take pity on him
no, he began again, there’s so much in life and there’s life underground, too
wait, he said, sitting up on the sofa, about an hour ago i took that towel from over there, wet it, and held it against my head
when they met they only dared exchange timid and fleeting glances
nelyudov stopped insisting, although when his eyes met the prosecutor’s he understood from his colleague’s look that all hope was not yet lost
it’s a good thing you came, ivan said dreamily, as if he hadn’t heard alyosha’s last exclamation
i always arrive exactly on time, knowing that punctuality is the courtesy of kings
you’re no better than a brat yourself; indeed, you’re as bad as the youngest of those urchins!
here the prosecutor decided to outline the character of the late smerdyakov, who, according to him, had put an end to his life in a fit of violent madness
he gave me time to recover and then asked: well, what do you say to that, old man?
i wouldn’t think of refusing it, not for one moment, rakitin said in a hoarse voice
whatever the elder predicted, especially with such precision, was bound to happen
but the cart moved off, and their hands were separated
it’s true, though, he had not yet seen the man
and that sum i’m waiting for
let me tell you, then, that this dream, as you call it, will most certainly come true
she stopped dead when she saw me
but i see it turns out to be, relatively speaking, only a minor misappropriation of three thousand rubles, and moreover, probably only a temporary misappropriation, which i suppose could be considered simply an irresponsible act, but certainly not something that would disgrace a man once and for all
i was completely bewildered
just let me have my pistols now
the church would aim at the total, true regeneration of man, his spiritual rebirth, and the salvation of his
next day he came back from school looking terrible, all pale in the facewhat’s the matter, ilyusha?
at the same time, i realized that people who were unquestionably my inferiors knew how to behave with amazing dignity, and that drove me into a fury and made me lose my self-control even more
he wants to stop me from marrying her, and he is encouraging that good-for-nothing to marry her
baron bjoring's position and his reputation forbid him from stooping
this thought gave me courage and, despite the confusion in my mind, cheered me up
no, you will never know, mother, how much i loved you then!
and since people gossip anyway, they would only gossip more wickedly
yes, she was in rather a hurry!
and they got hold of me too, shouting, you were in it with him
that made rakitin lose his temper altogether
he did not try to hide his views, just the contrary, and this enables me to speak boldly of him, not as a private individual, of course, but as a member of the karamazov family
is it possible that the world as it is today will come to an end just because of finance?
now i feel all dirty inside having told you all that
but i refused to think about it
how much will he understand of what's going on?
well, anyway, there's nothing else left for us to do
he had lived in our town for many years and had always behaved with great dignity
so what happened when he finally finished his walk?
vous avez de i'argentp no?
let me try to make clear what i mean by a comparison or rather by a parallel
his headache was getting worse and worse
when she heard these things, she would comment to her lady companions: it serves her right
i’ve come, alyosha muttered, feeling he was getting mixed up, i came
it doesn’t seem as if my heart will ever stop palpitating—i can’t wait any longer
it's true that he himself told me that day that he was feeling happy and elated and that he was aware he was talking with great abandon
you see, i pinched her mob-cap because i needed a rag
he would refuse it if it was offered to him
they may give us some change
she had a good go at it!
grushenka walked quickly over to her desk, opened a drawer, took out a purse, fished out a twenty-five-ruble bill, and handed it to rakitin
and you know, alexei, there’s no need for you to bother to come back; when you’ve finished with katerina, you may as well go straight to the monastery, because that’s where you really belong
you had a streak of bad luck, pan kalganov, the little pole remarked
i would noticed that, although we would arrive together, he would always manage to slip away from me during the evening and never thought of introducing me to any of the people in his set
so how could i help being exasperated with myself when i realized into what a helpless creature gambling could turn me?
this, of course, is the result of adopting reforms when the ground is unprepared, especially when the reforms are copied from abroad and alien institutions are transplanted
why do they let such people in?
i am here to drive out your guests—the unholy devils that are here with you
he banged his forehead?
you know, though, that it is not us you will harm, but yourself, nelyudov said a bit nervously
why, of course, why should not she get involved in some plot with him too?
for i am certain, and so are all the jurists, that, without this, the accused would at least have been given the benefit of mitigating circumstances
but you’re trying to buy the wood from him—the wood!
but that was none of my concern and i went right on drinking and having a wild time
what kind of a question is that?
the prince had not been informed about the impending arrival of his daughter and did not expect her for another week or so
and that, of course, was more important than spending the money on wild parties; karamazov certainly felt that, knew it
i’ve already thought it all over
well, you must go now, my bereaved boy
i may be asked now why they had to bring him to the apartment where i rented a room
his whole mentality can be summed up in the words: après moi le déluge
soldier’s curiosity was hot:
never seen anyone so bloodthirsty!
when he first arrived, alyosha had seemed to be pondering deeply about something, perhaps trying to decide whether he would be able to give up all or only a couple of rubles
oh, it was not just the blood that was being shed at that time that depressed me, nor the burning of the tuileries, but rather all the things that were to follow
and, by the way, that sweet brother of yours left for moscow today
ah, here you are at last!
i managed to control myself and bear her tenderness, but how i hated her at that moment!
the bustling shop attendants hurriedly reassured him in sugary tones that the crate in question contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne and a few items of immediate necessity, such as cold snacks and pastry, as well as some sweets, candy, etc
i would heard a lot about him and had seen him many times, although he did not know me at all
now, i see no reason to conceal from you that gregory himself says that he concluded that you must have just come out of that door, although he did not actually see you do so, since he first caught sight of you when you were already in the middle of the garden, running toward the fence
the fellow had waited for this opportunity for such a long time, and now he certainly got it all off his chest
olga glanced at her, hesitated for a second, gave me a quick scornful look, turned, and went back into her room
i like your face, alyosha
my boy, versilov said firmly, not one kopek of that money is mine
and his only reason for doing it was that the man had been running occasional errands for me, in connection with a certain business of mine
you did it in the street, without scissors?
he sat there sunk in thought, but he could not find an answer
but i didn’t quite understand—did they really take you to court for it, before a judge?
i’ve already told you that!
and tell me, mamma, do you still remember that dove in the village church?
there was a moment when i too believed that he loved that woman, but that was not it
and then, to top off everything, katerina, the only servant of the doctor’s wife, had just the night before taken her poor mistress completely by surprise by announcing to her that she was going to have a baby before morning
i wasn’t really flogged
now i have reached the last twenty-four hours of my story, the closing scene of the final act
as i have already mentioned, he was just three when he lost his mother, yet he always remembered how she looked and how she caressed him—just as if she were standing alive before me, he would say
he turned away from nelyudov altogether, as if he had decided not even to address him
he looked incredibly worn out and exhausted
we’ll leave forever
here’s how i propose to end it, ivan said, continuing
but alyosha indignantly rejected the suggestion that mitya could have killed for the sake of the money, although he readily conceded that the three thousand rubles had become an obsession with him, that he regarded the sum as rightfully his, as part of his inheritance from his mother that his father had misappropriated, and that, while not in the least avaricious, mitya could not hear the three thousand mentioned without flying into a completely disproportionate rage
why do you say that?
a warm and kind smile appeared on his old lips; he became quite animated; his wariness and caution vanished; he seemed to have forgotten that he would been trying to be reserved
it could be rakitin, who, for some reason, has been going to see him very often lately
he just asked and nothing more
he started by asking alyosha when exactly the accused had told him about his hatred for his father and his intention to kill him, and whether he had repeated it again during their last meeting before the catastrophe
she whispered pathetically, pointing after him, and then she walked to the middle of the room and started declaiming: monsieur, monsieur, jamais un homme ne fut si cruel, si bismarck, que cet être, qui regarde une femme comme une saleté de hasard
besides, i wouldn’t know how to say it
it was obvious to me from the beginning that he had not come to my attic just to chat with me or to appease my mother's anxiety
tell me this: were you still putting it on when you were in the hospital too?
and that's why she needs a man to obey: she's a subservient creature by nature
i believed that unquestioningly and it was as though someone had lifted a horrible weight off my chest
no, i didn’t go home, mitya said with apparent calm, but still looking persistently at the floor
i see you looking over there—what would you like?
even without that, i know i won’t be admitted straight into the kingdom of heaven (the mountain not moving when i ask it to shows that they don’t believe very much in my faith up there, and so i can’t expect too great a reward when i get there), and so what good would it do me if, on top of that, i allowed those people to flay me alive without getting anything in return for my pains?
gentlemen, please forgive me for losing my temper again, but it’s just as i anticipated: the old hypocrite has lured us all here to take part in a disgraceful public scene
as to the guards outside, they did not care one way or the other as long as alyosha had permission from their superiors
suddenly i get a tremendous desire to say insulting things about god out loud and i begin to shout foul words
and then, just at this moment, there was another unexpected interruption
and that was why alyosha had not gone to see kolya as he had planned
he reproaches me with thinking that!
a clothes line, tied across the room between the stove and the window on the left, was hung with all sorts of ragged washing
he produced a ten-ruble bill and i handed him the album
grushenka had, however, succeeded in emancipating herself from him while instilling in him a limitless trust in her loyalty
one of their stones hurt you pretty badly, i believe, alyosha said
and let me tell you—for i don’t intend to hide anything from you now—he even spat at me
what a repulsive mug the man has, don’t you think?
but, after several such exclamations, he somehow forgot to make the point that, if an abominable man like the accused was capable of remembering with gratitude, for twenty-three years, the pound of nuts given to him by the only person who ever treated him with kindness while he lived in his father’s house, it stands to reason that this same accused could not have forgotten that twenty-three years ago he was running about loose in his father’s backyard, barefoot and with his trousers held up by one remaining button, as the kind dr herzenstube described the scene to us
my kinsman peter miusov would rather speeches contained plus de noblesse que de sincérité, whereas i prefer mine to have plus de sincérité que de noblesse, because i don’t give a damn about noblesse!
and so when i was asked you are a prince then?
as to his being a maniac, i would accept this notion, but only in one particular aspect—namely, when it comes to the three thousand rubles that his father allegedly still owed him, just as the medical experts pointed out
he came by train and was very angry
taisez-vous, je dormirai apres, he told her and left the room
and i am not guilty of robbing him—no, no, how could i be guilty of that?
i do not want any
the big, heavy pole asked him threateningly in russian
i simply want to tell you about a father meeting his beloved son for the first time, i started in as casual a tone as i could manage
yet somehow his dark brown, slightly grizzled hair, his black eyebrows, his big beard, and rather large eyes, instead of giving him character, seemed, on the contrary, to make him look commonplace and uninteresting
(versilov said that it was a heart attack)
i didn’t mention the other human tears with which our earth is soaked from crust to core, because i was deliberately narrowing the subject
but i’d like to wait here for a while first and find out what you decide about mr karamazov
she’s not yet sixteen and she’s already offering herself, he said scornfully, walking quickly on again
are you really so sure of that, my good baron?
but i want you to get out now, this very minute, and never come back
of course, for who knows, perhaps we will meet some day as good old friends and remember this scene with nice, jovial laughter?
mitya was in a sort of delirium
as i was passing the haymarket watchman's box, i felt an impulse to embrace the guardian of the peace!
i am sure arkady has something on his mind, so let him finish
his voice was like a stranger's
ivan asked, suddenly beginning to laugh
i don’t even want to be bothered with thinking about it!
instead of opening up the sky and painting all those angels, i will lower a bright ray down from the sky toward the boy, as if to meet him
and so, having understood that, he turns around and joins the
mitya told me she was screaming that i ought to be whipped
he’d never seen it himself and so, when he took it from under the mattress, he’d be likely to tear it open to check whether it really contained the money he was after and then just toss the envelope away, in too much of a rush to stop and think that the envelope could be used as evidence against him later, seeing as he’s no experienced thief
you do not mean it seriously, do you?
it is quite possible that the sight of the old man was more than he could bear at that moment, but such an overt display of hostility surprised even mr karamazov
the forester still treated the whole thing almost with scorn and, after he had opened the window, he just mumbled sullenly, it’s good enough like this, and went back to sleep, leaving mitya a lighted iron lantern
but listen to me, for heaven’s sake, perkhotin said, with marked impatience now
their grinning faces fell, although they were still not quite sure what kolya was driving at
for you hid the deck of cards i brought you, didn’t you?
as to the rivalry between the two ladies, as the prosecutor referred to grushenka and katerina, alyosha answered very evasively and even left a couple of questions unanswered altogether
but it was not miracles, it was justice that he craved above all!
and why did you take twenty-five rubles from him?
remember how sometimes we spent hours on end discussing bare statistics, such as how many schools we have and the prospects of education in our country; then we counted murders and other criminal offenses and tried to compare these figures with actual news items
i am not talking about myself, but about the russian idea
and that is supposed to prove that everything took place exactly according to the plan explained in the letter, so that it is a fatal and not a ridiculous letter
once i gave an onion away and here i am
it was worded differently, but this is its purport: you wanted to come into the world and you came empty-handed, with nothing but some vague promise of freedom, which, in their simple-mindedness and innate irresponsibility, men cannot even conceive and which they fear and dread, for there has never been anything more difficult for man and for human society to bear than freedom!
but you will come running to me all right
but what’s the difference—walk a quadrillion kilometers or lie there eternally?
since they are spiteful, i will be spiteful too; since they are heartless, i will also be heartless
i am absolutely convinced that my brother is innocent
you know, dmitry calls you the cherub
alyosha, my pet, i look at you and i can hardly believe you are here, in my house!
the real reason for his removal from petersburg was to try to prevent rumors being spread about his engagement to anna, to stifle them in the embryo, so to speak
and will you cry for me?
no, ivan, you said several times yourself that you were the murderer
and as to the ideas he may get into his head—well, i’ve always been of the opinion that the best way of handling the ordinary russian is to flog him: he’s a scoundrel and there’s no need to be sorry for him
i have got to know him very well: he's a gloomy and suspicious man, and, although deep down he may be very kind, he tends to see evil in just about everything—in that, however, he's very much like me
and he moved the boy to his house
alyosha stopped a couple of steps away from him, looking at him in surprise
when asked about the money fyodor karamazov had prepared for her, she said she had never seen it and had only heard from the murderer that there was an envelope with three thousand rubles in it
well, when lise saw you approaching the house, she let out a cry, became hysterical, and had her wheel-chair moved to that room there
you know, i’m surprised that some people can go through life without even wondering about these things
you will freeze to death, you drunken swine, you moron, you will freeze to death if you do not get up!
he was still under the impression that grushenka was really there, hiding somewhere in the house
but no, i left simply because i felt terribly depressed here and a moment came when it was more than i could bear
i would made up whole scenes in which i was dignified, proud, and a little sad, and i would hoped perhaps to meet prince v too and thus gain direct access to high society
stay right where you are!
the one on the sofa was sprawled out, smoking a pipe, a smallish, pudgy, broad-faced man, disapproving of something or other—that was mitya’s fleeting impression of him
of course, after their first meeting, versilov refused to believe that she was all that; indeed, he suspected just the opposite, namely, that she was a hypocrite and a jesuit
on the other hand, during that night, he was submerged by waves of a peculiar and degrading fear which, he felt, drained him of his physical strength
besides, you could have given her an iou or, even better, offered her the same security as you offered mr samsonov and mrs khokhlakov
the elder varsonofy did at times seem a little strange, the monk said, but many of the stories that are told about him are nonsense
anyway, if that’s how you feel, why are you going there yourself to make it up with ilyusha?
oh, i love the aspirations of my ardent young friends, trembling with eagerness to live!
but i remember that, before i was eight and before i had learned to read properly, i had a sort of spiritual experience
as i said, i was pleased about i do not know what
i see, and besides i told you to come here myself yesterday
obviously i could not be kind and understanding at such a moment
mitya shouted from his place
prove to us once and for all the brute that you are!
ivan asked, gnashing his teeth
when they returned to gregory, he told them to run at once to the police inspector’s house and inform him of what had happened
he would have been too preoccupied with self-preservation, and there is absolutely no doubt about that
nevertheless, after we would found a cab, mrs prutkov suddenly had a different idea
i am sorry but you will just have to take everything off
i decided that perhaps versilov wanted to use the occasion to make me meet his son, in fact, my brother
tell me, ivan, is there a god or not?
i have read practically nothing and i certainly have no literary bent
somehow this particular detail doubled the irritation that was already seething within ivan: why, the creature has taken to wearing glasses now, as well, he thought indignantly
i led a wild and drunken life, dmitry went on
i am frightened, she whispered
what concerned him above all was the image of his beloved elder, the image of the righteous man whom he had venerated to the point of adoration
this character was not only a secret agent—he was in charge of a whole team of secret agents which, in its way, made him a man of considerable influence
suddenly i became aware of the total silence
i asked her to forgive me, because i wanted to punish myself completely
that is why, i believe, when many people noticed the smell of decay coming from his dead body, so soon moreover (less than a day) after his death, they were delighted beyond all measure
it’s the same as for a pagan tartar: who could hold him responsible, even in heaven, mr gregory, for not having been born a christian, and who would want to punish him for that, since no one can strip two hides off the same ox?
and he lapsed into gloomy silence
if it hadn’t been for that same servant gregory, who looked after him almost like a nanny, and who had also aged considerably, karamazov might not even have survived
all right, all right
and why did i have to fall in love with him so irrevocably during that brief moment i would seen him as a child?
and now, my dear alexei, all my hopes lie with you—there’s no need to tell you that my whole life is in your hands
yes, right, that would suit him fine!
all that time a lively conference had been going on in hushed tones between the two interrogators
some claim that she was helped over it, others that it was a case of levitation
oh, he is a man of deep, deep scruples!
you’ll spoil the flowers!
shedding their silly tears, they will finally admit that he who created them rebels intended to mock them and no more
then we will go to zershikov's, sit down at opposite ends of the table, and try to win ten thousand
i understand very well, mr ivan, sir
prince sergei owes him twenty thousand
i saw a woman completely naked when i was thirteen, female nakedness in all its entirety, and since then i have felt quite disgusted
let me tell you, he’s not a man, that one, but a stubborn mule
and they didn’t get to know much more as time passed, not even after four years during which miss grushenka svetlov had attracted considerable interest by becoming the town’s acknowledged great beauty
it turns out, consequently, that society is not really protected by this method because, even if a dangerous member is cut off and put far away out of sight, immediately another criminal will appear in his place, and sometimes even two
probably he felt he would been humiliated and made ridiculous by a girl whose acceptance he would taken for granted
no, pardon, mon cher, he's something like  i remember—she told me something about an old man
besides, i’m not so sure that it was under the pillow
he’s still feeling very vague and confused in the head, but, without noticing what he is doing, he crosses the garden, walks over to the lighted windows, and hears from his master—who, of course, is very pleased to see him—what has just happened
we have talked enough—i have decided and that's that
the golden age is an aspiration completely beyond the reach of men, but it's one to which they have devoted all their energies, for which they have willingly died, in the name of which they have killed their prophets, and without which they have no wish to live and do not even know how to die!
cher, he whispered now in mad anxiety, trembling like a dry leaf in the autumn wind, tell me the whole truth, my dear boy—where are they planning to hide me away now?
even if everybody else becomes like that?
much of the blame for this must be laid at our door, because we have neglected them and failed to see the danger
that means it had taken place
well, you may be right at that
besides, in this first letter that dmitry had seen, the man’s arrival was only hinted at and the whole letter seemed very vague and high-flown, and was filled with sentimental clichés
and she—all her features now contorted—she was about to say something, but before she could utter a word, he suddenly regained his pride
obviously because i had sentenced myself to die at five the following morning
the privileged creature rejects that priceless gift, fails to appreciate it, does not even like it, sneers at it, and remains unmoved
i’m all for clever people
is there still time for me to make the seven o’clock train?
oh, she's certainly ready to pay the ransom!
but i had resolved to become a decent man for the rest of my life when i was struck down by this blow of fate
the accumulation must be continuous, without stopping for one single day
is it just some wild fantasy or is there a mistake in identity, a quid pro quo, by your grand inquisitor?
he thought in annoyance
some of the evidence from secondary witnesses, such as fenya and her mother, seemed to him quite sufficient, and as to perkhotin, dmitry’s drinking companions, and the employees of the plotnikov store, they seemed to make the case against dmitry quite overwhelming
anna had faced his first assaults with the utmost dignity (but that was before i came)
it was that time in mokroye
if someone spoke to him, he would just wave the man away without answering
i was in moscow
he liked to fill himself with tea
for heaven’s sake, lise, don’t carry on like that or it’ll really be the end of me
there was a feud between our ancestors
although it was through no fault of your own that you knew nothing about the lord when you were a small boy and, envying the pigs their feed, you stole some of it, for which you were beaten, because stealing is very wicked, now you have shed blood and must die
we must first of all decide whether this is just a clinical aberration or an ordinary phenomenon affecting many people
but snegirev had no idea that kolya krasotkin was also planning to come that day, although he had long been anxious that the boy whom his son seemed to miss so badly should come
please, alyosha, won’t you see me off?
but since money matters stubbornly stayed out of our conversation, i naturally became furious at my own stupidity and in my irritation i remember answering one of his questions that seemed to me really too flippant by expounding for his benefit my views on women, very heatedly and hardly stopping to take a breath
now i’m glad it ended the way it did, she said again with the same smile
how dare you shove your money at me!
what if it should turn out to be brain fever?
well, never mind, respectfully or not, what does it mean?
does that mean again that it’s always rewarding to talk to a clever man?
but let's get down to brass tacks
so what are we to believe?
even among the people now, individuals become isolated more and more often, turn into greedy thrifty peasants and village usurers
he says it’s different
but what’s all this talk about this not being the right moment, and what’s the message you’re expecting?
she said she would tried to run away, but they held onto her and would not let her go
all that irritated me
he did not look in the least offended; indeed, if anything, he seemed very pleased with himself
she was informed that he was well dressed, young, and very polite (we may add parenthetically that perkhotin was a rather handsome young man and was well aware of it himself)
then i saw she was trembling
versilov left and the prince saw him politely to the door
but you just come out and repeat things somebody happened to tell you
put it down, put that icon down, andrei
i had deliberately mentioned the shares, but i certainly had no intention of telling vasin about what sergei had confided to me in secret the day before
he added somewhat condescendingly, as though to encourage his hesitant visitor
you know, here we are laughing, but just think how the accused must feel about it
most likely, at that time he did not really know himself why he had come, not being quite sure what it was that was driving him: a peculiar yearning had arisen in his heart, drawing him irresistibly into a new, unknown, but by then inevitable course
he started wondering, for instance, why it was that when he had come into the summer house now, he had sat down without thinking in exactly the same spot as the day before, rather than anywhere else
and that is not all: how many of those strong enough to be among the chosen have already or will in the future take their mighty minds and ardent hearts away from you and give them to some other cause, in the end raising their free banner against you?
i knew that vasin was now working for a stock company and that he often used to bring work home with him
one by one, the other lodgers went back to their rooms, but i stayed at the landlady's for a long time
come, son, that’s enough, my boy, he said sympathetically
his soul will grow and will see how infinite is the mercy of god and how good men can be!
he still could not utter a word
i had no doubt about it
no, misha, his is a soul in turmoil
to cut a long story short, he controls sergei sufficiently, is now pressing him so hard, and has made him lose his sense of honor to such an extent that he's looking for a way out of his difficulties by marrying anna, because neither of them can see any other way of getting the money
they would just come in from their faro room where, as i learned later, they would lost every last kopek they had on them
but she too must have been alive once, must not she?
in my thoughts,  the doctor told me, i often visualize ecstatically the sacrifices i could make for mankind and, indeed, i might even accept martyrdom for my fellow men if circumstances suddenly demanded it of me
in general, rakitin’s account seduced the public through the independence of its ideas and the loftiness of its vision
so now we must first find out if he really means to buy the lumber and pay eleven thousand rubles for it or if it’s just one of his lies
well, i guess i’ll have to bring perezvon into this too
the prosecutor and the examining magistrate were very much impressed by this testimony about the sixth thousand
her husband came up to me too and then they all surrounded me, almost hugging and kissing me
now karamazov started to look at him again with different eyes
his wound, although not fatal, still turned out to be grave enough for him to have to stay in bed for a long time
they have no bread, and they’re going about begging for their poor, burnt-out village
well, never mind, take the hanky too, it's clean and you can use it
what do you know about it?
old as it was, it seemed solid enough to last many years, and the inside was spacious and comfortable
but what work could she hope to find around afimievsk except on the cotton mill grounds?
but i was annoyed and ordered that you not be allowed into the house
no, but i want one with vanilla, you know—it’s specially good for little old men, he-he-he
she looked at me and then sat down
possibly she had once been an actress, the way she went in for that absurd declaiming and gesturing, per-forming ceaselessly, while now i kept silent
but throughout his later life he considered it loathsome that he had listened like that and, deep down in the mysterious recesses of his soul, he knew it was the most despicable thing he had ever done in his life
besides, there would have been a point if stepanov had been hurt by me, but since he would already been rehabilitated by the officers of his regiment without my help it was quite unnecessary
the prosecutor immediately asked mitya where he had expected to get the twenty-three hundred rubles he had promised the poles on his honor when, according to his present statement, he had only fifteen hundred rubles in the first place
wait,  i call out to him
isn’t that suffering, tell me?
whether i am base or noble makes no difference since you are, in either case, as inaccessible as the sun!
now that, for the first time in my life, i have acted sincerely, you all look upon me as if i were one of god’s fools and, although you like me, you still laugh at me
he cried, turning red
while he's in the rut, everything is clear: income, rank, position in society, horse and carriage, wife, etc
god will punish you, alyosha said, watching her closely
but in the big room the party went on again, louder than ever
he was obviously annoyed at my interruption
for i wouldn’t be here if i were not aware that your interest in her was fatherly, sir
of the common people, very few came into the cell, although many gathered at the gates of the hermitage
i shouted across the table to a gray-headed, mustachioed, purple-faced gentleman in long tails, who had been placing small sums for hours with unwavering patience and losing stake alter stake
if i said something that offended you, please forgive me because, i assure you, i have many more important things on my mind
and since he and i are the only ones in the whole world to know about these signals, it’s absolutely certain that the master will open the door as soon as he hears the knocks, without asking, who’s there?
oh, i know so well that wild heart—wild, yes, but also noble and generous!
early that morning, perhaps at eight or so, she would arrived at my—i mean my landlord's—apartment, hoping that the old prince would still be there
we are even told the words he mutters as he does so
this is typical of the way russian people believe, isn’t it?
is that what you’re suggesting?
hey, pane, mitya called out to him, let’s have a drink together
i was almost thinking
people could now stand up, stretch their legs, have a snack at the buffet, exchange impressions
now semyon is really vicious and he will corrupt them completely, whereas, as long as they were working for me, i always insisted that they behave
it must have taken him a long time to get even that far, for he had certainly fainted several times as he crawled, then had regained consciousness and crawled further
my former life is over and a new life is just beginning
i will certainly be very glad to do so!
he’s the one who makes me laugh!
whenever i’ve sunk into the deepest shame of depravity—and that has happened to me more often than anything else—i’ve always recited that poem about the goddess ceres and man’s fate
you know, i begin to think that you have no one in the world but me
nevertheless, i’m extremely fond of one of those russian boys
he started from the point when the accused went to the lady’s house with the intention of giving her a beating (the prosecutor said he was using the accused’s own words), but, instead of hitting her, he remained at her feet, and that was the beginning of his love
so it was with a heavy heart that he awaited the day
she’s gone to mokroye, sir, to that officer of hers
i remember how, after having completed the installations, zverev had patted the sofa tenderly and said to me:
indeed, the purer they are, the more forbidden is the subject
alyosha, who had never seen them before, did not know what the financial arrangements were
at the top of his voice
i may also add here the thought that flashed through my head while i was listening to him: i assumed that he loved mother with the abstract, humanitarian love that one feels for mankind as a whole rather than with the simple love that a man must feel for a woman; so that the moment he met a woman for whom he felt that simple love, he refused to recognize it, probably partly from lack of experience
and this is just the point: the constant frantic irritation of the accused was not actually caused by the three thousand rubles; something else triggered his anger
'why, you did not expect that you would stay for the reception and the dance,  she kept hissing at me in the carriage, 'and it's because of you that i could not stay myself
this is borne out by medical experience
as to the stars, not only have they all been counted, but all their movements have been calculated with an accuracy down to the last second so that it's possible to predict, say, a thousand years ahead the exact day and time of the appearance of a comet
i say one dozen will be plenty!
i even heard you tell her to her face that you loved her
of course, those words had escaped ivan involuntarily, when he was irritated
later, when his father died, lambert left the school, and i had not seen him for two years when i met him in the street one day
he also remembered that when someone had once asked him, why do you hate so-and-so so much?
well, that was my answer
it was quite impossible to trip him up
look, you didn’t get it out from under your nails properly; and now rub your face—right here
touchard had suddenly decided that he was not charging enough for me and wrote in a dignified tone that he had sons of princes and senators in his establishment, that it lowered the tone of the school to keep a boy with a family background like mine, and that unless he received an additional—
he seemed to be very afraid of something and i suddenly noticed that his hands were trembling
first of all, according to the experts, the institution of elder came into existence in our russian monasteries only quite recently, less than a hundred years ago, although it has existed for well over a thousand years throughout the orthodox east, particularly in sinai and on mount athos
you see, mr karamazov, nelyudov went on, we’ve done everything within our power to help you clear yourself
after he had heard mr karamazov’s command, shouted at him from the carriage as it was pulling away from the monastery, alyosha stood for a while looking quite lost
i never even noticed i was covered with blood, mitya said
have mercy upon them all, o lord
but, my god, now i’m sorry i ever set eyes on that sheet; i never expected it would carry that sort of rumor!
you know, lise, it’s horribly painful for a man down on his luck when every person he meets looks at him as if he were his benefactor
you see what kind of a man he is, miusov said, turning to the monk
why is it her duty?
i hope you do not mind my frankness
and although versilov did use such adjectives as petty and selfish about himself, there was still something haughty in his apology, something suggesting a scornful casualness toward the whole business
why, if i miss this opportunity, i will never find the answer in all my life
i don’t think anyone did
what i’m trying to say is that you so often get involved with all kinds of people, like that other time, with that captain
i see you are here, he said, while i have been to your place looking for you
mitya listened attentively, asking him to repeat various things, and was pleased
in fact, i’m terribly sad to lose you
my god, and here i am sitting on his lap!
he burst out laughing
but is he sincere?
at that time the convalescing old prince had shown a propensity to spend money at an alarming rate, almost to scatter it to the winds
fenya, did they send that girl again with the letter?
you can’t pass by me like that; you must know there’s something that we two clever people have to discuss
i’ve seen his picture
i am just reporting this fact without comment
i’d give the world for a minute like this one
the luncheon can’t have even taken place!
i suddenly burst out laughing, apologized to them, and, turning to mrs prutkov, added with easy familiarity: all right, ma'am, i take back my statement that you are the bane of my existence
he said, suddenly stopping in the doorway
maria, who told me all this in moscow, believed both versions
he’s suddenly started telling me about that katya woman: she’s so great and so marvelous and this and that, and she’s sent for a doctor from moscow and engaged the most eminent and learned lawyer, the very best there is, to save him, mitya
stebelkov said it was you
you frightened me, that’s what you did, rakitin, grushenka said, and then looked smilingly at alyosha
now, if ivan loved him too, i’d be afraid for my life
alyosha asked in alarm
but there is, alas, another version—one, indeed, that kraft accepted, that i had heard before, and that i believed to be true too
there are three forces, only three, on this earth that can overcome and capture once and for all the conscience of these feeble, undisciplined creatures, so as to give them happiness
you can get one like that at a jeweler's for sixteen rubles
but it ca not be done, you little idiot; it's impossible now, and that's just the trouble
katerina has never loved me
what does that mean—you cannot accept his world?
alyosha, please don’t despise me for this, and if it is really an awful thing to do and if it annoys you very much, forgive me please
anyway, yesterday i proposed to you and i beg you to forgive me for that
on the bed on the left was a heap of pillows in black calico cases, each smaller than the next
i’m very worried—she’s still unconscious
not directly, alyosha said
i don’t want to set eyes on our house anymore or on our things, i don’t want to see any of it again
paisii watched him intently
but no one would have been able to establish any motive, for everybody knew that he was liked by his master and felt honored by the trust his master had in him
vasin's face did not really strike me particularly, although he had the reputation of being a remarkably intelligent man
he didn’t like leaving her in that state, but he was in a hurry
the sudden change in her took place literally in a flash and it completely stunned alyosha
ah, so here you are, at last!
ivan shouted, banging his fist on the table
but i want you to know that all the time i was carrying that money on me, i kept saying to myself, no, dmitry karamazov, you may still prove that you’re not really a thief!
yes, that’s true, absolutely true, and although i tried to win him over by my love, my limitless love—i was even willing to forgive him his betrayal—he didn’t understand anything at all!
every time i entered a new school or met people who, being my elders, had to be treated with respect—and that means every lousy teacher, every tutor, every village priest—every single one of them would, upon asking my name and being told it was dolgoruky, for some reason invariably add: prince dolgoruky?
so she took me by the hand, led me away, washed my face and hands, made me change my underwear and my shirt, pomaded and even curled my hair
ivan asked gruffly in a stern voice, trying hard to keep himself under control and suddenly realizing with enormous self-disgust that he was immediately curious to know how he could have displeased this flunkey and that he would not move away before he had satisfied his curiosity
but even supposing they may be right from their ignoble point of view, even so who of them would dare to condemn me?
if you have heard him talk, you must know him, you must!
then i told him straight out that i would heard the big news and that i was very happy for him
even toward the end of zosima’s life, there were monks who hated and envied him, but there were fewer and fewer of them, and they kept their feelings to themselves, although some occupied important positions in the monastery
prince, anna said, raising her voice, now you are insulting me and allowing these people to insult me!
she was terribly excited
no, no, that's not what i meant
all dressed up, mitya thought
did you really think about me too?
well, not really, but still
yes, i concede, it may be a triumph of vulgarity, require no talent, and suit a mediocrity, but there can hardly be any impotence in this case
now i can feel your eyes on me and i know that it's my son who's looking at me
we are preserving the image of christ—may that image shine like a precious diamond over the world
in fact, i will do what i can to— but tell me, what about you?
until thirty, though, it’s all right
can it really be true that you came only for the chosen few?
well, there's nothing so special about the scene, nothing much to it really, but you will never forget it as long as you live, and it has survived throughout the whole of europe
blessed is the man who has his own ideal of beauty, even if it be a wrong ideal!
oh, tell me about that too, tell me about mother!
in russia he would already been involved in a scandal—something to do with forgery of shares
yes, precisely for you, rakitin said with a grin
a cold and sickly sweat broke out on his forehead and on his temples
about six months before he was to die (he was already seventeen at the time) he started visiting a man who led a very isolated life in our town, a man who had been exiled from moscow for what amounted to free-thinking
he roared madly, drawing himself up in his chair as though preparing to pounce on me
i don’t see, though, why it should concern you
didn’t you often tell them then that you wanted to make them free
i remember you up to the age of eleven
after their mother’s death, the fate of the two little boys was a repetition of their older brother mitya’s
he pushed me
besides, i think he’s sick now
but they were part of something continuous, of a greater whole, of something solid and very satisfying
fenya, bring some pies, too, and see that they’re hot
he didn’t answer and was ready to burst into tears
(with less than a rothschild-size fortune, however, i realize it would be very difficult to do)
and, as usual, he was ready with his answer and delivered it in his calm, restrained tone, while the expression on his face seemed to say, all right, if you want to bring it out in the open, i’ll meet you there too!
but they only laughed
otherwise every man thinks he can do everything and wants to astonish the whole world and i would be the worst of them all perhaps if i had the skill to do it
i could not face that and so finally i managed to muster up enough courage—or perhaps despair—to do what i have now done
your mummy may be here before me, because it’s high time she was back too
the papa is delighted that the twigs he uses to flog the child have knots in them
i don’t suppose one little glass will kill me
how am i to understand that?
look at the worldly, at those who set themselves above the people of god—have they not distorted the image of god and his truth?
he kept silent, wouldn’t talk to me
otherwise, for instance, you could have put an end to that terrible torment, which lasted almost a month, by returning the fifteen hundred rubles to the person who had entrusted you with the money, and then, having explained to her the terrible situation you were in, as you described it to us, you could have done the most natural thing, that would occur to anyone—namely, after having acknowledged your mistake, to ask her to lend you that same sum
i have the documents to prove it!
andrei shouted, pointing ahead with his whip
i would appreciate it if you would never make me such an offer again, i cut in
plastunov glanced worriedly at dmitry but obeyed at once
she’s getting what she deserves
along two of the walls were beds covered with knitted blankets
how can their being in hell put things right?
the policeman, apparently a reasonable man with a distaste for street incidents caused by citizens' irritability, seemed to be on his side, at least to some extent
in fact, they consist largely of formalized reports of very commonplace interest, along with the most impersonal expression of feelings, if one can express feelings at all that way
i made a mistake in thinking that even a man like fyodor karamazov would understand his obligations when received by a highly respectable person
but when the author dares to declare that the foundations he mentions—some of which were noted by father joseph a few moments ago—are natural, immutable, and eternal, he thereby goes directly against the church and its sacred mission, preordained from time immemorial
do not be like that, my friends, for you do not really think i am afraid to die, do you?
what can you like me for?
i would even fixed the day when i would leave
but the right word for it, i think, is stolen
his impatience boiled up in him and suddenly he made up his mind
explain it to me once more
but he never reforms—again, i am probably just the same in that respect
that, i remember, mother said
now he gets offended at being asked such a trivial question and becomes genuinely angry
it would have cost you nothing to do it that way
but nelyudov returned with a man who handed mitya some strange clothes
she sees the sinners being tortured
but what it really amounts to is that you’re angry with your god today—it’s as though there had been unfair discrimination and the right man had not got his promotion or his name was left off the new year’s list of honors
tatyana growled, and then, pointing at me, she said to makar: how did you find him, my dear man?
but never mind, i do not give a damn about you
but after the governor was gone, lizaveta was again to be seen around town wearing nothing but her smock, just as before
that’s exactly what it was!
can you explain now?
it was said—and andronikov is supposed to have heard this from katerina's own mouth—that, when he had learned of the young girl's feelings for him, versilov himself had offered his love to the stepmother
i hated you as though you were the cause of it all, as though everything had happened through your fault
in the second place, i also will not speak of adults at the moment, because, besides being disgusting and undeserving of love, they have something to compensate them for their suffering: they have eaten their apple of knowledge, they know about good and evil and are like gods themselves
of course, i am
i am sorry to disappoint the reader straightaway, sorry, but at the same time i feel like laughing
but the gentle father joseph’s words were wasted on them and even met with sarcastic rejoinders
he may be right—you’ve lost enough as is, grushenka said with a peculiar intonation in her voice
gives the insects sensual lust,
you know, i like him very much at times
let me note too that, after her first surprise and curiosity about makar's presence in the house, lisa somehow began to treat him almost condescendingly, i might even say scornfully
i was placing my stakes, standing behind the table
of course, the police and the legal authorities could not ignore the confession altogether and had to start a criminal investigation, but it was soon dropped on the grounds that even if the evidence presented—the letters and other articles—could be proved authentic, it would still not be sufficient for a conviction
nelyudov asked with gentle insistence
here is what i have been thinking about and what i have decided: if i were to escape, and even if it were with money and a passport, and i managed to get as far away as america, what cheers me is the thought that what i’d find there would not be joy and happiness, but something that might be even worse than hard labor in siberia
but if you don’t forgive me, it won’t really make much difference now, because nothing really makes any difference anymore
on top of everything, both his hands were caked with blood
at first he seemed grateful, but then he cheered up and became genuinely amused
he really had to keep his ears open now
but the door was closed, there were people with you, discussing business matters
well, he kept it all right
it was they who attacked me and who used abusive language, much worse than anything i used: they said i was a nasty little brat and that i ought to be sent to bed without dinner that night; also that i was a nihilist, that they would call the police, that i was pestering them because they were weak, helpless women but that if there had been a man with them, i would have immediately put my tail between my legs like a puppy who would been spanked
i still remember how impressed i was by how gorgeously she was dressed in green silk
i found you sincere
as he was praying now, he chanced to feel in his pocket the little envelope that the maid had given him after he had left katerina’s house
i want to get completely drunk, just like the time we got to know each other, mitya, remember?
as soon as he recovered and could answer our questions, he declared most categorically that when he walked out onto the porch of the servants’ cottage, he heard a noise and decided to enter the garden through the gate, which had been left unlocked
as i walked in, i tried hard to control myself
the prosecutor then described in great detail mitya’s efforts to obtain the money he needed and thus avoid killing his father
he presented the whole tragedy of the accused and of the crime as a product of outdated mores surviving from the days of serfdom and of the chaos prevailing in russia because of the lack of proper social organization and adequate public services
i spat in pan mitya’s face
fyodor karamazov immediately busied himself with preparations for the journey to petersburg, and perhaps he would have gone, although he certainly had no idea what he would do there
who put this pillow under my head?
no one at all, ever
but our father has no wish to tear the cup from his lips
about once a week she went home, that is, to the house of her late father’s employers, and in cold winters she went there to sleep almost every night, either in the entrance hall or in the cowshed
also, no doubt, out of sheer enthusiasm
so the case is going to be heard today, is it!
it was just after one
and so on and so forth
our conversation did not last long and he soon started promising me money, a goodly sum, a goodly sum, just for your cooperation, just so that you see to it that prince sergei goes to see prince nikolai
then god will send you happiness
take that white one out of his hand and give it to me!
he was praying fervently, whispering wildly to himself:
but i prayed very quickly since i was in a great hurry
ivan saw at once from smerdyakov’s appearance that he had completely recovered from his illness: his face was much fresher and fuller, his forelock was carefully brushed up in the middle of his forehead, as in the old days, and the hair at his temples was neatly combed back
so you imagine i will accept money from him?
i would found out about their situation while i was still in moscow, but i never expected things to be that bad
he simply must have got a bit mixed up
what makes me furious is that versilov never bothers to correct you when you refer to people so humbly, because he's so full of himself und cares nothing about any of us
mother is sitting by his bed
i thought they must be other lodgers
i said, pointing at the poor old man
he was very pleased with himself as he uttered the final words of his speech
do not be offended if people treat you badly
cher enfant, i always felt that one way or another we would get to understand each other some day
and then one day, in a restaurant in the presence of several army officers, he suddenly declares: i have decided to have pheasant
i asked for a corner with just enough room to turn round in and they told me scornfully that if that's what i was looking for i would have a better chance in a flophouse
suicide is man's greatest sin, he said with a sigh, but god alone can judge it, for only god knows what and how much a man can bear
those were the thoughts going through my head as i sat in that tavern
he stopped visiting her house, but then one night, taking advantage of his familiarity with the layout of the place, he entered the house through the garden and by the roof, with reckless disregard for the risk of being caught
a double on the seven!
he walks to the door, opens it, and says to him, go now, and do not come back
true, there was a dominant feeling among these that exerted tremendous pressure on me in propelling me in one direction
but why is it only a very ordinary sin’?
that's the kind of business i own
in the meantime, however, consider this: we have perhaps several dozen witnesses to testify that you yourself went around telling people, even shouting from the roof-tops, that you’d gone through three thousand rubles on that spree, and it was always three thousand, never fifteen hundred
god bless you, little man, grow and be happy, dear childl
did you know that that no-good dmitry wants to marry her?
he says it to prepare me for what is to come
as we parted, vasin thanked me once more
you want to know how i managed to get hold of all this information?
and if you are not, i’ll have to jump in the lake this very day
i can see by your face that now you are being sincere again
i do not doubt now that there is such a thing as fate!
and that’s how the best, the nicest of them, act!
he said this aloud and all of a sudden dashed to the fence, climbed over it, and started to run
knowing he was an illegitimate son of fyodor karamazov—and we have evidence that he knew it—smerdyakov was bitter about his position as compared with that of fyodor karamazov’s legitimate sons, who, he felt, had everything while he had nothing, who would inherit their father’s money while he, smerdyakov, was doomed to remain a cook all his life
but what this shameful and distasteful feeling within me was, i could not explain
smerdyakov killed him on my instructions
and how often have i blamed myself for nothing!
he was, in fact, quite furious with himself all the way to the lady’s house, but he repeated to himself about ten times: i’ll go through with it, happen what may!
n'est-ce pas, cher enfant?
'if you are interested, come over and we will discuss it
a little way before he reached maria kondratiev’s house, ivan met a short peasant wearing a warm but patched coat, who was zigzagging drunkenly, grumbling and swearing
however, the otherwise weak-willed old man, with whom one could do anything, now categorically refused to break his promise to marry anna, who actually had taken the initiative of proposing to him
be generous, o man!
so you will move it away, will you?
besides, he has plenty of time to change his mind and, by then, ivan will have recovered and will take charge of everything, and i’ll be out of it altogether
he seems to be a very respectable fellow
i saw a lap-dog just like this one when i was in the army, mitya said dreamily, only one of its hind legs had been broken
one more important point: was versilov aware of what was afoot at that time?
my reasoning went like this: the letter about the inheritance that i had in my possession was a matter of conscience; by entrusting to vasin's judgment the decision as to what i should do about it, i was showing him how deeply i respected him, which was bound to flatter him
in brief, he hopes and intends to make amends for everything, begs you for your blessing, and beseeches you to forget what has happened
what an inspired idea!
go away, leave me, all of you, and i hope i never see you again
i took the money out of my pocket and held it out to her
but what if, in reality, things were entirely different, and what if the accused is not at all like the character in the novel made up by the prosecutor?
and the second thing i must tell you is that i won’t try to worm any secret out of him; if he tells me of his own accord, i’ll tell him that i’ve promised to tell you about it, and then i’ll come here and tell you
when i come from a visit to you, i feel purified and it makes me feel a better person than i really am
allow me to have this written down, the prosecutor said
once, when they were abroad and she was in a laughing mood, she did say to sergei that perhaps, in the future, who knows
when father varsonofy died, not only was there no smell of decay, there was even a decided aroma of flowers from his body, they repeated with malicious insistence, but it was not because he had been an elder that he deserved it, but because he was a righteous man
you were literally swaying so that i thought you were on the verge of fainting
all right, i won’t go into it either, but i will allow myself to remark that if a person as respectable and honorable as miss verkhovtsev suddenly decides to change her testimony, as she did with the obvious intention of ruining the accused, she cannot be considered a cool, impartial, and detached witness
father paisii raised his eyes from the gospels and glanced at alyosha, but then he quickly lowered them to his book again, realizing that something strange was happening to the youth
and after that, he came to see me almost every evening
can a spider hate the fly he's preparing to snare?
to that i answer that precisely the fact that, with what they found on him, they could only account for fifteen hundred rubles, not for the three thousand he was supposed to have stolen, suggests that the money had come from somewhere else, that it had never been sealed in that envelope
but tell me, do you really belong to that group?
i was waiting—i thought you’d call me
i would like to whip those orphans!
he must be thinking i’m trying hard to get his approval, kolya decided
i was waiting for you anxiously today, you, lisa's brother, so i could tell you everything she does not know: i am a common criminal, for i have taken part in the forgery of    railway shares
mitya nodded his head, repeating in an undertone to his counsel, all right, all right, i won’t do it again
mikhail rakitin came in and he showed me a short poem he’d written about my sore foot
but however much you may disapprove, my dear karl von moor, i’m still determined to take alyosha out of the monastery, he announced
then the baiting by the boys would start all over again
all right then, look at it now and you will see that scientists will soon explain all the mysteries of god without leaving a single one to you and me
and i am magnanimous
that's always how it is when the heart is too full
the boy cried nervously
i remember one of my teachers commenting that i was filled with the justified resentment of a citizen whose civil rights had been violated, but he was the only one of that opinion
i set off for home
he thinks that will make ilyusha feel better, but i doubt it
he had told me three days before about the idea of an escape and, for the three days that followed, we kept quarreling
he said, baring his teeth in a grin
a thick coil of dark brown hair suddenly escaped from under her cap and slipped onto her shoulder, but she paid no attention to it and made no attempt to put it back in place; she gazed intently at her visitors until she made out who they were
for the once in i do not know how many weeks that i come here to dinner, it's just my luck to find lisa in such a gloomy mood!
but what did it all come to?
being a well-bred and sincerely decent man, miusov underwent a rapid process of self-examination, as he entered the father superior’s rooms with ivan, as a result of which he grew ashamed of having lost his temper
i’ve just come to town,  he says, and i want to thank you now for the pound of nuts you once gave me, because you’re the only person who has ever given me a pound of nuts in my whole life!
so, then, you wo not interfere, will you?
on the other hand, from other sources, i know that versilov had a tremendous influence on katerina at first and that their relations deteriorated gradually until they reached the final breaking point
also there were expensive rugs, carved wood, and pieces of sculpture
when i left dergachev's—god knows why i went there at all—i latched onto vasin and started praising him in an outburst of enthusiasm
if only you people knew how important it is to me—i’m really getting desperate!
i admit such offers have been made me, but i turned them down
i leaped to my feet
as he remembered it later, he sat there quite terrified during that first second, while smerdyakov stood in front of him, his hands behind his back, looking at him with complete self-assurance, indeed with a certain sternness
they go so far as to declare in print—i have read such statements myself—that they can no longer interpret the holy scriptures to people because they are so poor and that if lutherans or heretics come to take their flocks away from them—then, let them, for we are not properly paid
i could not help reproaching myself a little for what seemed to me now the smugness and even condescension with which i would listened the night before to certain passages of his confession
and he grabbed me by the arm
those words of yours, balaam’s ass, are worth their weight in gold, and i’ll see to it that you get a gold piece today
so let’s drink to life, brother, for what can be more precious than life?
ah, what fool i am to have shed so many tears during these five years, a shameless fool
how, how could he have just dismissed him from his mind?
ivan said in surprise and suddenly felt a real wave of fear creep up his spine
and i sometimes wondered whether he did not come to see me simply because he had no one else to talk to
it had snowed lightly during the night and a sharp, dry wind was raising a snowy powder and sweeping it along the town’s bleak streets and all across market square
mitya noticed this and shuddered
you don’t understand, do you?
i wound up my lengthy tirade rather incoherently
after all, how could he know, when he was trampling the bills, that i’d bring them back to him again the next day?
he could listen with the tender attention of a woman
lambert's voice was very loud
of course, i was aware of it
just before reaching it, he remembered his father’s insistence that he slip into the house unseen by ivan
you have enough money of your own now and they’ll say you just took it out of your cashbox
i have enough will power to stop whenever i decide
i heard he was on his way, but isn’t he still pretty far away?
for god’s sake, man, this is no joke, understand!
i am not sure, however, whether his intelligence is really
perhaps i was completely wrong when i decided to write this: there's so much more left inside me beyond what comes out in words
trust to what your heart will tell you,
at three o'clock i suddenly came to my senses
we are too vicious, my good woman, both of us, and we’re both past the niceties of forgiveness
isn’t that the truth?
i definitely decided to go straight back and give versilov the letter about the inheritance without any explanation; i would pack my belongings in my suitcase, make a bundle out of the rest, and move to a hotel for the night
please believe me
if you would only listen to me for half a minute, madam, i’d explain everything to you, perkhotin said firmly
but what i said is the truth, you understand, the truth!
listen, that landlord, whatever his name is, is not he a doctor?
you’ve got it right, father paisii said
i was sitting in an armchair while he walked up and down the room
i’ll explain it to you later
all that's just blabber
arkady darling, go and catch him!
and ilyusha’s bed is still there
people are more and more moved by envy now, by the desire to satisfy their material greed, and by vanity
the three thousand that you promised
before that, he was quite gay and cheerful
i am sure you wo not understand what i mean, lambert, when i tell you that i will listen to your proposition because of my 'breadth,  i declared in a steady voice, and he at once filled up my glass
she added with indignation, looking at him challengingly
this seemed most unlikely to me
alyosha did not answer
you must remember that
you know what, i have some salami in my pocket, which i picked up in town just in case i got hungry on my way here
no, wait, you would better not drink any more
the little pole began, turning to grushenka, his face crimson with anger
but he bent down and kissed me on the cheek
well, after all, let's say that i am his son, although my name is dolgoruky, but that's because i am illegitimate
i think we’ve lost touch with the people—that’s an axiom of mine
look, ilyusha, mr krasotkin has come to see you
he died last night, and imagine
i don’t trust them
there was one story especially, about how he’d cured a paralyzed lady: if my legs didn’t ache so,  he says, i’d show you a dance you’ve never seen before
i’m perfectly capable of answering your questions!
if he had sufficient scruples to worry that someone might be blamed for his own death, did he then run out of scruples so completely as to allow an innocent man to be blamed for the death of his former master?
i respect your brother!
i shouted, as though i would suddenly discovered the answer to everything
and ask him whether he likes bath-house back-scrubbers, tousled ones
please, prince, have your tea, and if you would allow me, i would like to have a cup with you
he was a tall, spare man with very long, lean legs and very long, pale fingers
and as you learn to love them more and more, you will be more and more convinced of the existence of god and of the immortality of your soul
they had a complete explanation and, whatever speculation there may have been on that subject, it's all finished now!
so this is my whole idea, for the rest is just details
the other is very ill, and his life is in danger
and it turned out that they did because:
ivan all of a sudden became very angry
i’m on the bottom rung while you’re much higher up, perhaps on the thirteenth rung
i tell you, the old doctor who could cure you of every illness has all but vanished and you find nothing but specialists these days, and they even advertise in the newspapers
and what about a drink?
i greatly appreciate your willingness to cooperate
after spending nine days totally unconscious, i came back to myself quite regenerated but not at all reformed
it wasn’t sorrow, it was human happiness that christ extolled, and the first miracle he worked was to bring men happiness
tomorrow, i’ll try to raise the money from everyone i can think of, but if i can’t get it from them, i give you my word i’ll go to see my father, smash his head in, and take the money from under his pillow, provided only that ivan has left by then
well, i admit he pulled it off quite effectively
i understood that, but the trouble was that lambert finally understood it too
i don’t know whether you are, misha, but i certainly am not
alyosha hesitated for a second
tell me this now: is it the same sokolsky that versilov is having that lawsuit with about the inheritance?
in short, mitya was told that, from then on, he was a prisoner and would be taken at once to town to be locked up in a rather unpleasant establishment
the question of whether this was miraculous healing or natural recovery never even occurred to alyosha, for he had complete faith in the spiritual power of his teacher, whose glory he felt as his own personal triumph
from there, i went to mother's, both to see her and in the hope of finding mrs prutkov there
intelligence is crooked, while stupidity is honest
the audience was excited, electrified by the scenes and the outbursts that had just taken place, and they were anxiously awaiting the conclusion of the show—the summations of the prosecutor and the defense counsel, and then the verdict
so i would let society distribute my wealth, while i myself would melt into the crowd and dissolve into mediocrity once more!
the prince bared his teeth in a grin
he was one of the prominent personalities of our town
i certainly never expected to talk to you again
i have used the phrase devote myself to my idea because it expresses my main purpose in life
another of the daughters of this former peasant was married to some pen-pusher who had worked his way up to become a petty government official; and now, in one of the rooms of the guest house, one could see among the family photographs exhibited on the wall a picture of the official in his dress uniform, epaulets and all
i have no wish to insult you because you look like an honest woman, and i suppose that's your daughter over there
his heart contracted painfully
i’m sure that, if it hadn’t been for all these little obstacles, we would have already come to an understanding
but i came to my senses and refused to serve a mad cause
turn them into loaves of bread and men will follow you like cattle, grateful and docile, although constantly fearful lest you withdraw your hand and they lose your loaves
it's very hard to understand what actually makes people laugh
it's such an ungrateful task, and it can have no beauty of form
and suddenly i saw my whole situation in its true light: what was i about to do now?
i suppose if you get unbearably bored you could perhaps try loving someone or even just getting attached to something or other
o lord, have you not performed miracles to save sinners as bad as me before?
of his jealousy, mitya spoke excitedly and at great length and, although he felt inwardly that it was rather humiliating to expose his intimate feelings to public scrutiny, he overcame his reluctance in order to make his account as true as possible
after a brief conference among the judges, they ordered that ivan’s testimony, as well as katerina’s unscheduled additional evidence, be entered in the record and that the trial be resumed
no one knows about this letter
when they called him in, kalganov complied reluctantly, looked sullen and peevish, and spoke to the prosecutor and the examining magistrate as if he were seeing them for the first time in his life, although in fact they were old acquaintances whom he met almost every day
i believed he’d love me, unclean as i am, love me truly, not just like an animal
the mere fact that he is a papa (and not necessarily a german papa) —that he has a family, that he lives like everybody else, that he has expenses and obligations like any other man—is enough to make it impossible for him to become a rothschild and dooms him to mediocrity
it was when he was waiting so impatiently for mother to arrive that katerina akhmakov appeared on the scene
there will be no trace of my disgrace left anywhere, except in my heart, where the scars will remain forever
well, we will see how suitable he turns out to be
if he hadn’t killed him, i wouldn’t have dared to take the money, of course, and it would have stayed where it was
an attendant hurried up to dmitry
take it—ta-ake it for heaven's sake
if he didn’t write such things, i understand he said them
indeed, you’ll come hurrying all the way from siberia to see me, to share some of your happiness with me!
of course, you may not be telling me the truth to make it easier for me because you have such marvelous manners
so you go to paris
it's even vexing, is not it?
and the other one—the little, good-looking fellow—he's the son of a general, but his family is ashamed of him and i was the one who got him off the hook when he was arrested
obviously, i am very surprised, indeed, quite stunned
all right, so go and get married, but i still say you are a little twerp and you have a long way to go before you are a man
and, you know, he used to wear chains
i will bring him here, lambert
and my soul will remain completely my own
i examined the envelope hoping to find some penciled note, some sign, but found nothing
the fact that maria, who was, i suppose, in her way a sort of romantic and who had been entrusted with the document, had decided to give the letter to me was, on her part, a decision based on reasons that i do not feel it necessary to explain here, although i may later if i see a point to it
the father was terribly happy when we came
kolya then picked up the cannon from the floor and presented it to ilyusha, together with the supply of powder and the shot
katerina rose from her seat, staring at ivan in horror
he said, holding it up for everyone to see
i cannot remember in proper order what happened then, because i myself was terribly agitated and was in no state to observe developments properly
she suddenly lifted her frail little hand and, with breathtaking dexterity, delivered a resounding slap on my companion's face
he asked the teacher
he got down and walked into the yard
when he spoke to people now, he used only decent words and even his voice was different
and the more he insults you, the more you’ll love him
indeed, they are dearer to us than to them, the natives of those lands
i slipped my feet into my slippers, put on my dressing gown, and went straight to the room where makar was
he always answered me readily enough and to the point, but it invariably ended in abstract constructions and aphorisms so that i could never extract anything personal from him
he explained to me how he had planned it all and where he had got the necessary information, but i’ll tell you about all that later
karamazov exclaimed hysterically, forcing tears from his eyes
why, do you have a message for him?
but i do not see these differences as long as they do not concern me
gradually, i found some sort of explanation
no, it was not yesterday
after her tragedy, she would received a great deal of sympathy from all of us, especially from my mother and tatyana prutkov; however, once she would been installed in mrs stolbeyev's apartment, everybody had begun to neglect her, except perhaps lisa, who often went to visit her
i did not remember his coming in
for a moment that idea took complete possession of my thoughts and feelings, but very quickly i chased it away: if i lay my head on the railroad track, tomorrow they would say i did it because i would stolen and was ashamed of it
take my word for it—he’ll go along with the escape plan
his stabbing his only true friend and his protector with a penknife was the bitterest of all the bitter memories of school that teemed in ilyusha’s head
however, he had not killed him, precisely because his mother had interceded for him,  and so he was not guilty of spilling his father’s blood
she turned red, wounded in her very insolence, so to speak
that same brother of mine, dmitry, has also insulted his fiancée, a highly respectable girl of whom you may have heard
mitya tried to interfere
mitya’s head was resting on her breast
and that is exactly what we have done
i want you to know, my dear friend, that i am capable of appreciating your devotion to me and am eternally grateful to you for it
it was for the sake of this money that my father was killed
she has never been so sincerely sorry after laughing at me
soon after my duel, still wearing my officer’s uniform, i spoke in various houses in town about my views on servants
everybody knew that the trial had aroused great interest among the general public, that people could hardly wait for it to begin, that everyone in town had been talking, conjecturing, exclaiming, and making surmises about the trial for the past two months
but can’t you help it?
mais brisons-la, mon cher
the whispering grew louder and more distinct
he recognized me and hurried over to me
mitya rushed up to him
that’s why i’m carrying on, mr miusov, to be good company, you know, although there are times when i don’t really know myself why i do it
i won’t be able to stand his looking at me
of course, the principal beneficiaries are those who have no conscience at all and so obviously cannot be tormented by guilt
do me this favor, my boy, stop at chermashnya on your way
oh, i no longer have the strength to leave now!
my mind was already made up
oh no, you certainly could not have seen me there!
for i do not believe there can be anyone more wretched than they
was sergei here again just now?
so we go there, and the ispravnik appears, and he turns out to be a big, fat fellow with blondish hair and an unsmiling face—the most dangerous type in such cases—it’s their livers, you see, their livers
how dare you drag miss anna versilov into all this?
wait, wait, alyosha interrupted him anxiously
in fact, it was more than an impression, it was a shock
and alyosha told, very excitedly, like someone who unexpectedly sees clearly something that has been obscure to him until then, how during their last meeting mitya had struck his breast—the upper part of his breast—saying that he had there what was necessary for him to restore his honor
another thing, karamazov—tell me, what sort of a man is his father?
well, i was told that two days ago he was belaboring me for all he was worth at katerina’s
oh, i do not mean the age difference—that's quite unimportant, that's nothing—but
alyosha hurried to the municipal hospital, to which they had transferred mitya the day after the trial, when he became ill with a nervous fever
but i’m sure that life will follow its proper course in the end: the worthy man will occupy his rightful place and the unworthy one will vanish in some dark alley and never be heard of again
talk to him, scribble me a couple of lines, give the note to the priest, and he’ll see to it that i get your message in no time
arkasha, darling, forgive me, dear, but how could i not tell
for some reason he imagined i was some sort of revolutionary and thought he was being very subtle
the disgrace lies not in the fifteen hundred rubles, mitya said firmly, but in the fact that i had put them aside from the three thousand
but it's possible that he was simply acting out of charity
perezvon rushed after him and they both disappeared
they were talking about the russian aristocracy
no, i did not attend her
it's great to love passionately, to love with all the generosity that exists in a man and of which a woman is incapable, but it's also great to be able to bully her
she spoke in a jangling, suffocating voice, so that the word preferable came out as prefe-a-able, with the middle a syllable bleated out as if by a sheep
suppose i walk along the nevsky prospect and i observe on the opposite sidewalk a gentleman whose character i would like to investigate
the weeping, humiliated, heartbroken girl had suddenly turned into a strong, self-possessed woman, in full control of the situation and pleased with the news she had just heard
perkhotin cried again, gazing wildly at dmitry
not to anybody, but above all not to you
he was perhaps the only man in the world, besides the prosecutor himself, to be convinced of the man’s extraordinary psychological endowments and oratorical talents, and he shared his conviction that he had not been properly appreciated by his superiors
i looked at her and she seemed to be looking back at me in the darkness, without moving
he came from a family of landed gentry, and as a very young man he had been in the army, serving as an officer in the caucasus
tell me, were we right in preaching and acting as we did?
so the expectations have come true, after all!
alyosha dear, let’s not quarrel from the very beginning
and everything was later carried out according to this plan offered to us in writing, the prosecution claims
anything new that you might reveal to them now would encroach upon the freedom of their faith, for it would come to them as a miracle, and fifteen centuries ago it was freely given faith that was most important to you
just like you, at school, i never liked other boys
i readily promised that i would stay until evening and that i would do my best to distract him when he awakened
mitya listened to them attentively, then simply shrugged
but why are you giving it to me, since that was what you killed him for?
mother was busy doing something upstairs and did not come down when the woman arrived, so daria and i were all alone
the elder had awakened and, although he felt extremely weak, had asked to be moved from his bed to the armchair
nevertheless i felt good
i could have undone the clasps, taken the album out of the case, and leafed through it
i came to luga with despair in my heart and for some reason stayed at mrs stolbeyev's, probably hoping to find solitude there
i repeat, i would never seen him in such a tense state, although his face was all brightness and gaiety
and you knew only too well that your act would be recorded in books, that it would reach the remotest corners of the earth and be passed on down to the end of time
the innkeeper trifon appeared at the top of the steps
i believe my teeth were chattering
but instead of exultation, everything inside him grew suddenly dark and a deep despair, such as he had never known before, enveloped his heart
let us only bear in mind that he was one of our contemporary fathers, and i hope the public will not be too offended if i suggest that there are many such fathers today
again, one hundred and forty half-imperials were counted out to me
he's as stupid as his own big toe and is only interested in getting that thirty thousand rubles with my help, but nevertheless he's the only friend i have
he’s not a local man and he’s not in town at the moment
what’s this new puppy you have?
the other five boys, who were betting with him, waited in the bushes around the embankment, their hearts pounding with apprehension and remorse
but i don’t believe katerina has anything to do with it at all; i think their secret is about something completely different
how long have they been here?
and now i must explain briefly why they let me off so easily
the most tangible reason for my visit was, of course, that letter again, but my sudden overwhelming impulse to go and see her must have been due to other causes that i still cannot quite explain—they had to do with the obscure remarks i would just heard about a certain baby and about certain exceptions becoming the rule
you don’t believe that we got rid of it, do you?
mrs khokhlakov had long felt sorry for him and now she offered him an extremely sensible piece of advice—namely, to quit his debauchery, leave his ugly passion, stop wasting his youthful energy in taverns, and, instead, to go gold-mining in siberia where, she said, he would find an application for his turbulent energies and his romantic character which so longed for adventure
in the first place, i found vasin's room more and more irritating
here, sir, please, accept forty rubles
for i may take a knife with me when i go there, i haven’t decided yet
all i know is that mother is completely shattered
for a whole month he had been visualizing the scene of the crime and preparing himself for it, so as soon as he caught sight of something that could be used as a weapon, he picked it up
i never thought that an intelligent man like you would want to talk about that anymore
but as it happened, he dashed off to his father’s place, unexpectedly, spontaneously, and the chances are that he did not even remember about his drunken’ letter at all
then you sat down on the sofa and took a sip of coffee out of a cup on the table
so that’s how they feel!
i could not understand her emotional outburst; i would never suspected her capable of anything like that
young smurov suddenly cried out
it would be possible to bring back to life a heart that had long been dead and frozen
there was great strength in his look
he got up, clasped his hands again, and the next thing i knew he was kneeling before me
this was the cradle of europe and that thought filled me with love and kindred feelings
she had picked him because he was single and also because she had been dissatisfied with his behavior, and he was aware of this
he was holding a big book, so big, indeed, that it seemed to me that he had difficulty carrying it
you will find out later
then you started saying something in french to mrs prutkov that at once brought a frown to her brow
mitya, incidentally, visited their house rather seldom
three thousand, is not it?
for quite some time i have been feeling guilty toward you
so what else could i do with myself?
now, take the classical languages—it’s sheer madness
well, honest widow, he said to her, i want to be a real benefactor to your son, and do everything that can be done for him
and it is possible that no one except smerdyakov knew where fyodor karamazov had hidden it
soon, however, he resigned, moved to petersburg, and became a counsel for parties involved in private lawsuits
i wasn’t talking about faith in general, but about that particular trait, about those two hermits, about just that small detail which is so completely russian—it’s typically russian, isn’t it?
for two days he said no more about it, but then he asked, how's the boy?
the case now appeared in quite a new light
miusov settled in paris for good and lost sight of mitya, his interest in the boy petering out completely after the february revolution, which made such an ineradicable impression on him
and it happened today, did not it?
here is the letter he wrote me that night
mitya again grabbed the coachman by the shoulders
i wrote you a stupid letter and you consented to what i asked and came here
i’ve seen money in my time
the elder raised his hand and was about to make the sign of the cross toward ivan, when ivan suddenly got up, walked over to him, received his blessing, kissed his hand, and went back to his seat—all without uttering a sound
they all gaped at him in silence, sensing that something disgraceful was about to happen, something absurd that would end in a disgusting public exhibition
he, for his part, did not pursue the matter any further
what did you say?
very shortly after losing her husband, the inconsolable widow took all her daughters (they had no sons) on a long trip to italy, sending alyosha to live with two ladies who were distant relatives of mr polenov’s
a note of total sincerity vibrated in her voice
and what do you think—he demanded that i give him a promissory note for the remaining twenty-three hundred payable to a certain merchant, feeling that it would be safer that way
i’m nothing but a bug and i most humbly admit that it’s quite beyond me why things are arranged the way they are
this is a temptation, but i will ignore it, i finally made up my mind
but, as i have said before, all these views will be combined and arranged in the prosecutor’s summation, to which we shall now come
but i wonder if i may ask you something without making you angry: is it true that you are getting married?
don’t you know,  the saint said to the woman, how bold these little ones are before the throne of the lord?
you know—well, don’t laugh now—about a year or so ago i composed a sort of poem and, if you’re willing to waste, say, another ten minutes with me, i could recite it to you
so you must learn to love for nothing, like alyosha
but i will come to that later, although no, perhaps i wo not, i do not think it's of much interest
if there was anything in the world i least expected at that moment, it was to see her appear and i leaped up in alarm
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god, he read and flung the book violently away
a sarcastic smile played on his lips
i told you everything before, everything, but not that, because even i wasn’t brazen enough to talk about it
he stopped, turned his head toward me, and waited
the temperature was eleven degrees below zero (centigrade) and the ground was crusted with ice
he sat in his chair and watched his neighbor miusov with a sarcastic little smile, obviously delighting in his frustration
i was so obsessed with him that i almost forgot my main goal
i was preparing for my university entrance examination then
fine, fine,  they may object to this, but still, when he got there, he killed his father and took the money
if she was trying to find out what her daughter was up to, it would be her right and there’d be nothing low about it!
it would simply transfer the concept of the state from the wrong premises to the correct ones, to the only true way of achieving the eternal goals
they flayed him alive and he died a martyr’s death, praising and glorifying christ
at times, though, there was an absent, obstinate look about him: he could listen to you without taking his eyes off you, while thinking of something completely different
true, thanks to that attitude, he remained inscrutable to me since i could not possibly humiliate myself by begging him to take me seriously
what do you mean it's your money?
i remember how elated i was
and there was something vague about the otherwise determined look in his rather large, dark, somewhat bulging eyes
go in and see for yourself what’s going on in there
yes, for the moment, you will have to put up with it
what are you talking about?
i was terribly surprised
but do you really imagine that versilov comes to see you to remind you of the money you owe him?
it had just about everything that could be found in a large store in the capital, all sorts of delicacies, all the wines bottled by yeliseyev brothers & co; it carried all kinds of fruit, cigars, and, of course, tea, coffee, sugar, and such things
it was only then that they learned that this saint had broken his vow of obedience to his elder and so, despite his great exploits, had to be pardoned by his elder before he could receive christian burial
mother, do you remember that when you came to visit me at touchard's school i did not even want to recognize you?
i think that, in most cases, a man becomes revolting to look at when he laughs
an exactly similar scene took place here when i was burying versilov after having torn him out of my heartbut after that there was a resurrection from the dead
he just stared wildly around him
but in that same second he caught sight of ilyusha’s little boots by the boy’s bed
i don’t think i’ll go there at all anymore
first there will be the likes of him, then there’ll be better ones
we’ll come back to that, magistrate nelyudov said quickly; in the meantime, i would like the clerk to write down this point, namely, that you considered the money in that envelope as your rightful property
besides, he won’t marry her because she will never marry him, katerina added with a strange smile
since we sat talking together late into the night, i wo not attempt to repeat all that was said and will restrict myself to noting down the facts that shed light on a facet of versilov that until then had remained a mystery to me
this letter was written by the late stolbeyev himself, whose will gave rise to the lawsuit between versilov and the princes sokolsky
and even then, the older of the two brothers, ivan, did not express his suspicion of smerdyakov until today, when he was obviously feverish and in a state of nervous disorder, for during the past two months we know for fact that he shared the general conviction of his brother’s guilt and he never even tried to argue against it
but when he opened the door, she screamed:
good afternoon, von sohn, how are you?
no one, no one at all
and now leave me, please
then all they had to do was shovel the earth on top of it, pack the earth down with a roller, and then pave it over, and everything was smooth and neat and the stone was gone!
i’ve just remembered something that had quite slipped my mind, he said, but then, at the time, i didn’t grasp its meaning and it is only now that
so the devils in hell started moaning and crying because they thought they wouldn’t get no more sinners after that
well, i will die before i ask versilov about lambert!
i suddenly heard next to me the voice of a distinguished-looking gentleman in a blue overcoat
i assumed he was ironically implying that kraft's reasoning was faulty or even stupid
and what made you decide to take that money yesterday?
this caused me to slip into a vulgarly familiar tone
perhaps, the thought flashed through his head, she’s overdoing her enthusiasm a bit
but i see that you feel more like dancing around just now than debating such matters
i want them to be reassured
i’m just an ordinary murderer!
as long as i’m strong enough to walk around, i’ll do so; when i can no longer stand on my feet and have to stay in bed, let them give me any medical treatment they can think of, he decided, dismissing his illness with a shrug
so she took me to petersburg and entered me in the cadet corps school
lately i had been very rude at home, mostly to her
the fellow who will be in the restaurant, the pockmarked son of a bitch, he's a real shrewd trickster, so you would better not talk to him or, if he starts asking you all sorts of questions, answer him any kind of rubbish you can think of
why, i’m not going to do anything, he said, suddenly addressing grushenka, who had pulled back toward kalganov and was tightly clutching his hand
but even now, at night, i go back to the servants’ cottage, the agreement being that until midnight i’m not to go to bed, but must make the rounds of the yard every so often, watching out for miss grushenka, for whom he’s been waiting the last few days just as if he’d gone mad
when i used to pay for his drinks in the tavern, he had a quite different look, mitya thought, as he climbed into the cart
the prosecutor screwed up his nose slightly as if he had tasted something bitter; he obviously did not quite approve of his colleague’s putting the question so openly
and if i sometimes talk nonsense, it is actually intentional, to make people laugh, to please them
when i left for petersburg, i decided to give mr versilov every satisfaction he might demand of me
ah, how did you put it?
he didn’t seem to understand the question
i do not really know why she felt she had to kiss lisa, but i was sure it was the right thing to do
true, i am in a bit of a rush, but i am terribly glad to see you
ah, i forgot that i came here to punish myself, she added, her expression changing abruptly from what it had been when they were murmuring lovingly to each other
she must be terribly worried by now
no civilization without god?
he came, he shouted, give me three thousand rubles
oh yes, of course, everything
it is true, though, that four years had passed since the old merchant had installed her in that cottage, after bringing her back with him from the capital of the province, and much had changed since then
so now i am just trying to maintain my reputation as a respectable man while trying to make a living somehow or other and being a congenial companion
the next second he felt very cold
he had provoked me to this parting scene
therefore, the old prince would have to make his move: perhaps run away, join anna, and marry her within twenty-four hours
is it true, then, what i heard about you going around preaching and wearing chains?
then he snatched at them with his other hand, crumpled them, and squeezed them tightly in his fist
i do not know how such behavior is supposed to be judged nowadays, what thoughts you have on the subject, or how you believe it should affect your mother, your brother, your father
those pale young ladies are worth nothing, not a thing; you should have seen how i handled them when i was twenty-eight
whose child is he?
in a few days i’ll be leaving the monastery for good, and once i’m out in the world, i know i must get married: he said so
in the beginning i could not understand what he had on his mind or why he came, but later i thought that, from a certain point of view, it was not so stupid on his part
i shouted, beside myself
don’t make up with him, papa, don’t
i am leaving now and in an hour or so i may be back here with ka-terina
in fact, i am sure i am not worthy of her or lisa
it's all so frightening!
but his daughter—if anyone has a strong character, it is anna!
and so he sat now, realizing full well that he was delirious, with his eyes focused, as i’ve already mentioned, on that point on the sofa opposite him
now let me tell you the trick that young gentleman played last week
he had returned to our town to stay only about three years before alyosha came
maximov suggested with a chuckle
but, all right, i will let it go one more time
he seemed sincerely delighted to see me:
well, if that’s what you want, i have no objections
i know that neither of you will ever leave me
i am very fond of sergei!
first you must let me finish
i’ve heard a lot about you, too
i got up, went back to my room, and lay down too
perhaps once you’ve had a glass of this stuff, you’ll start the dance, though
then, with a most dignified air, he went back to puffing at his pipe
for many years now, people in russia have been wringing their hands beseechingly and begging us to stop this madly galloping troika
i offended him, he kept repeating sadly
she’s really the queen of all the world’s imaginable she-devils!
his name is gorstkin, but that’s not what they call him: he’s known as the hound’ in the district
if only i would had an inkling of what was on her mind at that moment!
when he was going to be confirmed, a priest called abbe rigaud came to congratulate him
i will go and get the landlord, anna said, getting up
i cried and sobbed
in the next few days, after studying the depositions of the witnesses and the available evidence, ivan became entirely convinced of dmitry’s guilt
the blood had dried, but not to the point of becoming hard and crumbling
useless and unrelated thoughts kept drifting into alyosha’s head, as often happens during a time of idle waiting
nowadays everybody hangs himself!
he pointed at the permanently locked side door between my room and my landlord's quarters, now occupied by the old prince
once, however, he said more
last week he even made a scene about kuzma
absorbed as i was in all these thoughts, i did not notice that i would finally reached home, that is, mother's house
moreover, the notorious manuscript turned out to be nothing but a translation of some french material that he had been collecting for his private edification, to be used only as reference for a learned article he was planning to write eventually for a magazine
strictly speaking, of course, this is true now
i no longer saw why i should be so upset by whatever lambert may have told him
but i had no control—it sort of happened on its own
i remember sitting by the schoolroom window, looking out at the dusty street and the few passers-by
the boys of the third class at once made up the following epigram:
versilov mumbled, throwing a cursory glance in my direction
no, i never believed it, grushenka said firmly; i knew he was an honorable man
that is so, but what came of it?
he did not seem particularly interested
i wo not do anything against you; you need not worry
do you understand what i mean by that?
imagine a baby in the arms of his trembling mother, with turks all around them
he listened to the story, sipping his brandy, and remarked that the soldier in question ought to be immediately promoted to sainthood and the skin that had been peeled off him sent to some monastery: you can just imagine all the people who’d go running, and all the money they’d make
so it has been destroyed!
listen, i usually have tea at this hour; i must go and order it, and you will have some with me, wo not you?
much could happen before then
but this time it was lisa
moreover, it so happened that the child’s relations on his mother’s side had also, at first, forgotten his existence
how do you know what she told me?
he could hardly catch his breath
moreover, it is no longer so rare to find fathers and heads of our culture-bearing families mocking and ridiculing values that their children may still have been happy to believe in
usually we— that is, my mother, my sister, and i—would get up around eight, while versilov lingered in bed until half past nine or so
i was flying through the air as if something were pushing me
the women roared with laughter
mitya, do you hear bells jingling?
he was unable to love passively: as soon as he came to love someone, he had to help that person
and you’re supposed to have seen god!
and besides, the whole town is in an uproar about his wild revelries!
i am purposely describing here scenes from my early daydreams to convey my idea as clearly as i can
when the champagne was served, he held out his glass to me:
i don’t see how katerina, with her intelligence and her almost morbid sensitivity, could have failed to foresee that people would say just such things
but this is sheer delirium, gentlemen, the police inspector exclaimed
he first stared blankly at me, then frowned with exasperation
but then, i suppose you have a gold mine or something
but the worst thing about his type is that they can’t understand a joke
so these were the thoughts that were choking me too like a noose
now you’re talking nonsense
in the end, however, he started brooding; he gradually became aware of the burden weighing on his conscience and then realized he was not strong enough to bear that burden
but contact with real life will cure you, it never fails to, with natures such as yours
what will i do then?
he said quietly and resignedly, listening in surprise to his own voice, and then, completely unexpectedly, he sat down on the bench
a man who has done many vile, despicable things, but an honorable man nevertheless
yes, there is a little of that
have you quarreled or something?
did you see it?
oh, it was not just the war that was going on, nor what had happened at the tuileries— i would always known that all that was fated to go, that the whole old european world would vanish sooner or later
besides, it was she who sent him away, although he may have been a bit hasty in accepting his dismissal
the night at zershikov's, where we saw each other for the last time
to that, i would answer once more that my young man had faith, a sacred and unshakable faith, and that i still refuse to apologize for him
perhaps i would already promised him the last time he came
maria, too, got up
i was prevented by my guardian angel and that’s something you’ve forgotten to take into consideration
ah, the hell with
could it be, by any chance, that it is your blood in me that makes me so proud?
although his words were slurred and rather hard to understand, his tone was firm and he obviously did not wish to add anything more
it was obvious from her expression that she had come on business, that she had something to tell him
but she does want to get married and she’s been thinking and thinking and thinking about a husband, and so she got him in the end
of course, i followed him to the door
so see you soon, lisa darling, sweet little lisa!
you ca not see him, there's only his song mingling with the hymns, almost blending into them, although it's completely different from them—i must manage to convey that somehow
in general, dmitry felt that, whatever happened later, whichever way things turned out, he had to face the imminent clash with his father first
are you coming to dinner tonight?
and this was exactly what perkhotin decided to do
but i restrained myself and took the handkerchief
he served some liqueur too—the liqueur those rich ladies send him
during the days of my dreamy moscow loneliness the seed of the idea appeared in my mind while i was still in the second year of high school and has never left me since
and even now when it's all in the past, i still find it infinitely hard to describe my idea
that must be the sabaneyev who used to work for the kuzmichevs, i guess, one of the women suggested
why did she send for a doctor too?
she wants me to go to him, i was thinking, struggling into my coat while running downstairs, but where was i supposed to look for him?
as i was to find out later, she would just learned something which had upset her terribly and from which she would not yet recovered
in the end, however, they left him in peace and stopped calling him little girl, at most feeling a little sorry for him for being so peculiar in that respect
all right, to pay back a debt
she was pleased to have someone else there and, for my part, i could tell her a few things that shed some light on what had happened
i no longer knew through which door we would entered and, without giving it much thought, i opened one of them and found myself in a long, narrow room with a settee in it and someone sitting on the settee
there was nothing more he could do
i got up, walked over to her, and handed her the money
i’m sorry, i feel too weak
i understand it all too well
she's as lovely as an english engraving
you’ve got quite an eye, you know
with grushenka, he felt easier than with alyosha, although he spoke very little to her
you know, i have the impression that i am splitting into two
do you believe that i love you with my whole soul, alyosha?
no, you must forgive me, perhaps i did not put it right, she hastened to correct herself
but soon someone knocked on the door and when i opened it, to my great surprise, i saw trishatov
i remember that it was at that juncture that the letter was read aloud in court by the clerk; the public was horribly shocked
i lied and they all started repeating my lies
i can see that just by the way you were frightened
i believe he was rather pleased about that too
how can i leave him?
it's possible to win, but until now i have gambled like a fool, leaving everything to chance
why are you keeping him?
what is there to explain?
qu'est-ce que c'est que qa qu'une dame russe sur les eaux minerales et  ou est donc la jolie montre que lambert vous a donnee?
you would better dare, colonel!
his voice faltered and he hardly managed to articulate the last words
yes, that’s what i’ll do
it still bore three seals
so i, with my bad foot, dragged myself to her room and when i got there, she threw herself on me, started kissing me, and wept, and, still kissing me, pushed me out of her room without a word of explanation, so that i never found out anything
alyosha told him heatedly
just as expected, alyosha found his father sitting at table
i exclaimed, completely stunned again
mother, what are you trying to do, to kill me?
but when he's alone in the wild, it's different, for there he can harden himself and be ready for any sacrifice
but do not you think he worded that letter in an awfully funny way?
i can see very plainly that you are planning to doublecross me all the way
instead, he would left the house before daybreak, vanished into thin air, and that woman daria even said that he probably would not be back at all
and i’ll prove to them that i have nothing in common with that aesop, that clown, that ridiculous pierrot, that i was in his company by sheer bad luck, just as everyone else was
as perezvon was performing his last trick, the door opened and agafia, a fat, pockmarked woman of forty, appeared
he said, inviting mitya with a gracious gesture
because of uncontrollable curiosity
just look at yourself!
but they happen to be my worst and, above all, my most stupid and vulgar thoughts
i think i understand everything now, alyosha said quietly and sadly, without getting up
this gesture of mine was, of course, immediately interpreted as my intention to strike her
and now he's completely ecstatic, they say, and only wondering why such a brilliant idea did not occur to him first
i had decided to go back to vasin's
as soon as he had the deed in his hand, he would at once have mobilized a whole army of polish and jewish lawyers and they’d have managed to get him not just three thousand—they’d have stripped my father of the whole estate!
i was gaping at him in bewilderment and suddenly discerned something that might have been a glimmer of pity in his loathsome look
on these occasions i’m always against women, against their tears and hysterical outbursts
for a good twenty-five years now, he had been marrying off distant young relatives of his or his wife's, cousins, stepdaughters, or perhaps goddaughters
we were talking about my convictions and not about my age, remember?
the doctor was very offended, which in itself shows the kind of person he was, but continued his visits
conceit there may be, that comes from youth and it will pass if you really think it should pass
later, when trouble began in the house, when grushenka appeared on the scene and the tension between his father and his brother dmitry increased, ivan and smerdyakov discussed these matters too
i wouldn’t have done it without him coming
is that really necessary?
i just stared at her, not knowing what to do next
well, all right, come here, and give a kiss to an old idiot!
he stood over me briefly, inquiring whether i had eaten, but i just waved him away
what did you think of that?
in brief, there was a good chance of getting another six or perhaps even seven thousand out of the old man, for chermashnya was worth at least twenty-five, i mean, twenty-eight thousand
was it to give him in advance the clues as to who committed the crime?
he kept exclaiming, looking at ilyusha, for he used to call him old man as a term of affection, when the boy was still alive
and that's just terrible, terrible!
he did not say 'korovkin'; he said  wouldolgorovki,  meaning dolgoruky, he explained to me
this prayer will be heard and it will please the lord
but fetyukovich made short shrift of their reputations too
it was to avoid such misgiving that i instinctively began to seek self-sufficiency
i admit that, if i were in your place, i would not go around celebrating the fact that i was illegitimate
but i must admit, mr ivan, that i thought you’d guessed everything, smerdyakov said in a completely innocent tone
there is a drive in me that can withstand anything, ivan said coldly, with a twisted grin
all right, never mind then
oh no, you and he, you can go right ahead, and i’ll step out of your way so as not to disturb you!
the way ilyusha wanted it
and she vanished like a ghost
i think i’ve offended alyosha
he had turned frightfully pale
ah, yes, it’s that wedding, that marriage, of course
at this point i gave up all this senseless tangle and my head sank hopelessly onto the pillow
ah, how little you understand me, my dear!
that’s the third time i’ve told you
kolya’s hand dove into the satchel once again and emerged with a little vial that contained real powder
i am in love with youth!
i was wondering why you hadn’t asked me to do so from the beginning
mitya was rather pleased with this arrangement—if she sits there with samsonov, at least she won’t be rushing off to father’s
the eyes of all the spectators were fastened on him
but it turned out that averyanov's signature had been forged
but you understand that it’s just the same as if it were yours, for he’ll always let you play with it
we’ll check it all, go over it all again with the other witnesses—in your presence of course, examining magistrate nelyudov said, concluding the session
but before you go in, karamazov, may i ask just one thing, if it’s all right with you?
they were both there, mitya
nevertheless, that german hit it just right
lise cried, looking at alyosha in amazement
what was that officer threatening?
more than once, sometimes during the day and sometimes at night, i would heard strange sounds coming from it, but since they would never lasted for more than a few seconds and had been followed by total silence, i would never paid much attention to them
but is it true that he kissed that portrait?
run along, tell him i am coming
when i saw that, i left
i learned lots of them by heart and recited a fable to andronikov each time i entered his tiny study, whether he was busy or not
i wish i knew how to make you like me always, he muttered, blushing too
ivan karamazov had been graduated from the university, had collected his two thousand rubles, and was planning to take a trip abroad, when one of the major newspapers carried a very strange article of his that caught the interest even of non-specialists
he tapped the signal, father opened the door for him, and
after that you can decide for yourself what to do next
at this point i would like to say for myself personally that it makes me quite sick when i think of all the commotion caused by that phenomenon, which, though it was unpleasant and unsavory, was at the same time unimportant and quite natural
they have a private posting station, mr karamazov
ah, the way you looked when you first came in!
everyone was shouting that he was the murderer and i felt that, if he had killed his father, he must have done it because of me
right now i still know too little about the stock exchange, shares, the banking business, and the whole world of high finance
after that, he continued to sit in the same spot, hardly stirring
we would been looking for each other and fate had brought us together, giving both of us a similar strange feeling
but i can’t help it, things just get said by themselves whether i want them to or not
he himself had finished eating and was drinking tea
thus, the conciliation of claims between church and state on such matters as the administration of justice is, in my opinion, quite impossible by its very nature
oh, i would be able to hide my money in my corner so that they would not steal it from me or even suspect i had any at all—that i can guarantee!
well, that touchard follow walked in with a letter in his hand, went up to the big oak table at which all six of us were sitting doing our homework, grabbed me by the shoulder, lifted me from my seat, and told me to pick up all my books and follow him
oh, be gone, vile memory!
she was wearing her fur coat and was accompanied by—or rather was walking arm in arm with—a tall, straight-backed, forbidding-looking officer in full uniform, including sword, while a lackey followed behind, carrying the officer's greatcoat
i’ll tell you, sir
i would like to introduce you, arkady, anna said in a very loud voice
how can it be such a joy to you, my darling, when you are so feverish at night and cough so that it sounds as if your chest is about to burst
that’s what he called very quickly
ah, my lovely ones, don’t blame your own mother!
and so he pulled his hand back from the bell and rushed off to smerdyakov’s
for instance, at this moment, could
there was no one else in there with her and she was obviously waiting
love is such an infinite treasure it can buy the whole world and can redeem not only your sins, but the sins of all people
but i still appreciate your welcome and i will remember it
did you say difficult?
but it makes no sense!
he already knew the sick girl—she came from a village only five miles from the monastery and had been brought to him on several previous occasions
you know very well, alyosha said in a low and penetrating voice
i have only come to warn you
she received me politely but was very matter-of-fact and not in the least chatty, which reconciled me somewhat to the place
it would be charming, he said, looking at me penetratingly, provided, of course, your stories are really amusing
you’re wrong, monk, it was for just that kind of love!
five minutes, they go on to ten, harder, faster, more stingingly
right, ilyusha, there’s nothing in this world more powerful than the rich
such suggestions only made smerdyakov turn pale with indignation, although he never answered anything
when pressed both by the prosecutor and the defense counsel, the doctor confirmed that ivan karamazov had come to consult him two days previously, that he had warned him that the threat of a brain fever attack was imminent, but that the patient had refused to be treated
the presiding judge then read off the questions that the jurors were to answer and asked both sides to make their final statements
and grabbing alyosha by the arm, the captain led him out of the room and into the street
may i say that i know my brother, dmitry karamazov, is now very sorry for what he did and that, if you would allow him to come and see you or, if you prefer, to meet you in the same public place and apologize to you before everybody, he would do so
it was simply that we felt like going
but before ivan had taken three steps, he called out: mr ivan!
you know, my dear boy, i have never been able to imagine men turning into ungrateful and stupid animals
he was a freckled redhead and was not too big
one especially, at the end of the row, caught his attention
oh, you should have seen how frightened he was when he came here!
the furniture was white, very old, upholstered in a red silky material, which was worn and faded
i was sitting here, before you came, and do you know what i was thinking about?
real laughter must be free of malice, while it is malice that makes people laugh mostly
what sort of a man is your landlord?
so how can anyone tell a man that there's no point in him doing anything?
ivan had always respected alyosha’s opinion and that was why he was so bewildered by it now
without hesitation, i opted for the idea, for i thought i had mathematical proof that it would work
sure, and now i have not got one kopek leftl  i see you ca not do it either
he’s visited me twice, maybe even three times
was it simply to enable him to boast to satan later and say to him something like, see how my saint can suffer for my sake!
i’m a fool and i’m really not worth bothering about
and so he's lived—it's almost ten years now—a life of great austerity, practicing the renunciation of all earthly desires, but he still refuses to take monastic vows
and what about you, von sohn, there’s no point your staying around
the boy stood still, waiting
stingy though i am, i’ll open that bottle
but one day a first cousin of adelaida’s returned from paris
besides, to get home you have to turn right here
i suddenly cried out loud, feeling the blood rush to my face
he doesn’t really care
it doesn’t become you very well, ivan said, laughing
the gift of making people love him was inherent in him; he gained people’s affection directly and effortlessly; it was part of his nature
i never trust people who like that sort of musty tidiness and especially the servile deference of their landladies
and he, dmitry, he may never have loved you either
oh, it's not that i was betraying her, but i had to be on his side
however, if you have spoken to me so frankly only to make me praise you for your sincerity, then, of course, you will fail to accomplish true acts of love; all your good intentions will remain mere daydreams, and your whole life will slip by like a shadow
his face looked changed—it was radiant with joy
but that does not seem to embarrass the shameless creature
but now, as i write, my cheeks are red from shame
can you possibly mean what you say?
he remembered it long afterward
and all that time i was insolently sprawling on sergei's sofa, playing at being his equal, trying to be familiar with his lousy friends!
but i want to tell you for the last time: i am not guilty of my father’s murder!
they had been until then in the house frequented by the gilded youth that i would stopped patronizing
as god is my witness, i acquired it involuntarily
indeed, even when he was still very young, he reached a point where nothing either shocked or horrified him
it’s true, though, that father wanted to tell me something else yesterday, but somehow couldn’t in his excitement
so i emigrated, he went on, without regretting anything that i would left behind
it's some sort of nervousness or over-sensitivity that he must have contracted living in the monastery
he was getting a bad headache
well, since it will be lodged in my brain, i’m rather curious to see what it’s really like
what are you doing with alphonsine?
also, while still in moscow, i decided that i would not be a pawnbroker or usurer
they had finished eating when alyosha arrived
there were times when i would look at him and wonder how a man like that could possibly ever have sat on government committees or presided at shareholders' meetings
no, it wasn’t me!
the fellow said angrily; i know you all right!
we had a fight and then made it up
rakitin’s position at the monastery was too lowly for him to be invited to the father superior’s table
and i’ll know but will say nothing
no, it was my rage that tormented me
so let us be on our way, mr karamazov
she cried with a renewed burst of indignation
i could not have expected less from a man of your kindness, dmitry said, interrupting him in his turn
it’s a real heartbreak, a fantastic farce: she’s in love with your brother ivan but is trying very hard to convince herself that she’s really in love with your brother dmitry
and you simply stumbled upon him at just such a moment
i have been so astounded by it all this time that i have kept asking myself: could she really be that woman?
and if that is so, if russia and her justice are really what i know they are, may russia forge ahead, ahead, and let no one try to frighten us with stories about madly galloping troikas, from which foreign nations pull back in disgust!
i noticed that, for all his urbane polish and the twenty-year distance that separated us from the events, he was extremely reticent and evasive
his plan was to lure both mrs prutkov and me out of the apartment before katerina was due to arrive, if only for a quarter of an hour
so i sprawled on the sofa again and opened a book that happened to be lying around
i intend, however, to fight you—i warn you of that—and i shall fight you to the bitter end; after that it will be up to god
and when nelyudov asked whether he himself had knocked on his father’s window, mitya said he had used the signal signifying that grushenka had arrived, and banged it out on the table again
well, i will skip the details, but the result was a very complicated and disgusting scandal
within a second, miusov’s mood switched from the utmost benignity to fury
no, it was not quite that
he sat up straight in his chair and stared in the direction of the poles
whose fault is it that this man, with his naturally good inclinations and his responsive and sensitive heart, was brought up in such a preposterous way?
then the maid nas-tasia knocked on the door and said there was a lady outside inquiring about olga
he rushed off somewhere before seven; he seemed very busy
perhaps there’s something or other?
but she already loved another man, a distinguished, high-ranking army officer; he was away at the time on active service, but she expected him back soon
well, who can tell, perhaps he’d really take me on
you really amaze me!
(his stepfather stebelkov, on the other hand, is still in prison for his involvement in an affair that is getting more and more complicated as time goes by)
my forehead was burning
alyosha, who was almost out of his mind with anxiety for him and for the rest of them, managed nevertheless to support him by the arm
and now see how he repays me for having saved him!
then he gave perkhotin a long, dreamy look, smiling at him
there's no one you need apologize to, kraft said very slowly in a low dreamy voice
ah, i wish i could do it!
it’s just a mile or so from here and, instead of their lenten diet, you’ll get a suckling pig for dinner and i’ll bring out some brandy for you and then some liqueur too—i have, for instance, a certain raspberry liqueur
so, you see, that may be the reason i’m dressed up now, my poor rakitin, grushenka concluded with a wicked chuckle
i want a mathematically precise answer
but once he had started, his thoughts soon shifted to something else
and i’ve been playing around with your brother mitya to stop myself from running to that other man
that was why, after my escape from alphonsine's custody, he did not have much difficulty in finding me (he simply asked for versi-lov's address at the registry office)
i’m ready to leave any time; i don’t suppose there’s anything else you want with me
they christened him paul and registered his patronymic as fyodorovich as a matter of course, without asking anyone’s permission
i’ll bring it all up in court tomorrow
oh, i understand that you have the official authority to question me, but not about any intimate thoughts i may have had
only a man who is completely innocent and is not afraid of being accused of complicity could act this way
you seem pleased despite your sorrow
why have you come to interfere with our work?
he could not bear to stand in the corner for more than a minute
but look at that!
i let slip some wonderful opportunities but tried to control myself and remain calm and self-confident
once he even said to governor schultz: credo, but i’m not sure in what
do not judge me because i have already condemned myself
and perhaps you know, too, that for a couple of months now i’ve been receiving a very nice, well-mannered, serious young man who works here as a civil servant—peter perkhotin
he just winked slyly
mother nature’s milk of joy,
i will report you to your school principal and you’d better see to it that, instead of going about testing your theories, you sit over your books and do your schoolwork!
these heart-warming thoughts poured out of me irresistibly
ah, but what do you expect me to tell you?
the counsel screams in his clients’ defense: this concerns no one but the family!
you must prove to the world at large that there are men ready to uphold it, and that it is in good hands!
i’ve got mixed up
first, this was a way to get even with alyosha—that is, to witness the fall of the upright, alyosha’s transformation from a saint to a sinner—and he was savoring that in advance
that’s not true, kalganov said
at this moment, for instance, there’s a lady waiting for him there with her sick daughter
she must be flogged in public
there seemed nothing i could get out of him
i do not even know who you are talking about
this fact was treasured with sacred fervor by the monks as a beautiful and miraculous pledge of an even greater sanctity for the monastery’s tombs in the future, if, by the grace of god, that time should come
instinctively, i grabbed the doorknob and would not let her close the door
the little pole turned red in the face, got up, and rushed out of the room with the air of a man who can no longer bear such indignity
there was only one hope left: he might have gone to my lodgings, but i no longer thought that very likely
i turned away and joined those who were endeavoring to correct your work
did ivan insist very much?
i can’t believe my eyes!
but you could have taken the initiative and spoken to me first if i was such a fool
and it was true
i can still see his little face at that moment—i’ll never forget it as long as i live, you know
the letter was written hurriedly and the excitement of the writer was evident in every line
she was walking very fast, but when she saw alyosha she turned toward him and said:
also, let me tell you that all this time i have been wanting to see you and talk to you secretly; only i did not know how to arrange it
but all of a sudden she let out a piercing cry and reeled back
well, i suppose i’m doomed to sit with you for god knows how long
alyosha suddenly leapt up from his seat, just as his mother had, threw up his hands, covered his face with them, then collapsed back into his chair as though his legs had been pulled out from under him, and suddenly started shaking in a succession of hysterical, violent, soundless sobs
but later i also found out that it could become immensely proud and that it could crush people with one glance, such as the one you gave me at your father's the day you arrived from moscow
on one side was a wattle fence with vegetable patches behind it and on the other was the tall, strong fence around his father’s garden
he looked like a man about to perform a solemn ritual
his eye was quick, his behavior reserved, and he seemed to be constantly on guard
there she is—can’t you see?
she cried in a heart-rending wail, wringing her hands, as tears filled her eyes
he stopped abruptly and remained silent for a moment
but who is that sabaneyev he was talking about?
wait at least until i’ve left the room
i’m not mavriky to you, remember!
forgive me, good people!
there is nothing more alluring to man than freedom of conscience, but neither is there anything more agonizing
but ivan said in an exhausted voice:
but then i thought you might assault me for having put on only the lion and the sun and not the north star and sirius as well
he could read to them how the brothers later went to buy grain in egypt, where, by that time, joseph had become a powerful man at the court; and, unrecognized by them, he tormented and accused them, and kept his youngest brother benjamin as a hostage, although all the time he loved them—i love you and, loving you, i torment you—but had never forgotten how one day, somewhere in the parched plain, by a well, they had sold him to some passing merchants and he had wept, wringing his hands and begging his brothers not to make him a slave in a foreign land
about five minutes after the bleeding versilov had fallen to the carpet, lambert, who had been lying in a puddle of his own blood and whom we would all assumed dead, suddenly stirred, sat up, and scrambled to his feet
she meekly helped mother in the house and looked after the convalescing versilov, but she practically refused to talk and even avoided looking at anyone
it was already pretty boring before, but they felt they had to make it even more boring; it was already senseless, so they had to make it still more senseless
i’d have been quite incapable of conveying it all to them in a letter
at twenty -eight, dmitry karamazov looked much older than he was
in the first place, they violate rules of social conduct and, in the second place, they raise dust on the boulevard where everybody is entitled to walk—me, ivan, fyodor, everybody
foma was a private in my battalion
it would be good for you to get to know people like her and to learn to appreciate them; yes, and there are so many other things that one can learn from such people, alyosha said with deep conviction
he was gasping for breath
from the living room, a passage led to the kitchen where old lukeria lived and cooked, and one could tell when she was cooking because the whole place reeked of burned fat
it’s for your benefit that he’s putting all this on, he whispered
in any case, i am very grateful to you, he said again
so up on your feet then!
never again to associate the name of my daughter with this sordid story
as a matter of fact, he held himself so straight that his back did not seem to need any support whatsoever, although he was obviously ill he wore over his shirt a short fur-lined jacket; his knees were wrapped in mother's plaid blanket and he had slippers on his feet
when they heard that, all three of them—he and the two seconds—began to shout at me
mitya, who was still holding the crumpled bills in his hand—bills that had attracted everyone’s attention, particularly the two polish gentlemen’s—looked at her in sheepish embarrassment and quickly thrust the money into his pocket
he even seemed to enjoy—indeed, to feel flattered by—his ridiculous role as a cuckolded husband, for he insisted on describing his own disgrace in minute detail, even embellishing on it
were you supposed to be somewhere?
anna versilov had been, since her early childhood, the old prince's favorite (for the prince and versilov had known each other an awfully long time)
he asked smerdyakov, who had followed ivan into the house
i went out into the garden
i realized that lisa was trying hard to control herself, but the second our eyes chanced to meet she could not hold it back any longer and burst into a fit of laughter
and, anyway, if i have not been very straightforward with you, neither have you been with me, she added with a quick smile
oh, it’s about your brother dmitry and all that business that happened recently—you know, lise’s mother explained casually
to answer an important question for me
why did i want to see you so badly?
his request was courteously granted
be specific: where did it happen?
indeed, i believe it would be in poor taste
in any case, the young man did not despair and quickly found work—first tutoring at a few kopeks an hour, then making the rounds of the editorial offices of newspapers, peddling ten-line news items on street incidents or the like that he signed eyewitness
people said later that, in his portrayal of ivan, the prosecutor was motivated, to some extent, by personal resentment, which was quite improper in the present circumstances
that herzenstube always comes and starts by saying that he can’t understand
indeed, the letter proves that the accused had a program,  and this stamps his crime as premeditated murder!
by the way, alyosha, you haven’t seen dmitry today, have you?
and after that enigmatic outcry, without waiting for my answer, she ran out of the room to join them
besides, in that establishment, i would often been lucky
i do not know whether that warden was a decent man or not, nor do i think the question is relevant here, but i do know that he very courteously put a private room at sergei's and my disposal after readily authorizing my visit
we shall be lying, because we do not intend to allow you to come back
i’ll send the carriage to pick you up later
no, you really mustn’t go to her place
in the course of the performance, the virgin comes out on stage and announces her bon jugement in person
but why should kraft's discovery of russia's secondary role weaken men's aspirations for a universal human cause?
for three months, that is, before the question of my going to petersburg even came up, there had been something that would grab my heart and force it to pound wildly in my chest
how right you are, barbara, my daughter, you can’t expect anything sensible from such people,  i told her, and for that time i got out of it that way
so you have definitely made up your mind to leave tomorrow morning?
your trouble is that you are not used to staying long in one place
sounds like smerdyakov, alyosha thought, and she must be the landlady’s daughter, the one who came back from moscow and who has a dress with a train and goes to father’s house to get a bowl of soup from martha
perhaps it was because of his obvious disregard for the generally accepted standards of behavior, for it did not occur to me then that it could be due simply to his imbecility
the effort made the tall fellow's face look incredibly determined
i’m seeing all this in a dream
that is what happened now, as soon as the elder covered the hysterical girl with his stole
that’s where they get it now
wretched all my life i’ll feel
and i went on to tell him about the bear which once came to the hut of a great saint who was seeking salvation in the forest
this is not what the truly jealous man is like
but there's nothing to bind me to you any longer, nothing at all!
i walked home on foot
it’s this way, please
we must be tried together!
i am not frowning, it's just that
so i got to sergei's at about eleven that morning and found versilov there, finishing what appeared to be a long discourse
i could  i could stand anything, but mother, how could she?
you won’t run wild after i leave, will you?
so i may say that, without being vengeful, i do remember insults
when he saw her sleeping, his passion for her flared up
but why did you make such a mystery of it?
tell him that god himself has sent him this opportunity
ah, mother, mother, you came to visit me only once, and now where are you, my faraway visitor?
so he dragged me out into the street just when the boys were walking home from school, and among them was my ilyusha
so what are all these nasty things they have been telling me about you?
but let's talk seriously now; the time has come for that and i have loved you for a long time, my boy
but that too pleased me
i was a bit offended that he felt so sure he could handle me and that it never seemed to occur to him that i might suspect something
please, please, pay no attention to this, she went on, as the tears rolled down her cheeks
he would received it earlier that day, around five in the afternoon
one wonders why the soul should hang on like that in the body and still enjoy being alive
i, for one, have heard the story, and i happen to know that inspector makarov has too
then paint me the biggest picture you have ever painted, big enough to cover this whole wall
god has sent me to tell you this
i had intended to say something unpleasant to him about his attitude toward kraft and i had done my best
as a matter of fact, that is how the ladies often referred to him, as the naughty tease, and this seemed to delight him
i used to bathe him in a trough and he dared to do that to me, gregory repeated
the other day he said he wanted to get up, so they dressed him and put on his shoes, and he tried to walk, but he couldn’t even stand up, kept falling over all the time
i ca not imagine how some people can say that you are a woman swayed by passions!
well, precisely, with such a wide-ranging nature, that covers two abysses, karamazov is capable of stopping dead in the middle of the wildest revelry, if the vision of that opposite abyss occurs to him
for i cannot justify myself to her nor even find the right words to try to make her understand
he had encouraged smerdyakov to talk to him, although he was somewhat taken aback by the confusion, or rather the restlessness, of the lackey’s thoughts, and wondered what it was that so constantly and persistently disturbed that contemplative mind
here, please take it
on the other hand, there were so many excellent arguments to convince him to live: that life is transitory, for instance; that we will all die one day; or one could show him the statistics on how many children die of scarlet fever
mr karamazov cried, tapping himself on the forehead
he began to tremble all over then, and the next thing i knew, there he was kissing my hand again
oh, he used different words, but that was the general meaning
nevertheless, we would still better take a good look at these details
but the little boys teased you and you swore to wreak vengeance on humankind
rakitin was afraid to say the wrong thing
but you must understand that our present earth has repeated itself perhaps as many as a billion times: it died out, got covered with ice, cracked, broke to pieces, decomposed into its original component elements; and again there was just water above the firmament, then again a comet, again the sun, again the earth from the sun—the process can repeat itself infinitely and always in the same way, over and over again, to the minutest detail
give me back my own things at once!
did not you notice how painful it was for him to swallow when that gentleman repeated the gossip about the baron and mrs akhmakov?
versilov began, but luckily he was interrupted by someone asking for the landlord, who immediately rushed off
forgive me, mr ivan—i did think you were like me
when did she say that?
ivan suddenly bent down, picked the man up, and, carrying him on his back, went on until he saw a house with a light inside
but this did not prevent her from bearing fyodor karamazov two sons—ivan, in the first year of marriage, and alexei, three years later
so you can go on talking drivel until you’re blue in the face, you won’t make me lose my temper as you did last time
now, that was really too much, especially in stebelkov's presence
but the drunken old man went on spluttering, noticing nothing, until something very strange happened to alyosha—an exact repetition of what had happened to the boy’s mother on the occasion which he had just recounted
and now i met her by the gate
you told me—the cellar
i can see through you as if you were transparent, ma'am, and still i am not going!
i’ll bring it to you some time
why should i worry about it?
katerina’s invitation sounded so imperious that, after a second’s hesitation, ivan decided to follow alyosha upstairs
pure art, isn’t it?
may god grant that your heart find the answer while you are still on this earth, and may he bless you on your journey through life!
well then, this is a complete program of the crime, so how can he not be the murderer?
i picked up my hat too and, having asked the landlady to give vasin the message that arkady dolgoruky had been to see him, rushed downstairs
you caught me up on my poor phrase
and that was jealousy!
otherwise, i could not tell my story coherently and would have to present it as a series of riddles
still, at the last moment i somehow succeeded in pushing his hand upward and the bullet hit him in the shoulder
smerdyakov seemed to think for a while in silence
who could it possibly have been?
as soon as he arrived, he contacted a former moscow colleague of his who told him that the outlook for their activities in petersburg was very unpromising—nothing of any scope in sight
it was one of those outbursts i had in those days that still give me an unpleasant feeling when i remember them
the defense counsel continued to use every possible trick and he astounded everybody by his intimate knowledge of the minutest detail of the case
i slept for four hours
ivan cried with affected delight
it is by discarding cumbersome and unnecessary demands, by subduing and disciplining selfish and conceited aspirations, by obedience, that the monk, with god’s help, achieves spiritual freedom and thereby finds spiritual happiness
then, abruptly turning away, he started to run
here's another portrait you may want to look at
come now—'abyss of degradation!
and so the feelings i showed toward lisa and our mutual relations were only an affected coolness, a pretended family rivalry, when in reality we had never loved each other more
but try and put a man of letters or a peasant woman in jupiter's place and you will have one uninterrupted thunderstorm!
i suppose he would become somewhat bored, which may happen to anyone but which is nevertheless always hard to analyze
for ste-belkov told me quite unashamedly that he suspected that some forbidden, strictly forbidden, activities must be taking place at dergachev's and that therefore, if i found out something about these activities, i could work myself into an advantageous position
besides, if i am not mistaken, that stone is still sitting there and has not been buried in a hole at all
i don’t know what he thought he saw in my look but the next thing i knew he was rushing at me with his penknife open and he jabbed it into my right thigh, right here, see?
why, i suppose the next step will be to order that i be flogged, for what else is there left?
he certainly wo not spend it here, will he?
how dare you come to the house of a lady who does not know you at such an hour!
his apparently distant behavior was due to a constant inner preoccupation with something strictly personal, something which had nothing to do with other people, but which was so supremely important to him that it made him forget the rest of the world
obviously, the prosecutor insisted on re-examining the witness and he asked alyosha to describe the scene to him again and made him repeat several times that the accused was actually indicating something definite on his chest, rather than just pounding himself with his fist
the other day father paisii described the karamazov drive’ as earthy, frantic, and primitive,  and i don’t even know whether there’s an awareness of the divine spirit beyond that drive
i am sorry, i just ca not get over it!
he was, i assure you, an extremely handsome man; old as he was, he was still  wouldark-visaged, tall, and spare,  as nekrasov's line has it, and, on top of that, unaffected and dignified
her mother had planned to take her abroad in the spring, but they had been detained throughout the summer by urgent business on the estate
i have been screaming about that around town, too!
i had left my old quarters after handing in my resignation
what’s the point of wishing—it’s impossible
and later, when i would thought it all out, it was already too late
i do not believe that: he will never stop loving me, although i may very well be unhappy with him
does god exist or not?
all they had to do was break the stone up, i said, beginning to frown
he recovered his senses at once and now sounded extremely alarmed
i’ll fix it up if you’ll tell me where it is
it was just a short note, only a few lines, which she read in one second
i told him plainly that bodily cleanliness was not just the attribute of a dandy, not just a matter of aesthetics, but that it was essential for a doctor, and i convinced him of it
ivan asked, exasperated but at the same time full of a strange curiosity
i don’t know from whom
i’d like us to get to know each other better
indeed, she had not asked me to
don’t bother with him, papa
it looked like a chapel because of its tremendous number of icons with lamps perpetually burning before them, all brought by visitors to the monastery
he turned away, walking off with a firm step without looking back
his tone was gentle but his voice was highly emotional, almost quavering
tiens, what a coincidence!
did he tell you, sofia?
he had some very important and even somewhat mysterious business to attend to
ah, it would be wonderful to seat mother and nina in the buggy, put ilyusha on the driver’s box, and i would run along beside it, watching my family ride
can you really remember that?
and your paris story, mr miusov, is quite typical
mitya roared, slamming his fist down on the table
if you’d been a young army officer, a dashing hussar, or something of that sort, you’d have drawn your sword and rushed off to fight for russia
we must find out because it will soon be time for us to go back
such as the time you cried on makar's shoulder?
that plain started driving me out of my mind
unless perhaps you wanted to brag about your success?
and i stood there with a sarcastic smile, listening to his words and looking at the tears in his eyes!
as he began his speech, the prosecutor was trembling nervously
please come and join us
nevertheless, later, after her departure that evening, madame touchard said to me, it looks as if you maman used to be rather pretty once
ah, you should see all the tricks he can perform!
for there are many like him, alas, although they do not express themselves as cynically as he did, because they are better bred and more polished
ivan glanced at him scornfully, shrugged, and turned away to look at the road
so one day the boy was running around the yard of the mill when all of a sudden the master, maxim skotoboinikov, drove up on a pair of horses
no, i swear it isn’t true!
and you’re not worried about rabies, are you?
besides, it’s too late for that now
the only reason i’m asking you to do it is that you’re a clever man, and i’m very well aware of it, too
in fact, i did not ask him any questions
oh, sergei, if that's the case
this is the truth: i used to be your enemy until i discovered your nobility and was utterly conquered
guide them onto the path that is right for each one of them, according to your wisdom
the reason for this ostracism was something unspeakably vile and, what is worse, something scandalous in the eyes of society that he was supposed to have done a little over a year ago in germany
mrs prutkov flared up again
as we will never meet again, i do not see why you should care anyway  so give me the true answer to a question sensible people never ask: did you, at any time, ever love me or did i just imagine it?
well, i’d rather put it this way: you and i, we have the same philosophy
at any rate, i heard about certain shares
no, i have no witnesses, except for one, perhaps, ivan added with a dreamy smile
that you so generously
be quiet my heart,
the result was quite different from what he had hoped for
sometimes he’ll tell such lies that you wonder why he’s doing it
they flog the girl for one minute
versilov was pale and spoke with restraint, as though pouring his words through a funnel
there are so many mysteries; so many riddles that weigh man down to the ground
oh, i am not talking about my mother's respectability, for she's always been infinitely higher than you in the moral sense, but she is—if you do not mind my saying so—only a morally superior corpse because versilov alone is alive and all the people around him are there only for the privilege of having him feed on their life juices
he was dressed very correctly that morning—a frock-coat buttoned up all the way and black gloves, and with a top-hat in his hands, exactly the same clothes as he had worn three days earlier at the elder’s, when he had met with his father and brothers at the monastery
but to this day i ca not explain why i turned so red and kept staring into his eyes, unable to look away
and that was why i did not ask her any additional questions about daria
yes, yes, i was just thinking that, but everybody loves it and always, not just at some special moments
and never, never say that again, never
what did i mean by that?
but if he strokes his beard with his left hand and grins as he does it, then he’s just trying to take you in
it was warm, the snow was melting and had turned dark and ugly, and unpleasant smells wafted from the market square
they managed to extract from the lover a tidy little sum without having to take any risks, for, as they well knew, he was only too eager to keep the whole thing quiet
don’t you agree at least with that?
i’ve brought you a little cannon
i must say, though, i can’t really blame you, for i understand very well that you can’t take my word for everything either
i knew you’d stop by yourself
maximov suddenly whispered right into mitya’s ear
he was a russian gentleman of a certain type, no longer young, qui frisait la cinquantaine, as the french would say, with dark, still-thick hair and pointed beard which were only slightly graying
this went on for four years until, finally, dmitry lost patience
who is this podwysocki?
i don’t give a damn about the pestle!
as to what he says about russia, i not only readily believe him, but i welcome it heartily because, if it was generally accepted, it would untie many people's hands, emancipating them from the prejudice of patriotism
he never told me that when telling me about his relations with makar
because it's you who wanted to speak to me, not me to you!
my god, what am i doing that for?
sergei finally became fully convinced
you swore to her yourself that you would burned kraft's letter, did not you?
but let pushkin celebrate
but she was so completely trusting in her embrace and it obviously never occurred to her that i might become annoyed, although a few seconds earlier she would been smiling so ingratiatingly at me
the young prince turned to me with concentrated courtesy, although my name obviously did not ring a bell
the crack was tiny and lise’s voice had a catch in it—it sounded as if she were making a desperate effort to keep from bursting into laughter
and suddenly, my boy, the sun that in the dream was setting on the first day of european civilization turned, upon my awakening, into the sun setting on the last day of our era!
but, when it comes to marriage, that's a different matter
mitya, feeling very embarrassed, bent down, and tried to help her, and finally, between the two of them, they managed to slip the icon under his tie and shirt onto his chest
then suddenly i felt unbearably disgusted at trying to reconstruct the scene; i felt sick and angry, both with them and with myself
and some, very true
and i don’t dislike our dear mitya’s formulation either
but, if i got involved in it now, would i again be caught up like a splinter of wood in a whirlpool?
tn that question, there was a stirring note; she was deeply moved too
in the name of the long ordeal ahead of him, please go and see him now!
i don’t think he is, at least
in the end i pulled aside the curtain that screened off mrs prutkov's bedroom and started pleading with him to put katerina down on the bed
he had thought he would be able to put pressure on smerdyakov by threatening to reveal their conversation, but suddenly it turned out that smerdyakov had already reported it himself
oh, sir, it’s scary to drive you
that smile made maximov’s chin jerk and his lips tremble as he dissolved into tears of gratitude
what about my room?
he dressed in a russian shirt with the collar buttoned on one side and a long-skirted peasant coat; he had considerable savings, but constantly dreamed of still better things
he seemed to be in a peculiar state of stupid excitement and came toward kolya threatening him with his fist
right behind him came his celebrated defense counsel, fetyukovich, and a subdued hum rose from the audience
who are you talking about then?
what do you mean—i healed her?
besides, how does one go about founding a city or a state?
it's either mine or mr versilov's
obviously, i got a good spanking
i mean it and i say it once and for all
and all i want to say is that your idea of the aristocracy amounts to the rejection of the aristocracy, the prince said
look at him, versilov said
that, too, was influenced by your humanization of mores
then he banged his fist on the table
he called to the valet out in the passage
without going into details, i will only say that the most common method of operation was to find out certain intimate secrets of persons, sometimes quite respectable as well as respected, in order to threaten them with public exposure backed by documentary evidence (which did not always even exist), and to make them pay for discretion
all right, then, give her these three rubles and wrap up, say, ten pies, and tell her to take the package to them
his father, the captain, the back-scrubber, you know, well, he said he’d bring him a pup today, a real mastiff puppy with a black nose
i would always imagined you were one of those young creatures who are aware of their rich endowments and who try to withdraw into themselves
there was sincere concern in her voice, as if she were the closest person in the world to him and was now sharing his grief
besides, all the wardens were used to alyosha
but i don’t think it’s right
but that very same second i saw versilov burst out from behind the door leading into the passage
and why, exactly, are you weeping?
don’t judge me too harshly, alyosha, my friend
this drop in performance was also due in part to that idea, or perhaps, to be more precise, to the conclusions i drew from it, even if they may have been false conclusions
after all, a thirteen-year-old schoolboy doesn’t believe in these things
i also love your cool composure, your calm, smooth, almost lazy way of saying things—yes, it's that very languor that i love
i knew that, after vasin's father had died, stebelkov was the boy's guardian, but that they had not been close for years now, that they had quite different interests and led very different lives
they manage to live their lives out under the most unfavorable circumstances and remain true to themselves even when everything around them has become completely unfamiliar and strange
i don’t want you to think, though, that i’m really a revolutionary extremist
besides, who knows, after all, perhaps such gestures are dictated by the beautiful and sublime ideals inherent in us
and i suppose you’ll stop loving poor silly me once you’ve got to know me better
she must have climbed on a chair and then kicked it out from under her and, to prevent it from banging on the floor, she would put a skirt under it
i do not even understand now how i could have accepted that money from him yesterday, but he appeared so honorable then!
and again, in case of need, he wanted someone to protect him from something unknown but terrifying
no, don’t waste your breath
no, there’s no immortality either
and he’s cunning, with an animal cunning
mitya and the little pole sat at the table opposite each other while the huge pan wrublewski stood nearby, his hands clasped behind his back
the old man rushed to ivan in terror
but, believe me, he realized very well that i knew everything, and also that i was testing him by offering him that money—to see whether he so completely lacked any sense of honor as to accept it
i want ten rubles now so i can pay back one ruble to dolgoruky and use the rest to buy a hat for andreyev
there was nothing wicked or even sarcastic about the stories we told each other that night; they were just funny and made us laugh
he had pushed himself forward, and he had blundered—blundered in a matter involving love and the emotions connected with it
he locked the cupboard, put the key in his pocket, went into the bedroom, lay down exhausted on his bed, and at once fell asleep
i am recounting all this in such detail to show the reader how, despite my frequent vows and solemn resolutions to reform and strive for beauty, i could so easily slip into such vulgarity
is not everybody free to say what he thinks to thin air?
look at his face, oh
mrs prutkov jumped to her feet and snatched the icon from him
i was still there, kneeling and praying, the tears rolling down my cheeks, when suddenly the door opened and there he was again
he kept asking strange and frightened questions, several times even looked at anna with noticeable suspicion
but then the lord said to them: don’t moan because from now on you’ll get the important people
but you must be aware that she's on bad terms with versilov, that and all the rest, so there's nothing so strange about my feeling ill at ease
after that, he quickly made his first move
the blood rushed to my head
the lawyer, fetyukovich, usually charges more, but this case has caused such a sensation across the country and received such detailed coverage in the newspapers and magazines that fetyukovich has taken it on more for personal publicity than for any other reason
so i have decided not to think of it now: let's just try and get hold of the money and once we have it we will see
i don’t know why, but i always say the wrong thing!
here, before we’ve even left
as he used to say himself later, with a nasty snicker: those innocent eyes of hers slit my soul open like a razor
his face was sweating
i suppose it is
sometimes i’d even cry out in the darkness
i’m afraid i did
kolya then went out into the hall and opened the door of the room where the children were
if you look hard enough for what to do, your life wo not last long enough for you to do it!
tell me, what am i to think of that customer?
then let the priest read to the children about the joy of the old patriarch jacob when he learns that his beloved son is alive, about his leaving his native land for egypt and later dying there and announcing before his death the great prophecy that he had concealed throughout his life in his gentle, timid heart—the prophecy that, from his stock, from the hebrews, would come the great hope of the world, who would bring it peace and salvation
but how could i not have stayed with that double in there, that double who had smashed the icon before my very eyes!
he was sure she wouldn’t come, alyosha muttered lamely
if the father manages to give him a satisfactory answer, it is a normal family, a family not based on some mystical prejudice, but founded on reasonable, responsible, and strictly humane premises
but after such a greeting, he stopped and with sly amusement watched ivan dash upstairs and disappear from sight
had you respected him less, you would have demanded less of him and that would have been more like love, for the burden you placed on him would not have been so heavy
but did you say good-by to her?
give it back at once
yet the young man came and installed himself in his father’s house
but he would been highly recommended to me
when had she gone?
it was one of those moments, familiar to most people, that happen only very rarely, perhaps only once in a lifetime
something flashed in the pole’s eyes and it looked as if he had made his decision
a month earlier, that is, one month before september , while i was in moscow, i made up my mind to break off with them all for good and to devote myself entirely to my idea
drunkard and lecher though he was, karamazov was constantly on the lookout for a profitable opportunity to invest some of his capital and, since he was unencumbered by scruples, these ventures were usually quite successful
where did you get those eyes, lisa?
gentlemen of the jury, you must remember that i am a stranger here!
soon after this gregory and martha reported to their master that smerdyakov had suddenly become peculiarly fastidious
versilov snorted in a peculiar way, leaned toward my ear, and, holding onto my shoulder, whispered: he has always lied to you
it was only then that i could scream
i never believed it!
it's only a shame that you happen to be such a nasty little bastard
otherwise he’ll treat me just like any other thirteen-year-old, or even like those other little boys, kolya thought
why, he also knows that i am a little like him in a way
ah, dolgoruky, we all have our memories, you know
but that's just why i have brought you here, he said with an amused smile
to my surprise they did not seem angry with me any longer
are you trying to drag in that cock and bull story about that crazy epileptic idiot, smerdyakov?
i didn’t mean any harm
i, for my part, suddenly became excited out of all proportion (i remember that particular evening very clearly) and cried out:
and, of course, gentlemen, had we found such a shirt among his clothes or in his suitcase—for how could we fail to find it if it existed?—it would be a piece of evidence, something tangible that would have confirmed the suspect’s words
that’s why, i believe, you don’t really realize how thoroughly mr karamazov has been locking himself in at night
some of our respectable people claimed she lived the way she did out of sheer pride, but that didn’t seem to make much sense: she could not pronounce even one word—now and then she would move her tongue about and produce only a mooing sound—so where was there room for pride in her?
there’s nothing in common between us, you idiot!
now, smurov, open the door!
my plan was to dispose of myself at five in the morning
of course, if any intelligent man talked like that, it would be quite another matter!
had you accepted caesar’s purple, you would have founded a universal empire and given men everlasting peace
but i still could not gather up enough courage to disillusion her by telling her frankly that lambert had lied to her, that i would never said a word to him about my devotion to her and, indeed, had never pronounced her name
did anyone concern himself with his education?
so always think of the people and preserve the purity of their hearts
it was a narrow box of a room and the ceiling sloped up from about the height of my shoulder on one side to the opposite end where i could still put the palm of my hand flat on the ceiling
kalganov cried loudly like a young boy hearing something very funny
ah, no, he certainly was not up to that
i ca not think of anything new you would like for a change, mother protested timidly
well, yes, i probably was feverish and, what's more, i was also crying
what are you doing?
then, having settled that, i was determined to say a few words on behalf of anna
they just whip it and drive the poor beast on
do you remember, there's a passage—wait, i will have another glass of champagne first—there's a passage toward the end in which the crazy old man and his charming, thirteen-year-old daughter, after their fantastic escape and wanderings, settle down somewhere in a remote corner of england near some gothic cathedral, and the little girl gets a job as a sort of guide, taking visitors around the church
'because that's how it must be
alyosha was roused before dawn
he had been extremely curious when kolya had told him that he had suddenly decided to go and see ilyusha precisely today
he really horrified our mother and the servants, and me too, for, even though i was just nine years old, i was very frightened when i heard him say that
in the meantime, the moscow lady died and mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters
i told her i was just about to go out, to which she replied again that she would come for no special reason and that she would leave right away
because that’s how she is: she’ll always do the opposite of what one would expect—but i know her through and through!
there was chaos in my head and i probably dozed off very soon
i suppose i came up here too soon—you have not cooled off yet and, besides, you ca not stand being criticized
christ will never hold it against us if we act out of love
he said to me: papa, papa, ah, the way he treated you!
but to make up for it, the more i hate individual people, the more ardent is my general love for mankind
and i didn’t learn of it until three days later, when glafira told me
as soon as smurov did so, kolya whistled
i could not go on
then he again started talking at a tremendous speed, while frantically gesticulating so that i could hardly follow him
so i hope it will not be held against me if i report only what particularly struck me and then stuck in my mind
he has been living in this town for a long time now, working at odd jobs
was it symbolic of something, or what?
outside, in the passage, one climbs on another’s back and in they ride
this sometimes disappointed him a great deal
it met sorrow, wild despair,
no, father, i’m not angry—i know your ideas
he is sick, almost out of his mind, and he’s asking for you
he must have squealed an awful lot because the skin inside a dog’s mouth is, as you know, extremely tender, in fact, much tenderer than the skin in a human mouth, beyond comparison!
luckily my landlord was there too, keeping him company while he waited
but since he could not get the document from me, he resigned himself to working with anna rather than losing all prospect of gain, and that's why he kept offering her his services until the very last moment; he even told her he could deliver a priest for the marriage ceremony if need be, an offer that anna declined with a scornful smile, telling him not to bother
this was not really because he was too embarrassed or too angry with himself—quite the contrary, perhaps—but still, he felt it would not be appropriate for him to attend the party
he went back to the station and returned home, his face white as a sheet
he fired and the bullet just grazed my cheek, scratching my ear slightly
this was where maria kondratiev now lived, old fyodor karamazov’s former neighbor, who used to come to his kitchen for a bowl of soup, and to whom smerdyakov used to sing songs to the accompaniment of his guitar
the poor man’s face looked miserable and frightened
and it was in the servants’ quarters that the boys were found by the rich and eccentric widow of general vorokhov, their mother’s former benefactress
my god, what will happen to them now?
wake up, please, wake up!
by paying him such respect, you acted as if you lacked compassion for him, because you demanded too much of him—and that from you, who love him more than yourself!
matvei was supposed to come any moment now
for a whole week i worried terribly, for fear he would feel embarrassed in front of me for having kept and spent that three thousand
it must be noted, in general, that he was a hot-tempered and rather erratic man
and it had all happened as the result of an inspired idea
it had got to the point where i started avoiding her as much as i could
lambert shouted, really furious now
vanya, vanya went to town,
and now that’s exactly what happened
the white towers and the golden domes gleamed in the sapphire sky
i would have found out what's really going on!
he said, jerking his chair forward so that this time their knees actually bumped
it would also be unnatural if a man who continuously saved and accumulated money, remained constantly alert, watchful, austere, thrifty, and energetic, failed to end up a millionaire
we’ve not been nice to her!
it’s only about nine miles from the volovya railroad station—the road turns to the left there, and you can be in chermashnya in no time
by nature, i’m a very kindly, cheerful person, you know, who can also enjoy all sorts of amusing social farces
indeed, even now as i write i feel a certain pleasure just at the thought of gambling
why were you so frightened that he would see me?
whatever is true and beautiful is always full of forgiveness—the elder used to say that too
it was the portrait of a girl with a thin, consumptive face, but strikingly beautiful
right, right, now everything is coming back to me!
there were probably other lodgers besides lambert in that apartment, i thought, frowning under their stares as i approached them
and he kept mocking him in that most dignified, apologetic way
oh, i, too, i have let myself go unpardonably and am deep in debt too, but i know it's only a temporary lapse
so listen then: legally he doesn’t owe me a thing
after all, he wasn’t afraid to admit that to you, was he, alexei?
he did not budge when he saw me but simply looked at me intently in silence just as i was looking at him, with the only difference that, whereas i stared at him with infinite astonishment, he looked at me without any visible surprise
she, on the other hand, took my outcry calmly without any apparent surprise
all these stories are epitomes of poor taste, but i assure you that this type of bad taste is much more widely spread and deeply rooted than we suspect
listen, if he’d just told you vaguely to say good-by to me on his behalf and to give me his best regards, if he hadn’t insisted as he did on the word regards’—that would have really been the end of everything
i want you to know, though, that on this very day men are convinced that they are freer than they have ever been, although they themselves brought us their freedom and put it meekly at our feet
what you really want is to keep an eye on me here all the time, you spiteful son, and that’s why you don’t want to go
that’s all they are after
how could i think of marrying her if i thought he loved her?
nevertheless, i’ll swallow my tongue rather than offend the venerable old man whom you respect so highly, he said in concluding the letter
you know, i was once bitten by a centipede and was in bed for two weeks with a high fever
of course, it could have been just a coincidence, but it was quite uncanny how he could read my innermost feelings with such a frightening insight and penetration!
it's not to reproach you that i have recalled all this, my beloved sofia, it's only to remind him
ah, i can just imagine that unapproachable, truly dignified, and highly intelligent girl working hand in hand with a guttersnipe like lambert!
so let him in
but this idiot somehow made a very curious observation, one that would have done honor to an infinitely more intelligent observer, and that is why i have brought him in now: of all the sons,  he said, the one who is the most like my master is mr ivan
the twenty years your mother and i have lived together have been spent in silence, he started off in an affected, unnatural tone, and all that passed between us happened without words
and now, why don’t you leave me alone?
but before i even had time fully to register my surprise, i heard sergei's voice: he was talking rather loudly to someone in the corridor
all right,  i say to myself, so i’ll act like a buffoon
besides, god knows it happened completely by accident, and afterward i behaved as decently as was within my power, or at least i stuck as close as possible to the standards of human decency as i conceived them at the time
you do not suppose that i keep such documents at the place where i live, do you?
besides her eyes, i also liked the oval shape of her face, and i believe that, if her cheekbones had been a bit less wide, one might have called her beautiful even now, let alone in her youth
i did not bother to question the nurse, who was an extremely stupid woman, and she was the only adult there
here, mother is giving you back your sixty rubles and another twenty
and he himself burst into tears
and she was wrong about his feelings: he did love his mother and disliked only what he called in his schoolboy lingo that sickening slobbery stuff
she said: you were asleep when he came and he didn’t want to disturb you
so, although i will still start with september , i will first slip in a few words about who i am and where i would been until then, and this will explain, at least in part, what i had on my mind on the morning of september  and make things clearer to the reader, and perhaps also to me
i had been playing for an hour or more already when suddenly i saw sergei get up from his seat
apparently it was because he was going to marry mother
the old man took his eyes off the mirror, walked to the window, and suddenly looked out
why, i’m sure you were talking about me
but you already know all that
no, no, alexei, please don’t say anything, for i have so much to tell you
there were many things that frightened him, and he worried constantly—and this would have made it hard if he had not had someone who was loyal to him—and gregory was as loyal a man as anyone could hope to have
from what you say, i gather he must have taken it for granted that you would not be able to resist the lure of money
from versilov she would inherited perhaps only his slender waist, his tallness, and his characteristic grace of movement
all this made alyosha’s heart bleed and obviously, as i mentioned before, what hurt him most was that the one he had loved more than anybody in the world now stood dishonored and disgraced
the plotnikov store was only two houses away from perkhotin’s, right on the corner of the block
the day declines and is replaced by the stifling, black southern night of seville
please forgive me
indeed, as i mentioned earlier, seeing him so cheerful and talkative, they felt there was a noticeable improvement in his health, even if it was only for a short time
for a whole hour afterward, i sat weeping with my face buried in my hands
and i would know that if i wanted, i would be able to have a better dinner than anyone else that night because i had the best cook in the world, and the awareness of it would be enough for me
shall i tell you why?
snegirev asked with a strange note of fear in his voice
and after that, when they arrested him in mokroye, i understand he declared that he considered the most disgraceful thing in his life the fact that, while he had the money to pay katerina back one half of what he owed her—he specified one half’—and thus not to be an outright thief in her eyes, he preferred to become just that rather than to part with the money
then, by my side, he slipped into an easy, sinless sleep
he did, indeed, and he told me all the facts but quite unemo-tionally
the reader will, of course, notice that i am not sparing myself anything, although i do give myself credit when it is due
and after that you will be free to go and till the soil!
she may not forgive him, even if the child chooses to forgive him himself
however, i preferred the little backstreets and dark alleys to the large lighted squares, because all kinds of unexpected things happen there, because in the filthy gutters i felt i could find natural human gems
and, knowing that, she still wants to marry bjoring?
as you wish
no, they won’t starve, because they’ll get that two hundred rubles, whatever happens
my god, what a dirty trick!
that’s not the important thing i wanted to talk to you about now
and now, suddenly, they both felt as if they had been transported back to the old days in moscow, two years before
and by honoring you without envy, i show you my human dignity
i decided to go and see sergei in the evening so that we could discuss things freely and at length
let's go right away!
besides, even if she had not died, perhaps it would not have worked out
what’s happened to her, anyway?
we should at least apologize for what happened at the elder’s and explain that it was really none of our doing, don’t you think?
my final choice was nikolai semyonovich, who had been my guardian in moscow and was the husband of my dear friend maria
besides, mr dmitry feels that that three thousand is in a way his by right, as he told me himself: i still have three thousand rubles of my money coming to me from my father
you must be raving really, ivan said with a faint, twisted grin, his eyes fastened on alyosha like tentacles
when mitya had left, samsonov, pale with rage, told his son to see to it that that good-for-nothing was never allowed into the house again, otherwise
but she just keeps repeating, if i fancy, i get up; if i don’t
no, no, do not take it back, she replied cuttingly, i feel rather flattered at being the bane of your existence
i want to be able to go back to her and tell her that you are not worrying about her, that you are all right
his views and teachings, uttered at different times and prompted by different circumstances, are gathered and arranged into what is, perhaps, a meaningful whole
'if you are religious,  he would tell them, 'why are not you a monk?
so you see what a bitch i am, i whom you called your sister!
later the prince told me that i would turned so pale that he would been very frightened
still, the hell with it, it’s up to you
but what will i do with this?
grushenka stood up too, but unhurriedly
it would be difficult to explain why he had been so indifferent
he also remembered that he took out of his pocket a new white handkerchief, which he had carefully taken before going to see mrs khokhlakov, and tried senselessly to wipe the blood off gregory’s forehead and cheeks
i am no longer used to stairs
but here comes sergei!
he had heard a lot about him from the boys, but up till now he had always feigned a contemptuous lack of interest and if he said anything it was only to challenge the praises he heard
so he's here, he has not left!
i want to save him once and for all
besides, of course, i’ll give it back
she brought it all on, and that’s the truth!
why do you think i was so anxious to see you just now and these few past days?
after that, the two princes sokolsky had a private five-minute conversation in the old prince's bedroom and, when they emerged, sergei said to me in a loud voice:
but this time i had rubber galoshes on and it proved much harder than i would expected
there are all kinds of peasants, kolya told smurov when they had walked on in silence for a while, so i couldn’t really know in advance that i’d come across a smart one
his face was as white as the sheets of his bed
there are many contemplators among the simple people
something to think about certainly!
and i have also learned that it is not only impossible to live a crook, it is also impossible to die one
i was glad to find something to take his thoughts off those painful things
most of those listening to him were very moved, although some were rather bewildered by his words and found them obscure
but i did feel sad
katerina screamed furiously, losing all control of herself
i had not intended to say that
when, that time, i dozed off for a few seconds, sitting on the edge of his sofa, he immediately felt my pocket and became convinced that the letter was there
mr karamazov had never been a religious man and it may be that until then he had never even placed a five-kopek candle before an icon
in the end he felt sickened by the girls’ songs which, as they became more and more drunk, gradually became more and more outspoken and dirty
besides, god almighty himself, even if he decides to punish the tartar after he dies (since it’s impossible not to punish him at all), would give him only a very small punishment, considering that a tartar cannot be blamed for having been brought into this world by infidel parents
his eyes were completely dry
and before, while he was still in the army, he thought nothing of spending a thousand or two on seducing respectable young ladies; that’s something i’m very well informed about, dmitry, in every detail, and i’ll prove it when the time comes
grushenka, although she offered her hand quite willingly, watched katerina with a charming, nervous little laugh, obviously enjoying having her hand kissed by the lady she addressed as miss katerina
i would forgotten to burn it the day before yesterday
i must not, however, pass over in silence another strange feeling that arose, although only briefly, at that fateful and confusing moment in alyosha’s life
i insist we have bells, though
only, if you start, i’ll have to tell them everything i know, for how else do you expect me to defend myself?
mother cried out in alarm
is there anyone here who would dare to bestow upon her the sacred title of mother?
the righteous man passes away, but his light remains
as though he ever tried to put on an act!
if someone should read what i have written thus far of my adventures, he certainly would not have to be told that i am not well fitted for social life of any kind
alyosha raised his head from the ground and sat up, leaning against a tree
but what i really meant to ask you was this: you stated in your deposition that you were very well acquainted with miss svetlov
and perhaps there will be something more to be said about it
he turned his head slightly and made a sign to the lackey and the doorman
the end of me?
it's the same as ten half-imperials
grushenka got up quickly, looking terribly frightened
my instinctive servility was useful in this case: i tried hard to please him and felt not in the least insulted because i did not understand yet about these things
the story made a very grim impression on the audience and the effect was strengthened by the calm way in which the old servant told it, without any superfluous words and in his own language
although he had been waiting for the servant so eagerly, kolya did not interrupt the performance and kept perezvon dead until he decided it was long enough
but i knew that there were many places he could go now, for he had of late reestablished his connections with petersburg high society, which he had severed during the previous year
i stretched out on the sofa and, staring at his back, thought at length about various matters
i am gripped by a new sensation that i never even suspected existed; i cannot describe it, but it's so powerful, as powerful as the whole world
have a good sleep, i said, and you will see that when you wake up things will look less hopeless
we were still so young then and were still fervently waiting for something
perhaps they will introduce some innovations, and perhaps they wo not
then, on the following day, they quarreled
at first he was going to marry her himself, but he decided not to because she turned out to be lame
why are you telling me all this, ivan?
it's a very urgent matter
it was not that he was afraid of what she might do or anything like that—it just made him stop and think
what this idea of mine actually is, i will have lots to say about later
within myself i’ve renounced my faith—that’s for sure
i’ll show you a trick now, karamazov, a kind of theatrical performance, kolya said with a nervous laugh
in his weak, emotional state, richard kept tearfully repeating again and again: this is the best day of my life, for i am joining the lord!
i hope you won’t laugh at me if i tell you that this question has prevented me from falling asleep for two nights in a row
the little pole kept repeating scornfully, his face the color of a carrot
i believe in his word, toward which the universe is striving, the word that itself was with god’ and that, indeed, is god—well, and so on and so on and on, to eternity; so much has been said on that subject
after the emancipation of the serfs, versilov served as an arbitrator of claims between former serfs and their landlords and, i understand, he performed his duties very well
the gorgeous autumnal flowers in the flowerbeds by the buildings were asleep until morning
what is love to a daughter is death to a mother, and i might just as well be in my grave
for the last time, i tell you: i did not kill him!
i know it isn’t right
oh, it’s you, ivan said coldly
there was something about him that struck her as uncanny; she would never have expected him to behave and speak as he was doing in those circumstances
so i take a few steps in that direction and listen
ivan was attended by dr varvinsky and dr herzenstube, since the moscow doctor had returned to moscow, refusing to commit himself on the probable outcome of the illness
haven’t you had enough nonsense yet?
and behind me there was nothing but disgrace and gregory’s blood now
and that's how it will always be
yes, yes, we will cry
but that is the only reservation i will make out of the hundred-odd that occurred to me
all right, you can have five
her tone showed that she was still terribly afraid that, for some reason or other, they might refuse to listen to her
you are frightening him, the doctor said firmly
the prosecutor then dwelt in great detail on mitya’s preparations for the party, first at perkhotin’s, then at the store, and then with the drivers
and he will also pay me back a debt that does not involve money
obviously this was humiliating and i decided to do something about it
such disorderly behavior in our streets gets unbearable in its ugliness
another great heart belonging to another great being—the heart of his mother—knew that he had not come down only for his great sacrifice but that his heart was open to the simple and artless joys of the plain, uneducated people who had warmly invited him to a humble wedding
now, what else would you like to know?
quite right too, mrs prutkov agreed impetuously
i know i’m unworthy of your generosity, maximov said in a tearful voice; perhaps you’d do better to be generous with people whom you need more than you need me
they’ve all been bribed
now, wouldn’t you agree, for instance, that the christian religion has mainly served the interests of the rich and the powerful by enabling them to enslave the lower classes?
to make at least one fellow creature happy, i mean truly happy, during one's lifetime—i would make that the binding duty of every civilized person, just as i would make it the binding duty of every russian peasant to plant at least one tree in his lifetime to counteract the deforestation of russia
in fact, i’ve never seen two men get along so famously!
and he is sorry for her for a long time and then he gets attached to her so that it becomes impossible for him to break it off, my boy, if you see what i mean
my god, madam, you’ve saved my life!
her pale, sallow face was contorted, her eyes were afire
i arrived at the address, entered the yard, and, following the instructions in the advertisement, found mrs lebrecht's apartment
and this is especially true in our age, in which you have managed to change so many things for the worse
he seemed terribly wound up
but please forgive me, lisa, i am talking like a fool because i know that i am offending you, i realize that
cold shivers ran down my spine as i listened to her
so he was lying to me shamelessly!
i will follow you wherever you go, i said, giving myself to him totally
i seized my cap and rushed toward my overcoat
do you remember my coming back for the second time that night, around midnight, when i told you to remember my second visit?
it had started when i was sixteen
no, no, i still do not know!
i will save you all, but i will do it my way, as i explained to you before
he needs some rest
you should have seen his eyes—he was so proud
he said, turning again to ilyusha
he gave vent to his irritation quite freely, especially at dinner, and, in general, behaved like a real despot
well, that’s very possible, gentlemen!
but this time i somehow felt an acute pity for her
that's none of your business
i saw you often at countess verigin's last year, darzan said
now if you do not get the boy's likeness at all or if you get it just a little bit, i will still pay you fifty rubles, but if the likeness is really good, i will come up with a whole two hundred
i stood up and said cuttingly that, under these circumstances, i could not accept any money from him, that i would probably been either deliberately or unintentionally led to believe by my family that a salary was to be paid to me so that i would not turn the job down at once; however, i appreciated perfectly well now that no salary should be forthcoming since i had done nothing here to earn it
it's funny, i have always been crazy about nuts, ever since i was a small child, and i still am—the most ordinary nuts too
i was trotting be-hind him, for i was afraid of the gun he was still clutching in his right hand; he would forgotten all about it, and it was awfully close to her head
what makes you think i am one of you?
have you ever asked him whether he believes that?
as a matter of fact, only tatyana prutkov and i ever speak of katerina around here, and at that only in secret
these spoiled society ladies, when they get an idea into their heads, won’t spare a thing to see their whims realized
i have been—if i may put it this way—a martyr for honor, a kind of diogenes going about with a lantern and looking for honor in the dark
what i most wanted to find out was about those chains he was supposed to have worn and that's why i kept insisting
wait, karamazov, perhaps you’ll find out something in a moment
and then on the way home you would get so tired that i would have to carry you and you would fall asleep in my arms
the hell with all this spying on the human heart!
mitya became terribly frightened
some may object that he was drunk when he wrote it, but that changes nothing; if anything, it makes it more important: when drunk he wrote something that he had decided when he was sober, for if he had not conceived the idea when he was sober, he would not have written it down when he was drunk
by the way, i was struck at once by the friendly familiarity with which makar and the doctor talked to each other, and it did not please me at all
and for my part, i can guarantee that sum, for which i am so infinitely grateful to you, and i would like to offer you the following plan, which
such judgments found among the people are sometimes striking in their originality!
why couldn’t it have actually happened?
overwhelmed by disgust, i jumped up from the sofa
but she did not cry, proud as she was: instead, it made her indignant, my story
he waited quietly for a minute and then walked stealthily across the lawn, keeping close to the trees and bushes, muffling each step and constantly listening to make sure he made no noise
in short, a most chaotic and absurd party was under way
just imagine that, and i won’t repeat the horrid phrase they used!
i shall report you all!
he snatched up a fork and stuck it into my leg
charity is part of his aristocratic tradition, or perhaps he even has a personal inclination for it
and so i walk and i imagine i see her
that wild question clutched at his heart
but he had heard about the sixth thousand and admitted that he had been standing next to mitya when mitya said it
on the third day after the arrest, grushenka had been taken ill, and she was very ill for almost five weeks
why did you do that, vanya?
perhaps a whole constellation
but enough of this
had you been willing to give them bread, you would have satisfied the eternal craving of both individual man and human society as a whole—to have someone to worship
what infuriated me most was all these idiotic secrets and intrigues, without which these people apparently could not live
miusov gazed abstractedly at the graves in the churchyard and was about to remark that the dead had to pay a very high price for the privilege of being buried in this holy place, but he let it pass, for his usual ironic liberal tone was turning into something like anger
when alyosha entered, she too gave him a look of unconcealed disgust
you were really full of appreciation
for heaven's sake, do not tell me, there's no need
versilov rushed after me
he said in a gentle tone
she still had not quite taken hold of herself
some phrase, is not it?
he stopped going to his mill, stopped listening to people
ivan cried, flaring up again
it was he who told it to me
yes, as of today, i shall never abandon him!
in the end, of course, the gate was opened
i must ask you once more, gentlemen, to excuse me if i refuse to discuss this subject any further, miusov repeated
i sensed that it was some external shock that had caused his present expansiveness with me
b-but how would that be possible?
that is, if he had the money to take her away with
it took my breath away to think about it
i can’t with these people
i would seize his hands and i would find the right words in my heart
the old man, a most astute businessman, was (he has been dead for some time now) quite a personality himself
this has been tested
that's what her behavior with me was like
so number two becomes number one and number one becomes number two
well, i guess i’ll be going
the foul quagmire in which he was sinking of his own volition made him sick and, like so many others under such circumstances, he believed in the magic of a change of place—just to get away from this spot, to be surrounded by different people, to be in a different situation, where everything would be new and different!
there are secrets with nothing criminal or even sinful about them whose exposure may terrify the most honorable and even strong-minded people
the devil himself will trip over his own feet
the bed next to his was occupied by a tradesman who was swollen with dropsy and was obviously not going to live more than two or three days, so he could hardly be a serious hindrance to their conversation
tell me, perkhotin, would you be interested in gold mining?
that’s not what i want—i feel gay and i want you to be gay
but that's fine with me, i will leave you since i ca not force you to like me
i said it deliberately, to offend him, for he had never, never once, tried to convince me that dmitry was the murderer; on the contrary, it was i who kept telling him that!
it is the most terrible moments of their lives that people remember best
you’ve come to see me and you despise me in my own house
i hope you will forgive me this trivial simile, fetyukovich went on, because i am not very good at elegant phrasemaking
if you really have something
the next day the doctor came and said we had sent for him too late; when i begged him, perhaps with a tinge of reproach, to do something, he gave me that final majestic excuse: i am not god, after all, am i?
i recognize his love for mankind as an absolutely sincere and profound feeling, without any pretense, and his love for mother as something beyond dispute, albeit perhaps somewhat implausible
kill him if you wish
the washing operations began
but never mind, we’ll catch up
so isn’t it in a way the same thing—in a different form, of course?
anyway, they had to have a scapegoat, so they made me write my column of criticism and that made life possible
look how pretty he is, grushenka said, taking mitya to him
ah, my sweet little alyosha!
i know i can’t express it properly, but i’ll say it all the same, alyosha went on in the same trembling, faltering voice
they all say he will be acquitted while the other man, stebelkov, will be found guilty
it’s amazing, though—i used to consider you an educated man
i have been preparing myself to speak up for three years
so you see, i’m going to chermashnya
i can see that right away
i confess that i did feel a slight buzzing in my head from the three glasses of champagne and two glasses of sherry i would drunk
this he did when the prosecutor mentioned grushenka and what rakitin thought of her
by the way, in moscow not long ago, a bulgarian told me, ivan went on, ignoring alyosha’s remark, of the atrocities committed all over his country by turks and circassians, who, fearing a general uprising of the slav population, set villages afire, rape women and children, nail their prisoners to fences by the ears and leave them in that state until morning, when they hang them, and who commit other atrocities that are difficult even to imagine
i do not understand that reasoning—it's too abstract for me, i went on
good, i’m glad you did
he and alyosha were good friends
you cannot imagine how impudent he was, alyosha
and here he added parenthetically that if there was any natural law, it was precisely this: destroy a man’s belief in immortality and not only will his ability to love wither away within him but, along with it, the force that impels him to continue his existence on earth
suddenly the gun flashed through the air: he would swung at her with it
so now, alyosha, that you know the whole truth, you can see what a frantic, violent creature i am!
they immediately became silent when they saw me
even if he walks away unmoved by your embrace, laughing at you, do not let it deter you; it only means that his time has not yet come—and it will come in due course
but when i got close to my mother's house, i suddenly remembered the wicked things lisa had said about anna
i yelled, spitting out the words, syllable by syllable
when he removed the wrapping, ivan saw that it contained three rolls of rainbow-colored hundred-ruble bills
why did you turn that way?
he walked up and down the room, looking worried
but she’s kind and wonderful and generous, she said in a half whisper
i’m not leaving yet, kolya quickly said to ilyusha
and why don’t you dare?
as to his prisoner, he may have been struck by the man’s looks
you’re a lousy little crook, that’s what you are!
somehow i believe that there is a great deal of corruption in america too
now, that does it!
so who told me something about spiritualism?
ah, so you think so too?
ah, quelle charmante personnel what do you think?
what we heard during her last appearance on the witness stand was not testimony, but the frantic outcry of a resentful and vengeful woman
ivan recognized her writing at once
of course, we shall not repeat here what the reader already knows
i somehow feel rather sick and tired of everything today
he shouted after his son
that, of course, caused a terrible commotion
but then one day, when smerdyakov was fifteen, karamazov noticed that he was reading the titles of the books through the glass of the bookcase
i was not jealous because i was so happy at the time; in fact, this difference rather pleased me
that’s true, he said with a smile, a bitter smile, though
it was said that our prosecutor, ippolit kirillovich, was terrified of fetyukovich and that they had been old enemies since the days in petersburg when they were starting out on their careers
that’ll add to the stinging effect,  he declares and proceeds to use them on the little girl
ivan was puzzled again
i guess i must have picked it up somewhere or other
yes, i had something in mind before, but things are changed; it’s quite different now
and then one day the family of the accused approached me and asked me to handle his defense
it looks as if we shall
probably smerdyakov was one of them; most likely he, too, was eagerly collecting the sensations he experienced, although hardly aware of it himself
there’s something i’ll tell you tomorrow
well, i do not know whether her words really apply to all idealists, but i am sure they fit him perfectly
it sounded as if rakitin knew a great deal, as if he had seen everything, been everywhere, spoken to everybody, was familiar with every detail of fyodor karamazov’s life story and, indeed, of the life stories of all the karamazovs
she had been quite upset by mitya’s visit and felt that she would not escape the migraine from which she usually suffered after a commotion of that kind
without having the sense to count them, i scooped up my bills and gold into the palms of my hands
i see him every day, and every time he surprises me
of course, it was sheer coincidence
please take in what i am saying, andrei, for i did want to come and see you now; you have always been and still are infinitely dear to me
but why should anna get it into her head that you might want to marry katerina?
why am i in such a hurry, though?
what are you trying to say?
when it comes to coffee, pies, and fish soups—my smerdyakov is a real artist
never before had katerina made such admissions to alyosha
i was in a great hurry, that day, to get to a diplomatic reception given by a prominent petersburg lady, who was trying to get a ministerial post for her husband
recently, just since i came to petersburg, certain railroad shares were put on the market and the people who bought them made quite a handsome profit, for some time the shares kept rising
the righteous, the saints, the holy martyrs—they were all happy people
indeed, something quite incredible was taking place in the cell
besides, all that is de l'inconnu, but i do think it was quite improper for a gentleman
there i would meet versilov's son, who had just arrived from petersburg and was staying with prince v, a friend of his from boarding school days
it is late at night, it is dark, and he is mad with jealousy
i would rather go on working, papa, i would not feel right without it
as if conscious of his subordinate and dependent position, of not being their equal, he did not greet the visitors
the elder zosima lives in the hermitage, he lisped
everything i have to say you already know—i can read it in your eyes
you have heard, have not you, about those people, you know?
and my coat's in the hall
worse than that, they do not even bother to hide from their children their great delight at their sudden discovery of the right to dishonor that will enable them to satisfy their greed, a right based on a certain species of reasoning accepted wholesale by so many
but why bother analyzing feelings?
the next day i sent smurov to inform ilyusha that i was no longer talking to him, which meant that our relations were broken off
the doctor waved his hand impatiently in front of his face
oh, in the absurd, carefree, irresponsible state of mind i was in at the time, i could have wiggled out of this difficulty by some noble gesture, by some high-sounding phrase, or something of that sort, had i not suddenly noticed the angry, accusing look under lisa's frown
later, karamazov swore he had left with the rest of the gang, and it may have been quite true: no one has ever known for sure
but let us leave it for the time being
he even married off his hall porter's daughter
as a matter of fact, he spoke of practically nothing else
the best feelings i’m capable of, such as gratitude, are forbidden to me, just because of my official social position
that man was locked inside me, but he would never have come out if it hadn’t been for this terrible blow of fate
and i want you to note that he wouldn’t be hurting mitya; indeed, mitya would be indebted to him for as long as he lived
i started accumulating some capital
the birds had quieted down and now and then a fish would splash in the water
arkady, how well do you know mamma?
he understood that it would be too painful for someone like mitya to find himself suddenly surrounded by thieves, swindlers, and murderers, and that he ought to be given a chance to get used to them
he hadn’t expected financial assistance from any quarter, and such a substantial sum was beyond his wildest dreams
it was just by accident
you do pray before going to sleep, do not you?
i am not sure i can make it clear, but his whole being was outraged that such a thing could have happened to him
and even if this should not happen till the end of time, happen it will because it has been so ordained
then, i suddenly let go and fell down on the floor
and you, mother, do you remember coming to the village where i lived until the age of six or seven?
then he went in for philanthropy on a large scale, donated an immense amount of money to charities in our town, became known in the capitals, and was elected to national charity committees in moscow and in petersburg
for, although those who had gathered around him that evening knew that death was near, they never thought it would be so sudden
oh, there’s nothing much to tell really
the little pole looked very bored
for it would be an artistically convincing picture of a russian illusion, but an illusion that really existed until some people decided that it had never been anything but an illusion
did you get that, by any chance, from that father paisii of yours?
and that made it all the more difficult for him to give her the message he had for her
in that sense, i am just like mr versilov
yes, because even if the court doesn’t believe what i’ve said to you today, the public will believe it and you’ll feel ashamed
but at times something seemed to come over him: he would question god's existence and say all sorts of very strange things, obviously challenging me to answer him
do not do anything horrible to yourself, god forbid
a little vertical line had appeared between her eyebrows, which gave her beautiful face a look of thoughtful concentration and, at first glance, made it appear almost austere
what about his opinion that you were so terribly anxious to hear?
i was like a gambler who intends to place a stake but, before doing it, feels: if i want to, i will put it down; if i want to, i can walk out
that more than anything else will make you reconsider many things
but even if gregory is alive, even so
i come from a small monastery, st sylvester in obdorsk, the visiting monk said in a humble tone, watching the hermit out of quick, curious, and somewhat frightened eyes
so all of them had to gather in makar's room just when i least wanted to see them!
now he took a step toward me
you’ll pay me back some day
i certainly hope he won’t—that would really be the last straw!
most probably, he was absolutely sincere in his generous impulse in the first instance, and just as sincere in his villainy in the second
in the course of his life, he came in contact with some of the most liberal minds of his era, both in russia and abroad
he yelped and jumped, begged and walked on his hind legs, lay on his back with his paws pointing at the ceiling, stretched himself out motionless as if he were dead
your money or your life!
you should be able to get up with it, lisa suggested impatiently
so you are leaving town again?
what can i think of these people after this?
maria, the daughter of the landlady, was wearing a light blue dress with a six-foot train
that’s no carp for you!
but look, see for yourselves, it tells you everything in advance, and when he actually did kill his father, he followed it point by point—it contains his whole program!
i yelled, trying to shake them off
she stood there with a terrified expression holding her clasped hands in front of her
they will also discover that men can never be free because they are weak, corrupt, worthless, and restless
as i sat by his bed one night, he said to me: papa, when they fill my grave, i want you to scatter some bread crumbs on top of it, so the sparrows will come and i’ll have company there and it will be fun!
i’m the first to love him
she went on exclaiming
his father, because earlier in life he had scrounged off other people, had developed a special sensitivity to people’s attitudes and was prepared to interpret anything as a personal slur
but what the hell, i really can’t stay here and be their keeper
but all their aspirations came to nothing; some of those who sought her favors had to beat an undignified retreat and became the butt of general jokes, for she had a special firm and mocking way of rejecting unwanted advances
you’re spitting now, you pole, mitya said in despair, realizing that he had failed, because you reckon that you’ll be able to get more out of grushenka—you’re a couple of capons, that’s what you are!
the first room after the entry was packed with people, perhaps as many as thirty persons, half of whom were busy bargaining while the rest looked like auction lovers, mrs lebrecht's representatives, and just plain curious passers-by
is that all there is?
that’s not at all what you said a little while ago, katerina whispered barely audibly, not at all
we were already in the street by the time i would uttered the last disconnected sentences
the elder turned suddenly to look attentively at alyosha, who then walked over to lise and, smiling awkwardly, gave her his hand
but it would be easier for me to imagine a hell without a ceiling—that would be more refined, more enlightened, more lutheran, that is
please, any other time, he muttered
le grand dadais literally tore the money out of his hand:
they roasted the nightingale and brought it to the merchant
they all lost their heads; they had a whole to-do about it in the city council
indeed, we are even obsessed—yes, obsessed—with the most noble ideals, if, that is, we happen to stumble on such ideals by chance, if they fall into our laps from the sky, and as long as we don’t have to pay for them
the chilly evening air refreshed him
fyodor karamazov, he could have conceivably done it for money, namely, to take the three thousand rubles that he had seen his master put into the envelope
and they filled them up to the brim
versilov lives in litvinov's house, which is on mozhaisk street, near the semyonovsky regiment barracks
it was closed all the time i was in the garden, up to the moment i ran away
she sent for me and i must go and see her now, alyosha said, getting up determinedly
and to think that this was the only time in my life i tried my hand at it!
true, i always want to get my revenge whenever i am insulted, morbidly so perhaps, but only by overwhelming my offender with my magnanimity
the boys at school were the most insulting of all
yes, i am sure anna wants me to be there!
perhaps it was because he was so disgusted by the monstrousness and the horror of his rivalry with his own father over this woman that, at the time, he could not imagine anything worse or more threatening
i had carefully made a bundle of the most indispensable things to take with mo
and you saw those chains yourself, did you?
mitya greeted those he already knew with a hug, trying hard to remember whether he had seen some of the faces before
so how could you tell me in advance exactly when you would fall down those cellar stairs in an epileptic fit, unless you were planning to sham it?
ah, don’t start philosophizing now, you fool!
come into the other room with me
a person who's not concerned with russia's present is not a worthy citizen
well, do not you think that was quite a shrewd appraisal of my character?
we’d put mother and the girls in the buggy and cover them with blankets, and the two of us would walk alongside; now and then he would climb into the carriage too, for a ride and a rest, while i would have to walk all the way, because we had to think of the horse
and why should he soak his handkerchief in the blood of this new victim, thus leaving one more clue that may lead to him?
what is this about the state being eliminated and the church raised to the status of a state!
how dare he ask me those questions?
so how can you break the engagement if she doesn’t want it broken?
the long-legged one growled suddenly
the visitor prostrated himself before the holy man and asked for his blessing
there’s nothing more to explain—you’ll find the rest out for yourself
it was not true
but, in the first place, this letter was written by someone who was very drunk and in a state of great nervous tension
the prosecutor intervened, repeating once more to mitya that he did not have to answer any questions if he thought that not answering them would be to his advantage, etc, etc
she has the bearing of a lady of the highest society, he once blurted out in the presence of some ladies
and he was suddenly seized by such an irresistible urge to speak to fenya, to find out as much as he could from her, that he abruptly turned around and walked quickly toward the house of mrs morozov, grushenka’s former landlady
i just remember that i suddenly felt an overwhelming desire: i could climb up on top of the wall, i could do it very easily, i said to myself when, only a few steps away from me, i discovered a gate that probably remained locked for months on end
miusov, too embarrassed to go on, was about to walk out of the room
for he would immediately be offered food and shelter; and if no one offered him anything, he would find everything he needed right away himself, and it would cost him no effort, nor make him feel in the least humiliated, nor, for that matter, would he be imposing himself on others; just the contrary, they would all be only too happy to do things for him
don’t you realize he’s gone mad?
lambert asked from behind the screen
who am i to bless them?
i had seen her three or four times while i was living in moscow when she turned up from god knows where and, on someone's instructions, arranged things for me—to get me into touchard's school and two and a half years later to have me transferred to high school and installed in the house of the late nikolai semyonovich
yes, a maniac, a maniac!
i kissed her, and let me add parenthetically that since that day mrs prutkov and i have always remained pretty good friends
i saw clearly that mr perkhotin had interfered with his plans, for i think that mr rakitin was about to tell me something after he had read me his poem
suppose the boy was bitten by a rabid dog and then goes around biting other people
what time was it?
she turned away from him without answering
he indulged in sweet things; he liked to have his tea with the cherry jam that was sent him by rich ladies
also i still do not believe that you are telling me the truth even now
there have been many great nations with a glorious past history, but the higher the stage of development they reached, the greater was their discontent, because they became more and more obsessed with the need for universal unification
the organ that was playing, the people who were drinking and eating around me, and the bleak lighting have probably left a mark on my soul that will be there as long as i live!
were you hoping to find me changed then?
alyosha stood up and walked over to rakitin
ivan came in very, very slowly, his head down, and not looking at anyone, as though he were trying hard to work something out
that’s what i’m afraid of
there are times when i must sound terribly immature and that’s because, when i’m pleased about something and don’t restrain myself in time, i’m likely to say heaven knows what
despite her fear of him, which i have also noticed, she's always had a great trust and admiration for his code of behavior and his high-mindedness, ever since they first met
this is no place for me, he thought to himself
i am forced to maneuver cunningly to avoid the snares set for me by that unspeakable woman, and i find it all absolutely unbearable!
they wish god did not exist
here i’ve written you a love letter
from my ravings, disconnected utterances, mutterings, and exclamations, lambert learned all the exact names, family names, and even sometimes the addresses he needed
my only wish is to have my fill of looking at you all
so the rooms were familiar and the waiters recognized me as an old customer
on the previous night, however, i would heard my mother whispering to my sister, so versilov would not hear (not to worry andrei), that she intended to take to the pawnshop an icon which, for some reason, was particularly dear to her
if you want to do something to help him, do it!
they would then force the crazy gallop of our unbridled passions to a stop in the name of their own salvation, in the name of enlightenment and civilization!
rumor had it that you were looking for juchka and that you’d come with him as soon as you’d found him
how can anyone judge him?
he had not expected the boy’s face to have grown so thin and yellow, or his eyes to look so huge and to burn so feverishly, or his hands to seem so brittle
kolya slapped his hand on the blanket and perezvon was there beside ilyusha
sounds like a lot of nonsense
it is also true, though, that this well-tested, thousand-year-old method of spiritual regeneration from slavery to freedom and moral perfection may prove to be a double-edged weapon, for some men, instead of gaining humility and ultimate self-mastery, may acquire the most satanic pride, so that they are fettered rather than free
alyosha stood up, ready to leave
there was a kitchen in the main house, but he disliked the smell of cooking, so his food had to be carried across the yard all year around, summer and winter
such outbursts are not so very unusual
but i hardly paid any attention to it
what other reason could he have had for coming here?
extending his conquest over nature beyond all bounds through his will and his science, man will constantly experience such great joy that it will replace for him his former anticipation of the pleasures that await him in heaven
there were many things that made us hate each other, katya, but i swear to you, i loved you while i hated you, but you did not love me!
right you are, the landlord said, that was exactly what they decided to do; montferrant, who was building st isaac's cathedral, said: 'break it up and then cart the pieces away
and yet, i don’t know what to think of her anymore
do you forgive me?
mr karamazov either did not see or did not want to see the wickedness, but responded in kind, grinning back
nothing, nothing will bring him back now, i know it, he cried sorrowfully
did not you see how he was melting from sheer joy
but, for certain special reasons, he decided to treat you with indulgence since inquiries were made and it was found that once you had belonged to decent society and had even served in the guards but that later you had been ostracized and that your reputation was, to say the least, dubious
possibly he even viewed that first lover’ as a sort of fictional character
he is sick now and bedridden, but nevertheless, he is pretty sure to see that she lacks nothing, whatever happens
i could work on it for years, and finally, out of that infernal den, a soul would emerge that was noble for having known suffering
yes, i’m referring to you, mr miusov
that morning, before lapsing into sleep, the elder had told him: i shall not die before enjoying one more talk with you, my dear ones, before once more looking at your dear faces and once more pouring out my soul to you
go and find out
i decided that he would mistaken lambert for anna's brother, but, just as if he would thrust his eyes inside my soul, he added: no, sir, it was not lambert, it was her real brother, the young mr versilov—an army ensign, i believe
but how could i suspect that it would end up in murder?
perhaps that’s exactly what happened between them, alyosha suddenly thought
say, don’t you think it was very clever, the way they caught up with him in mokroye?
during the summer there was talk of taking him abroad for a cure, but mrs prutkov decided there was no need for that
as to trishatov, i have been out of touch with him since that day, although i am still trying to trace him
so it shall be and so be it!
i have also mentioned tatyana's strange weakness for that woman and her reluctance to fire her
he did not know why he was hugging the earth, why he could not kiss it enough, why he longed to kiss it all
she turned and again vanished behind the heavy curtain, so quickly that alyosha didn’t even have time to answer her, although he had things to say to her
it is useful morally and, even more so, politically
i also marveled at his face
he’ll die today, alyosha said
however, i definitely deny that he was ever really insane, especially since today he may be described as anything but insane
they don’t just say that, they even have it in writing, at least the jesuits have
what did it say?
all right, i will take your bet, he said in a dry and stern tone
and you, alyosha, don’t you forget to tell mitya that i sent them those pies
and that’s just what i want: i’d like to get there and be punished
so you came here to conquer hearts, take elegant society by storm, and avenge yourself on god knows whom for being illegitimate?
grushenka shouted at the top of her voice
what amazes me most is not even your intelligence but the mere fact that a man of your integrity, a man so infinitely superior to me, can walk next to me and talk to me with such friendly simplicity as if nothing unpleasant had ever happened
you know, we go in more for beating, flogging, whipping—that’s more to our national taste
by the way, ilyusha, did you know he just got married to that miss mikhailov?
he was too delicate anyway: it would been more than he could take
listen to me, you miserable dog!
and so, acting jointly with his double, he picked up the icon and smashed it in two!
please tell me what you think of him
what makes you think it’s something that concerns you, though?
she measured me with her eyes as a strange smile played on her lips, apparently she was calculating something
i noticed it only later, all of a sudden, but for about a month he’d been coming to see me almost every day, although i’d known him for quite a long time even before that
now let me make a confession to you, karamazov, so that you’ll know from the start what kind of a person i am
you know, curiously enough, as i was looking at you inside there, while you were telling some story, i suddenly thought you must be overly suspicious and sensitive
if you want, i’ll come and see you tomorrow, for there are many things for us to talk about, but for now, good-by
this does not mean i am trying to compare myself with columbus, and if anyone infers anything of that sort, he should be ashamed of himself
sounds stupid, sir
tell me, rather, how long will you stay here?
the pretty boy explained that bologne was her lap dog
the spectators roar with joy because the child torturer has been acquitted
but your heart is better than your head
i suppose it shows that a good half of my soul was still occupied by a child
isn’t that a poem in itself?
fathers and teachers, the elder then said, turning to his visitors with a warm smile, never until this day, not even to him, have i revealed why the face of this youth is so dear to my heart
and before the girl, paralyzed with terror, could answer him, he threw himself down at her feet
when the general’s widow died not long after, she bequeathed a thousand rubles to each boy to be spent exclusively on his education, but sparingly, so that it should last until their coming of age
it only cost one ruble, and it was not your ruble
well, it won’t fall apart in two days, your venice, i promise you!
came the voice of the nonentity again
there is hardly anything personal in them
it is mr perkhotin, isn’t it?—generally speaking, i do not believe in miracles, but this time, with that icon, it’s really amazing!
oh, my god, my god!
and it is not at all that men afflicted with jealousy are necessarily mean and dirty-minded
how are things with her now?
and what about the cellar?
they called out to him, die in the lord, because his grace has descended upon you too!
i muttered something breathlessly, but i was no longer afraid to look into her face
there's mystery in every tree, in every blade of grass
so you will come with us, for i wo not let you out of my sight now
well, he’s still quite cheerful, but now he’s liable suddenly to start pacing the room, shaking his head, and twisting the hairs on his right temple with his finger
no, enjoy isn’t the right word—i’m sort of enthusiastic about it, you understand?
then, in a fit of morbid depression, caused by the combination of his epilepsy and the terrible disaster that had struck his house, smerdyakov hanged himself
and that was the last i ever saw of her, for she died three years later, having spent the time in between missing her two sons and being wretched without them
smerdyakov, come here, smerdyakov
i lay thinking such thoughts, with my face buried in the pillow for i don’t know how long
i took things for granted then, without questioning
she had another fit of hysterics: she fell to the ground, sobbing and screaming
and even that’s not the whole story
perhaps you can tell me, though, how many fingers you have on your hand?
the thought that versilov had not bothered to tell me this struck me as very strange, and i immediately thought: if he did not tell me, he may very well not have told mother either
now that's more than i will take from you, i said and started walking toward the door, but before i had even reached it he called:
it was the first time i would kissed her
she opened it and pulled out a blank sheet of notepaper
but after many violent explosions of sobs and hysterics, she started to talk and then even spoke eagerly as i listened to her with interest
i’ve always wanted to stay on good terms with a woman after breaking off with her
i took a good look around
and i want you to note the sentence where he writes: i’ll kill him provided ivan leaves
in that case, i am moving out this evening
that’s not the same thing!
i will admit, however, that, until today, i have hesitated to think that this was a planned and premeditated murder
so why are you all dressed up then?
but if you would rather not, i will open the door for you at once
for another woman it would be wrong, but for you it is right
and, by the way, was it cutlets and peas that you ordered this morning?
but she is wrong
heads that will not cerebrate,
you could kill him that way
this gentleman wore a thin topcoat, stained and patched
i had been prepared for anything except these words from her, whom i thought i knew so well
listen then: we are not with you, we are with him—and that is our secret, our mystery!
katerina, although apparently frightened, still managed to behave with composure, her attitude expressing a mixture of scorn and surprise
that talented young man, mr rakitin, whom i have already mentioned, characterized that fatal woman in the following few phrases: early disappointment, betrayal, and fall, desertion by the man who seduced her
but the lucidity that had flared up in me for a moment dimmed quickly
because there certainly must be such wild places there too
they have got a gun!
but, then, i once knew a young lady of the old, romantic generation who, after several years of secret love for a gentleman whom, please note, she could have peacefully married at any moment she chose, invented insurmountable obstacles for herself and, one stormy night, jumped from a steep, rather cliff-like bank into a fairly deep, rapid river and drowned, all because she fancied herself an ophelia out of shakespeare
people in town knew very little of her past history and what they did know was vague and uncertain
at the very moment i started seeing grushenka, i stopped being katerina’s fiancé and stopped being an honorable man
listen, kids, i’m in trouble, kolya started in a serious tone
then, as he explained afterward, it was as if something had hit me on the head
listen, alyosha said, she’s coming
mother was ashen also, but in her case it was from fear
but perhaps, after having listened to 'lucia,  he will go and kill bjoring
but i didn’t dare argue with mr dmitry, who decided for some reason to make me his watchdog, so to speak
clever or not, i’m a little taken aback by the fuss you’re making about poor dear alexei’s finger
but let me try to describe everything in logical sequence, although there was, of course, not much logic in me at the time
mother said, shaking her head appreciatively
when the doctor came—an old german called eisenschmidt—markel would ask him: tell me, doctor, will i be one more day in this world?
mitya then turned abruptly, sat astride his chair, and swung his arm: here, that’s how i hit him!
we didn’t get engaged right away, not for three months after her visit
from what i gathered from versilov directly when he let himself go once, they used to hide in corners, wait for each other on the stairs, bounce away from each other red-faced when someone went by; and many a time the tyrannical landowner would tremble at the sight of any lowly servant scrubbing the floors despite all his seignorial rights!
i see that sometimes it exasperates you too that a thought refuses to let itself be molded into words
by sheer chance, her two maids had slipped unnoticed out of the house, without permission, to attend some birthday party down the street
she almost pushed him out of the room
her gaiety was contagious and alyosha felt its effect
so he wants me to keep a look-out for her until after midnight
here i will note parenthetically that much later i learned that bjoring had suggested to katerina that she somehow or other convince her father to go on a trip to europe with her, meanwhile letting the rumor be spread in petersburg society that he had become completely mentally irresponsible, and have him certified as such by doctors abroad
fetyukovich seemed slightly taken aback
but let me remind you of one thing, mr karamazov: you said yourself a moment ago that we had promised to behave decently while we are here, and i’d like you to remember it
without saying a word, he stared at me through his pince-nez and started examining me
he says that and he knows
mitya allowed them to write it down without saying a word
many people heard him say so and, also, that one day he would find enough money to carry out his plan
i have heard, i tried again, that mr stebelkov's affairs are not in very good shape these days
i see, i see
at that moment, he didn’t even want to go on living: what’s the point?
grushenka had done so to torment him, in one of her wicked moments, but, to her considerable surprise, dmitry had shown very little interest in it
i inevitably said something i should not have
but i have no wish to be holy
and all of a sudden i felt terrible about behaving like that: why, she's probably the one person in the world i really love and she's the one i am trying to hurt the most!
and what about you?
and i’ll be able to bring you as much gunpowder as you want
gradually that feeling of despondency led to illness; his nerves became really shattered; and, instead of his stay in tsarskoe being profitable to his health, it had weakened him to such a point that he almost had to take to his bed
very recently, however, she told me she had made up her mind to enter a convent
but please follow me closely in case i get mixed up, for i feel a bit dizzy
do not you dare, do not you dare!
especially when his dear papa is a drunken and unscrupulous lecher who never knows just how far he can go
i had known my documents were not quite in proper order
there was a quiver in it and a certain ring that was new to me; it was as if someone else had spoken
now he had witnessed it himself
he hurried to town so that he could attend as quickly as possible to everything he had to do there and get back as soon as he could
i met agafia, with whom i had remained on friendly terms
they were alone in a smallish garden
the little monk listened to their conversation in silence
i suspect, though, that the truth lies somewhere between that sacred ideal and the outright lie
and that's why i must not stay alone—that's as obvious as two times two is four, is not it?
i’m not good as you said i was, and that’s the truth
i can hear you thinking: he’s on a binge again!
the boy is bound to ask himself: did he love me when he begot me?
he quickly looked all around him, went up very close to alyosha, who was standing in front of him, and started whispering to him with an air of great mystery, although there was absolutely no danger of anyone’s overhearing them
why should not i have a sumptuous mansion, receive the best people, and exert my influence?
no, you aren’t laughing, you’re angry again
in that other town, you know
how could the accused have managed to leave the bed quite undisturbed, especially since his hands were covered with blood at the time?
hey, stebelkov's here too!
finally the boy let his finger go, jumped back to a safe distance as before, and waited
i did not catch what you said, i was in such a hurry to get here on time
just listen to him!
we understand very well, the prosecutor said drily, that the statement you have just made is the result of your irritation with us, your exasperation at questions that you consider trivial but that happen to be really quite essential
i think you’ve had enough to drink
the examining magistrate was much too grateful to them and did not wish to complicate matters with such trifles, especially since the whole thing seemed to be just an ordinary argument between people who were drunk
she pointed to kalganov, who had had quite a bit to drink and had dozed off sitting on the sofa
that’s a good idea, alyosha said
as to the amount of money mitya had on him, kalganov refused to make an estimate: i don’t know how much there was
all right, that will do, take it!
like a wild beast, i took one step in his direction, stopped, and glared challengingly into his face
i cried out, striking my head with my hand
i suddenly realized that he had known who i was all along and so probably knew many other things as well
as you can see, i’m all mixed up: i’m here secretly in order to protect a secret
if god spares me for now and i go on living, i’ll wait on you too, for we should all wait on each other
and anyway, what do you see in him that you should make all this fuss over him?
too late for what?
may i join you, please, as one passing traveler joins other travelers?
i rather suspected something of the sort, though
and that's when the second branch of the sokolskys came to the fore
so you are trying to make me your spy, your paid spy!
what was i to do?
they got frightened then and stopped
would you give us a figure?
nevertheless, i am very well aware that there are women who can, within one second, sweep you off your feet by their beauty or charm, while with others it may take you as long as six months just to make them out and understand what's in them; to decipher a woman like that and fall in love with her, it's not enough just to look at her and be ready for whatever may come; no, a man must have a special gift for that
upon leaving the doctor, however, ivan wisely ignored his advice and did not put himself in the doctor’s hands
but mrs prutkov happened to be around, and it was through her that a job was found for me, for old sokolsky had been looking for a young man to work with him in his study
right now i will go and spend the night in some inn because i do not want to spend another night under this roof
but they would leave with nothing except the presents i might give them, and this would only double their curiosity about me:
but step in while i am getting ready  i wo not be a minute!
that’s a smoky topaz, nelyudov said with a smile
yes, you must absolutely go and see him right now
yes, it was indeed, yesterday's woman!
the good old hell fire was much better
well, with all the witnesses, it didn’t take the judge very long to decide
the ladies protested in whispers
i know how she feels about you!
could he mean what he was saying or, at least, did he really believe in the possibility of marrying me off?
the picture drawn by rakitin was grim and tragic and it seemed to further strengthen the position of the prosecution
or do you know what?
the pretty boy, however, did not seem in the least put off by her disgusted expression while she tried to wave him aside as if she were really afraid to be dirtied by touching him (it struck me as absurd because he was so neat and pretty and turned out to have an awfully elegant suit on when he threw off his topcoat)
i asked this suddenly, like one whose reason has lost control over his actions
you see, mr ivan, it’s like this
don’t be squeamish, use the proper words
an extremely profound observation, colonel
it was very elegant but old (that is, anna had worn it two or three times) and they were now trying to alter it
kolya called perezvon and the dog jumped down from the bed
then, when i had a new jacket made here in petersburg, i took it out of the old one and sewed it into the new jacket
that was all he said
i am too lazy and i find it unpleasant
as to his own child, he was only happy during the time his wife was pregnant, for when his son was born, gregory was filled with grief and despair: the boy had six fingers
to start with, who do you think you are referring to as  haversilov' in front of your mother?
when i entered the house, i was usually silent and unsmiling, i avoided looking at anyone and sometimes would not even say hello
for if i ran away, it would be my ordeal that i’d be escaping!
but then there is much love in men, almost christ-like love, i know that myself, ivan
ah, when i think how close i was to death as i stood there within his reach, putting it around his outstretched neck!
and so does mother
that’s what he wrote me himself
i will take off ten rubles
i hate his adam’s apple, his nose, his eyes, his shameless sneer
they taught him nothing
on the day the boy was to be christened, gregory was struck by an idea
my suggestion that you come was just as preposterous as my letter
that, i think, is true and you can write it down
two monks from the hermitage were already waiting, the father librarian and father paisii, a sickly man who, although he was not very advanced in years, had a reputation as a great scholar
i saw them peep out of the window surreptitiously two or three times, after which they pulled down the curtains
indeed, whenever she happened to talk about her little baby to someone or other, she did so in a whisper, even though gregory was out of earshot
he was to remember for the rest of his life that his restlessness that night became so overwhelmingly painful that it impelled him to act against his own better judgment
why are you so late in coming, alyosha?
but, instead, i am immensely strong
even then, he was definitely not in full possession of his mental faculties, for he admitted to me that he had hallucinations while walking about, that he met various persons who were dead in the street, and that satan came to visit him every evening
whip them up, andrei
and it would have been less humiliating for you
but it is not the sum of money itself that matters here—it is the fact that this sum was being used with disgusting cynicism to shatter his dream!
the children were discussing something very animatedly, as though they were taking counsel together
his reason for staying was to perform the autopsy on the victim, which had been arranged for the following morning
he wouldn’t accept presents from me
a strange and crazy notion!
that’s the way it feels to me
the man looked worried and concerned, and mitya thought he was looking for him
finally mrs khokhlakov decided to see him
there were a few merchants, some jews eying gold items, and a few members of the well-dressed class
pretty badly, for he was quite exasperated at the time
i have not yet deserved that much trust on her part
i mean, i must entrust you with a little secret: you remember that girl called olympia whom you met here?
and this went on until he broke completely under the strain of work, until he was beyond repair and died in a hospital
you are offending me, semyon
it simply struck me that it would make such an effective scene, my telling him that
a bunch of frauds!
i tried to teach her to walk by standing her up in a corner, taking two or three steps away, and then calling her
isn’t it a fact, though, that there is a certain vague feeling among the people of your town, a certain dissatisfaction with the results of the investigation, some sort of expectation of further developments and discoveries?
my mother is waiting for me for lunch, he said very quickly
as soon as she had returned from abroad, katerina had searched for the letter all over petersburg, including at andronikov's, and was still searching for it, in the vague hope that it might not be in versilov's hands; she had even gone to moscow to look for the letter and begged maria to check whether it was not among the papers she had in her house
i thought i’d look at her scornfully as she stood there in front of me and say in that special tone that shop-assistants use when they’re being insolent: you mean you’d really expect me to give you four thousand rubles for that?
he doesn’t believe in the hymn
there's nothing reprehensible in that, nothing at all
they roared with laughter at that, every single one of them
tell me, she stopped me as i was reaching the door, did you see with your own eyes that letter being torn up?
what an awful bore that old man is, mr miusov said as maximov trotted off, back toward the monastery
go, i said to him, tell people what you did
by that time, kolya was already far away, walking jauntily along with an air of triumph
and when mankind’s faith is shaken, the monks will hold up the image before the wavering world
but mother, how could mother go on living with him the way things were?
more and more often she glanced into ilyusha’s corner and seemed to be thinking hard about something
the sun lavished its light and warmth on them, watching lovingly over its beautiful children
i will come to that later, but i want to note here that it was this peculiarity in his attitude toward versilov that predisposed me in his favor
why did they have to bring the old prince to this miserable tenement house where he might be even more depressed by the surrounding shabbiness and poverty?
now there was a letter, a handwritten document, irrefutable evidence of the perfidy of her fiance's daughter and the conspiracy of all those who were trying to keep them apart
it's just as you said yourself—he's a very proud man and many such proud men, especially those who despise people, like to believe in god
i am going to clear it up
i, on the other hand, had something against you after i found out how badly you wanted your father’s death
and you must be firm and stick to what you have decided is right; do not give up out of weakness; be steady in your effort and do not throw yourself first this way and then that way
and how soon could i get another buyer, for i need the money badly, right away!
i could not possibly explain it
for if he sees light in the windows, he’ll want to come in
besides, ivan knew how fond alyosha was of their older brother
and anna thinks so too
stalking tirelessly a boar
didn’t i tell you not to come here again!
he wore a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat with a silver watch sticking out of the pocket
then i went to the corner, took the money from behind the icons, and threw the empty packet on the floor and the pink ribbon next to it
i got up from my chair too
i sprawled myself out on the sofa because that was my style at the time, the manner i affected
you did downstairs and you pointed your finger at me in front of your mother
i was bored and thought of picking up a book, but i did not: the idea that it would be looking for a way to kill time made me feel twice as uncomfortable
ah, how i love this boy!
just look at him: in the middle of the night with a loose woman, covered with his father’s blood
and they carry gretchen off, and just at that moment the curtain must fall
it was a real privilege to make her acquaintance
that day, i swept aside everything that could hold me back, and i want you to know that i would decided to break off definitely with your mother and told her so
he goes to the public baths
he used them to buy chocolate and cakes in the pastry shop next door for himself and the other boys without even bothering to offer me any
but mitya was troubled, deeply troubled, and many claws lacerated his heart
now, as for me, i’m prepared to give in to you not only on that most important point but on every point and in everything, and i swear right now that that’s the way it will be as long as i live!
nashchokin waited until darzan had finished and then said to sergei, she does not go out much these days
his eunuch-like face seemed to have shrunk, the hair at his temples, brushed back so carefully before, was now tousled, and the wave that had formerly been plastered down on his forehead was now reduced to a thin tuft of hair sticking up on the top of his head
and tomorrow i’ll beg those hands of the living god’ to let me go
besides, grushenka—i’m sorry, i mean miss svetlov—may have told you about it
it’s not the coat
i hope the reader will understand this
no, i went on serving her
and, then, where were they going to take all those pieces?
there was, therefore, no way that grushenka could have come in or got out
timofei told me today that there were lots of people there, sir
and what if
old zosima is certainly the most honest among the monks, he said, after listening to alyosha’s request in thoughtful silence
she suddenly cried, rushing toward him
but what would i prove by that?
you, too, trifon, forgive me!
then he managed to get a rough idea of the connections between the persons involved (the old prince, her, bjoring, anna, and versilov)
in fact, i had full intentions of doing so when i suddenly remembered that i would let him go until the next day
that's quite a thought, versilov said, and he was not laughing at all
once she and i were sitting on our terrace under the old lime trees, reading that novel, and the sun was setting too
mrs khokhlakov cut him short with a modesty worthy of her generosity
mother would ask him sometimes
what is it all about finally?
not for a moment!
and as they again pass house after house, the condemned man keeps thinking that there are still very, very many houses ahead
so why shouldn’t i call it a swindle?
and you, afanasy, i have prayed for you every day ever since that time
thank you, my dear boy
your money or your life’
you are mistaken about your own feelings, he concluded, but once you understand where you went wrong, everything can be corrected
he owned a couple of good dueling pistols and their cartridges, which he had not yet pawned because he happened to prize them above all his other belongings
i have mentioned this to you before
well, i for one know nothing about it yet
mitya asked him dreamily, pointing at one of the large rings on nelyudov’s right hand
since the three thousand rubles has been mentioned now, i will allow myself to anticipate a little at this point
you know, i surprised anna a great deal today when i told her the latest bit of gossip about the possibility of katerina akhmakov marrying baron bjoring
i met him on the boulevard, and this former university student (as he turned out to be) taught me a new peculiar game
but why,  the prosecution cries, didn’t smerdyakov confess his guilt in his suicide note?
one day the girl came to her father and declared that she wanted to marry versilov
you’ll get yourself into a real mess over there
i am so glad you took this street because otherwise i would not have found you today!
either because the little white rose fascinated her or because she wanted the flower as a keepsake, since it had been in her boy’s hands, she became very excited and stretched out her hands toward the flower
and what do you say about the trial?
but he was so carried away by his false misery that for a second he almost believed himself and was so moved that he actually did shed a few sentimental tears
you kept looking at me all the time
but then, in the silence of the night, she suddenly heard distant groans coming from the direction of the garden
in that basket was a hedgehog
you see, then, you yourself sowed the seeds of destruction for your own kingdom, and no one else is to blame
well, i’ve talked enough, he said, his smile more twisted than ever
i came here intending to forgive him if he would just offer me his hand; i was prepared to ask his forgiveness and to forgive him
but lisa—are not you at least sorry about her?
god lies not in strength but in truth
of course, he may have implanted a small worm of doubt in the jury and the public as to the value of the testimony of a man who was in a state in which he could have seen even the gates of heaven wide open, and who, moreover, still did not know what year it was
come, come, my dear boy, you are rather overdoing it, are not you?
nonsense, i bet you are imagining things
and suddenly a thought flashed through my head and i almost shouted:
i also want to emphasize the fact that the gun belonged to lambert while versilov himself came unarmed
i see—this is something you didn’t know then
why, is prince sergei a friend of yours then?
i’ll have to stay here for some time, though, with my two brothers
you see, i can even speak polish!
is it that if i leave, that’s what will happen here?
you were so sweet, i’d like to give you a big hug for it now!
i owe them nothing
but i must point out one thing: if god does exist and if he really created the world, then, as we well know
and when i woke up, my eyes were actually wet with tears
oh, he had not thought of anything else throughout the past few days!
will you believe me if i tell you that, after i left you this morning, after that scene there, i was thinking to myself that, after all, i’m just a callow twenty-three-year-old, and you, you saw it right away and it’s from that that you start
then he lived for a long time somewhere in southern russia
it’s because i’m too eager to live
don’t worry—i didn’t steal it from him
i got up too and together we pushed him out of the room
but what would alyosha do without him?
yes, he thought, what she said may be the real truth
i repeat again: i yield to no one the right to defend the accused, for i am both accuser and defender!
he raved even as he walked through the streets
she even seemed to enjoy providing him with all the minute details, but not because she savored his pain
he had risen when he saw his brother and his voice sounded warm and friendly; indeed, its warmth rather surprised alyosha
was it lambert who told you that?
because i am good, am i not, very, very good?
why, i certainly haven’t borne it all so that my crimes and my sufferings would be used as manure to nurture the harmony that will appear in some remote future to be enjoyed by some unknown creatures
i was all my mother had left then, but soon some good friends persuaded her that, since i was now her only son and she was not really poor, she ought to follow the example of so many other parents and send me to petersburg, so as not to deprive me of a brilliant career
she got up and the next thing i knew she was gone, she would vanished behind the heavy curtain
what can there have been between them to make him write her such letters?
for some reason they all expect that i will suddenly up and marry
he had been struck by katerina’s domineering ways and by her casual, easy, self-assured manner
i knew that there were things that were bothering him, but what is awful is that i imagined only about a tenth of what was really weighing on him and never even suspected the existence of the remaining nine-tenths
and, believe me, it didn’t take us long to manage it
to make things worse, the landlord once again started holding forth about spiritualism and described some unexplainable trick that he would witnessed himself at a seance when a touring medium had chopped off people's heads so that the blood gushed out in front of the audience; then the medium had pressed the heads back onto the necks until they became grafted again and everyone present had seen that too
samsonov had sent for this giant not because he was really afraid of dmitry—he was not one to be easily frightened—but because he thought it would be better to have a witness and, well, just in case
it had lambert's address on it, written very neatly and legibly
get him, get him, help!
alphonsine urged us shrilly
oh, by that time i had become quite permeated by hatred, unmitigated hatred for everybody and everything, and although i still followed touchard, clothesbrush in hand, now i hated him, hated him more and more with every passing day
he recovered from the terrible blow which, according to his deposition, you inflicted on him, a fact that has now been confirmed by your own statement
ah, do not worry, i am sure it's all nonsense
he came at once and waited in silence for, like all the rest of them, he lived in awe of his father
if i were in her place, i would not oppose it either, out of sheer pride!
so why should not she want to marry you?
the candles had been snuffed out a while before
it’s all lies, lies on top of more lies
we are going to take him home and tame him, she said
i invited you and you accepted my invitation
so give me your sweet little hand, miss katerina, my angel, grushenka said in a tender voice, in a tone of great reverence, taking katerina’s hand in hers, and i will kiss it just as you kissed mine, dear miss
where else would he be, if not with the lord?
so what happened then?
but i still had not recovered from the shock so i just took the money and walked toward the door
grushenka cried, imperiously stamping her foot on the floor
in short, i told him that he was the only person in petersburg i could ask to act as my second in an urgent matter of honor and that, having known each other since school, he could not refuse to carry my challenge to a duel to lieutenant of the guards prince sergei sokol-sky, who, just over a year ago in ems, had slapped my father, ver-silov
and her salvation will come from the common people, from their faith and their humility
he left behind a manuscript full of intricate theories, in which he uses phrenology, craniology, and even mathematics to prove that the russians are a second-rate people and therefore, being a russian himself, he does not consider it worthwhile remaining alive
i have told you everything, arkady, she went straight to the point; so you understand that whatever happens to me now depends entirely on you
c'est un ange, un ange du del!
ivan went to see mitya twice—the first time just after he arrived from moscow
i could send anyone, but i wanted an angel as my messenger
it is, you understand, a matter of conscience, of the deepest moral concern, and that makes the secret too important for me to cope with alone, so i put off deciding until i’d talked it over with you
except for one thing, it’s true: the day after her visit, her maid appeared stealthily and, without explanation, handed me an envelope addressed to me
by the way, everybody in town knew that, within two or three days of his arrival in town, the famous moscow doctor had indulged in some extremely disparaging remarks about dr herzenstube’s professional competence
last summer, in july, many of us pilgrims, we were hurrying to the monastery of our lady for the holy day
i’ve noticed it all along
mitya gazed blankly toward the window
at first i thought he was embarrassed for that long-legged friend of his
i can’t act as i ought to toward her and tell her now that we’re through, ivan said irritably
so this is my poem!
but it's too complex a subject for a superficial conversation like ours
and he’s still here
but i did not, feeling it was not dignified with this woman
i noticed you a long time ago, alyosha, and mitya knows about it; i told him
he begged father paisii to forgive his presumption
despite that, i grew very fond of him and confided all my thoughts and feelings to him, for even without knowing his secret i knew that he was a righteous man
you know he is not happy, do not you?
and these sensations would be dear to him and he would treasure them without realizing it himself, indeed, without knowing why or what he would ever do with them
as far as i am concerned, i wish all the best to that good and talented young man
but perhaps i was wrong and, of course, i did not express any opinion
by keeping the reader in ignorance, i clumsily fell for the novelistic device that i tried to ridicule at the outset
i’ve asked her to do an errand for me
he told me that anna thinks that too
a great saint, he was!
whether because of sickness or because of the eccentric streak in her character, lidia akhmakov did at times behave very unpredictably
but he had also detected in those eyes and in the line of her lips something that explained not only why dmitry had fallen madly in love with her but also what made it impossible for him to remain in love with her for long
thank you, grushenka, you’ve restored my faith in myself, mitya said in a quivering voice
that only shows how young you still are
why don’t you keep quiet, you idiot!
trifon plastunov was a solidly built man of medium height, with a rather fleshy face and an expression that was stern and forbidding, especially when he was dealing with the local villagers, but he had the gift of making himself most ingratiating when he felt there was some advantage to be derived from it
what do you mean, i’m lying?
i know i didn’t do it
all these reflections flooded my head
however, my poem is good
there were flowers from katerina too, and when alyosha went in, snegirev had a bunch of flowers in his shaking hands and was scattering them over his dear boy
who could blame me for looking around eagerly and trying to find at least one true friend?
besides, these hopes had been building up within him during the whole year of his life in the monastery and had become a habit with him
she had obviously guessed why i was praising him
oh, i felt so horribly insulted
he made no attempt at eloquence, at emotional modulations, at pathos, or at dramatic phrasemaking
i admit that i felt quite antagonistic toward sergei when i arrived, and i felt very ashamed of having allowed myself to burst into tears in his presence the day before
but it is not so
it’s that bad then, is it?
his eyes glowed then
the man’s long, light-brown beard was covered with hoar-frost
but let me tell you first, alexei, why i wanted to see you so badly
meanwhile i kept on renting the same small room, although i did not really live there
he would been to kraft's apartment in the morning
this was perhaps a unique case in fyodor karamazov’s life, for he was as sensual as a man can be, one who throughout his life was always prepared, at the slightest encouragement, to chase any skirt
i repeat, i have no intention of reporting the entire questioning of the witnesses, step by step
he tucked up his cassock and, as he leaped with the agility of a street urchin, his brother’s powerful paw caught him by the elbow and helped him over the fence
god knows, she said
the crowd waiting for him outside stirred hesitantly
the presiding judge opened the session by asking the bailiff whether all the jurors had reported
ah, lisa, do you really consider that you are absolutely blameless in all this, that you have nothing to reproach yourself for?
she was referring to the desperate step anna had decided to take, the boldest move she would made in her present desperate position
i left with the intention of settling in europe and never returning to russia
come and visit me there in the evening with krasotkin
i wanted to say something to him but could not, so i said nothing and just rushed out of the room
i said the young gentleman
it sounded like the explanations of a man coming home drunk and, with tremendous excitement, telling his wife or other members of his family that he has just this minute been insulted by some scoundrel while he himself has behaved very nobly, that he will teach the scoundrel a lesson yet—he goes on and on about it, rambling incoherently, banging on the table, shedding drunken tears
it’s frightening what you tell me, blessed and reverend father
well, i really don’t know
i suppose he has
said a fat, pockmarked local landowner, joining one of the groups discussing the trial
alyosha tried to protest that he didn’t want any liqueur
but at the same time he was gripped by terror: how could he make himself do it?
and once again he squandered the money there that he had stolen from his father after he killed him
i forgot to mention that he had a great love and respect for his name dolgoruky
this is beginning to sound like one of those conversations back at school, lambert
mitya followed her as though moving in a drunken haze
he's a german who does not usually go around wagging his tongue and, i remember very well, he's extremely honest
mr skotoboinikov, sir, take pity on these orphans, do not deprive them of their last crust of bread and do not drive them from their nest!
i want to destroy myself
no, not really differently, but i’m sorry i hated him the way i did
we have heard all that before, you will tell me; every german paterfamilias drums it into his children, which does not change the fact that there has still been only one rothschild (that is, the james rothschild of paris) while there have been millions of german papas
smerdyakov pulled back his right foot until it was level with the left one and drew himself up
i do not know myself
run and save old karamazov!
sit down, ivan, please, here on the sofa, alyosha said, frightened
yes, of course, you gave me your word of honor
the way we play in warsaw, anyone can come and stake against the bank
he just says that
besides, he said, kraft seemed to have jotted down at random thoughts that came to his mind
and so mother went on trying to pull the bench out of the sun with him on it
and she was so nice, invited me to dinner, thought she’d disarm me with her chocolate
i remember everything, alyosha
i’ll give it to you and you’ll pay her back
he was completely exhausted and was determined to go to sleep right away
the police released the results of their investigation, saying only that one v, a family man of around fifty, had suddenly declared his passionate love to a highly respectable lady, who did not happen to reciprocate his feelings
doesn’t it strike you as peculiar, though, when you stop to think of it?
only one person wound up the winner
but how am i to describe the feeling of deep sadness that weighed me down then and that i still remember so well and, above all, the fervid excitement which reached such a delirious pitch that i was kept awake at night tormented by my impatience to solve the riddles i had set myself?
i did not have to decide right away
i’m frightened myself, ma’am
where did he get that pater seraphicus from?
she was still crying
besides them, a young man of about twenty-two wearing ordinary clothes stood waiting in a corner (where he remained standing all the time)
the prosecutor and the defense counsel questioned katerina, mostly in an attempt to find out why she had concealed such an important piece of evidence until then and why her attitude toward the accused had been so different during her previous testimony
they work for one another and each of them gives up all he has, and this giving is happiness in itself
why are you gaping at me like that?
why, officially we are not even brother and sister but nameless bastards assumed to be the children of a serf, and who has ever heard of princes marrying even the legitimate offspring of serfs?
and that was happening right now
on the previous evening, i would received by mail quite a puzzling note from him
well, that child is here, in the next room, and i have been wanting to show it to you for a long time
grushenka was the first to see him
katerina, who would arrived just after them, was sitting on the sofa and lambert was standing in front of her and shouting as only a fool would
perkhotin had just finished a glass of tea, had put on his coat, and was about to leave for the capital city inn for a game of billiards
he is guilty, they thought, but he will be acquitted out of humane considerations, under the impact of the new ideas and the new feelings about these matters, etc, etc
i’ll tell you the whole truth, because i want you to know what a horrible creature i am
how can you say that?
kolya said, looking very intensely at alyosha
and in that dream it was as though i myself had known all these feelings of mankind as i looked at the cliffs, the sea, and the slanting rays of the setting sun
do you really believe that the combined wisdom of the earth could produce anything comparable in strength and depth to those three questions that the wise and powerful spirit asked you that day in the desert?
ivan asked with a grin of hatred
what damned nonsense and wild lies!
if you had not asked me to sell you that album, i would have sold it for forty kopeks
by the way, what was the matter with them today?
quite unexpectedly he burst into soundless, happy laughter and kept laughing for a long time
the living room, the largest room in the house, was furnished with a sort of old-fashioned pretentiousness
but i won’t stop myself and i’ll do that dishonorable, disgraceful thing
one day i may tell you more about that meeting, but for the moment i feel i ought to warn you, vasin went on enigmatically, that he appeared to me to be in an abnormal state
he was not in the least troubled by the fact that zosima stood before him an isolated phenomenon: it makes no difference, he is a saint, and his heart knows the secret of regeneration for all, the power that will finally establish the rule of truth on earth
perhaps it vanished from there the next day and is now again in the possession of the accused
she said with a venomous smile, as if weighing what i would told her
that would be very pleasant
the boy had his overcoat pockets filled with stones ready to throw; one could see his pockets bulging with them thirty yards away
the old man enters the cell alone and, when he is inside, the door closes behind him
i did not know that
why, i’ll get my daughters up for you, sir, and won’t charge you anything for it, let alone a sum like the one you mentioned
without further thought, mitya went to this man and offered to pawn his pistols to him for ten rubles
but, of course, that ca not be exactly the way i felt then; i could not possibly have analyzed it like that; it's only now that i like to think of myself understanding him, now that i have the advantage of hindsight
papa, papa, come here, ilyusha muttered in great excitement, but he was too weak to go on
cried someone in a group of young civil servants
forgive me, madam, are you quite sure you never gave him any money?
seems to be angry at something
and now shall i tell you why you really came here?
before you speak of such historical events as the founding of a nation, you should first try to understand what it means, he said in a stern, lecturing tone
please wait a moment, the other said in a clear and delicate voice, slightly drawling his words
then something quite unexpected happened
i shall simply repeat here what i have said before: he chose the course he did only because it struck him at that particular moment as the ideal course for his soul, which longed to escape from darkness into light
as to the specific case, the tragedy itself and the individuals involved, from the accused on down—the presiding judge felt quite indifferent and detached about it all, as perhaps, indeed, he should have
it was very hot and i kept flinging open my heavy raccoon-lined coat
she’s really absolutely marvelous in her own way!
well, how are you, arkady, how do you feel now after what happened?
this man is just another von sohn
you see, i did not really know him, but
no, not on purpose!
right: she won’t, she won’t, she won’t!
you know how it is when the moon is up and the snow glistens
it was obvious that his neighbors had avoided seeing anyone, including the landlady, and during the past few days vasin had noticed that they were going through some sort of a crisis, although he had never witnessed such outbursts as i had
but then, you need to know how to find it and that takes talent!
yes, makar is dead, and mr versilov would like you to come over right away
because of his sickness, the elder had hardly left his cell at all of late and he had been unable to see even his regular visitors
and what reasons does he give?
and that way we will be rid of the landlord too
katerina called suddenly, looking toward the portiere that separated the drawing room from the room next door
she, for her part, knew what he had come to see her about now
she wants to make a wager with me that in a fortnight she’ll be dancing the quadrille
damn you—i have been wanting to send you packing for a long time, and now i am happy to do it at last!
do not repine, boy, mystery makes it even more beautiful, he added with tender fervor
you can take the bottle away, ivan
ah, they will value all too highly the advantages to be derived from submitting to us once and for all
so i remained all alone
tell me, though, where will the prince spend the night?
and that's how the young prince sergei sokolsky will pay me back what he owes me
but smerdyakov had no choice: he’d have killed me if i hadn’t told him
she hinted that she was willing to go along with all his suggestions, leading him to believe that she was promising him what he was asking for, but it was only an implied agreement: she listened to what he had to say but offered him nothing but an approving silence
i have taken the liberty of intruding upon you, madam, because of a matter that concerns a mutual acquaintance, mr dmitry karamazov, perkhotin began; but as soon as he mentioned that name, the lady’s face showed violent irritation and she interrupted him in a voice shrill with fury:
gradually ivan began to lose consciousness altogether
i succeeded in tiptoeing up to her so she did not hear me and then suddenly i threw my arms round her and kissed her
i retorted and turned around, presenting my back to him
mitya understands exactly how i feel
do you plead guilty or not guilty?
why do not you come home with me?
i was so afraid that, in my state of terror, i sort of suspected everybody
actually, she was neither my aunt nor anybody else's, but somehow everyone called her that all her life
was it an acknowledgment of her guilt toward me, as i once thought several years later?
she exclaimed at the end of her letter
in that letter i delivered to katerina yesterday, he asked her to meet him whatever her answer to his proposal
well, yes, i did fall in love with that educated young lady
no, just a minute, wait, he said, and went on to tell everything down to the last little grain of dust, acknowledging his guilt with tears of penitence streaming down his cheeks
all these people now interrupted their conversation and looked over at us
you must be joking, sir, the little pole said to kalganov sternly, looking him up and down
he glanced around the deserted summer house and today it struck him as older and more dilapidated than it had yesterday
i assure you, nothing will happen to you
and we shall indeed take their sins upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors, who will answer to god for the sins they, the weak, commit
he said i’m a lady without legs, but in fact i have huge legs, like barrels
despite the almost palpable inconsistencies in alphonsine's crazy tale, we accepted it because we had no time to analyze it and because somehow it struck us then as extremely plausible
and you know—i have my 'idea'
a man can blurt out anything
why, you are accepting money from him now
she cried, clasping her hands in front of her in her characteristic gesture of alarm
i’ve never hidden the way i felt about him—the whole town knows it; i’ve said it often enough in the tavern
anna came to my room, clasped her hands beseechingly before me, and implored me—not for her sake but for the prince's—not to move out of the apartment, to stay there, and to go and see the prince the moment he woke up because otherwise he would have a nervous fit and might not be able to preserve his sanity even until evening
he found himself in a wooden cabin, quite spacious hut terribly crowded with both people and all sorts of household junk
i like her so much, especially at certain moments
i went to three monasteries and they told me, go there too, nastya, go and pray there too,  meaning this monastery, that is
oh, so that’s why she keeps looking around with her lorgnette!
he did not deign to enlighten me
and what if i should meet somebody there?
it is true i suddenly had a father, a feeling i had never experienced before
but this is precisely what jealous men cannot see, although many of them happen to be men of admirable character
i’ll soon find out for myself whether he is or not, grushenka said, a threatening note creeping into her voice as she removed the handkerchief from her face
as a matter of fact, i think you’re right, i won’t send him to school anymore
i’ve seen and heard, alyosha mumbled
i know there's a thousand here anyway
you accused me just now of disbelief, of seeing and still not believing
and that is the gist of my article
and that’s the way i understood it
as we went in the tiny entry, i heard loud voices arguing about something, with one voice shouting:
ah, get out of here, you bunch of jesuits!
there was terrible confusion among us and, above all, an upsurge of superstition and gossip (for there is as much gossip in our nether world as there is in yours, in fact a bit more) and also denunciations, because we, too, have an institution where denunciations of one’s neighbors can be handed in
what amazing competence and clear thinking in such a young man, especially these days!
alyosha was very embarrassed
she remained silent for a moment and sighed
what great time, sir!
grushenka was the first to call for champagne:
you know what, papa, i will get rich, become an officer, and rout all enemies
if once again i, so to speak, threw myself into your arms, it was only because when i came in you told me the good news with such obvious pleasure and were, as you said, delighted that i got here in time, and all that after the remark i made to you about the word debut
why, stebelkov said, prince sergei is really in a very, very bad position, and not just because of me
nothing will happen to him
he greatly appreciates chivalry and generosity, but i believe that to him it's only a principle, an abstract ideal
oh, everything is so easy for people like that!
he pulled his chair up as close to the table as he could and made a quick sign of the cross under the table
they’re the kind you can kick in the backside and you’d still be doing them too great an honor
does this cover it?
the fact that i could have had such a dream, the fact that it could have gushed out of my mind formulated as it was, indicated that i was aware of lots of things—not that i actually knew about them, but that i had a presentiment of much of what was afoot that i have explained here
indeed, he appeared quite unable to fix his attention on any particular line of thought
but i had to have full assurance of your consent because that way i knew you’d never kick up a fuss about the missing three thousand if something went wrong and they suspected me, instead of mr dmitry, or even just thought i was his accomplice
it was to be discovered after his death that he had made many other donations secretly, shunning publicity
i’ll be her husband and i’ll be worthy of her
he had not even grasped the fundamental ideas underlying the agrarian reforms; he only found out about them gradually as he went along, a little each year, acquiring knowledge willy-nilly, just because he was faced by the hard facts of life—all of which was particularly surprising in view of the fact that he was a landowner himself
was i full of bitterness?
he knew it had not been there when he had sunk exhausted onto the trunk
if you can accept the responsibility for the crime committed by the man standing before you, whom you are judging in your heart, then take the crime upon yourself and pay for it with your suffering and let the accused walk away without reproach
i think it must have been good!
i thought she looked strikingly beautiful and that she was not in the least pale, as some ladies claimed later
i’ve suspected as much for a long time, you know
for half a minute neither of them spoke
as it is, you have done a great deal, for you have come to know yourself deeply and sincerely
all the members of the household came out to see him off—smerdyakov, martha, and gregory—and ivan gave them ten rubles each
most likely they will go bankrupt too
that’s exactly what he did, except for saying, the hell with all the rest
besides, when you think of it—how could i possibly be your judge?
what on earth, for instance, could have induced me to go to dergachev's and start spouting all those inanities when i should have known in advance that i could not possibly explain anything to them so that it would make sense and that the best thing i could do was to keep my mouth shut?
she took out the envelope that i recognized
but you did want someone else to do it—that, certainly, was something you wished
alas, i still assumed that i had the document in my possession!
your mother is just the opposite of the newspapers which proclaim that anything new makes news and is good, versilov said in a lighter and more cheerful tone, trying to joke away the unpleasantness
nevertheless, as he was going up the front steps of mrs khokhlakov’s house, an icy shiver of fear chilled his spine, for he realized in a flash that this was his last hope, that if he failed now, there would be nothing left for him, unless it is to cut someone’s throat and rob him, and all that for a miserable three thousand
those young ladies taught me french there, but what i liked best were krylov's fables
do you really think i relish all these squabbles between you two?
and kolya proceeded to make the dog do all the tricks he knew
he had not meant to tell me, but he did
i have something to tell you that i think will interest you
your great prophet had a vision and told us in an allegory that he had seen all those who were in the first resurrection and that there were twelve thousand of them from each tribe
something like that
i suppose you’ve had enough of listening to all this filth
kind of spitefully, though
for just at that time they had succeeded in getting her fiance under control and whisking him off to tsarskoe where they kept him under supervision while, for good measure, keeping an eye on her too
the conversation came to a halt for a moment, but as the elder resumed his seat, he looked around at the others, apparently inviting them to continue their discussion
he robbed him of fifteen hundred rubles and then went straight to have his hair curled and, without even bothering to hide the money, practically carrying it around in his hand, just like this one, went off to a brothel
well, she must’ve thought to herself: there’s nothing i can’t manage, nothing i can’t cope with, and if i try, i’ll put my spell on grushenka too, like anyone else
who is the man who can say of himself, i am holy’?
i have often noticed that even the most dissolute of frenchmen are excessively addicted to their bourgeois routine when it comes to their domestic life, to a sort of daily, dull ritual of life established once and for all
ivan cried, still looking at him in amazement
a writer may write for thirty years without ever knowing why he spent all those years writing
just the opposite, you acted like an angel, yes, like an angel, and if i have to repeat it a thousand times to convince you, i will
but god will save russia, for even if the uneducated man of the people is depraved and cannot abstain from his foul sins, he knows that his sins are cursed by god and that he is doing wrong when he sins
he looked impatient, annoyed as it were, as if something that was about to happen was being unduly delayed
i think this is getting rather involved
in my opinion at least, he was not even a mystic
shell tell you herself and that will make you feel really good
she brought it in here earlier and then forgot to pick it up
but why did he ask me that?
if i must descend so low, i felt, why not go down to rock bottom?
feed us first, then ask for virtue—that will be the motto on the banners of those who will oppose you, of those who will raze your temple and build in its place a new, terrifying tower of babel
but should you, gentlemen of the jury, allow your feelings and opinions to be swayed like this?
she went back to the bed and felt for him with her hands in the dark, until she was convinced that the bed was really empty
there was a considerable commotion
they say and prophesy that you will come again with your proud, strong chosen ones and that you will be triumphant
selfishness displaces the old unifying principle, and the whole system breaks up into a multitude of individuals, each with a full set of civil rights
heaven is within reach of every one of us, and now it is within my reach too; if i chose i could have it tomorrow, real heaven, for all my life
i was dressed properly, not at all the way one imagines a secondhand dealer or a jewish speculator
god is against me!
indeed, you are a saint, even if you admit those calculations of yours because you imagine you are guilty of something or other and want to punish yourself for it
without a concrete idea of what he is living for, man would refuse to live, would rather exterminate himself than remain on this earth, even if bread were scattered all around him
and since the document has no legal force and the court has already decided in his favor, even the lawyer of the opposition is of that opinion and said as much to me just now
he had never yet come up to my attic, but on this occasion i had not been there an hour before i heard him climbing up the steps
you will leave here absolutely unharmed
alyosha was walking toward cathedral square
at the time, though, he paid little attention to him; it was only later that he remembered it
mitya was silent and so was the usually talkative andrei, who seemed afraid to say a word and only kept urging on his rather thin but lively bays
instinctively i hoped to find there something that could free me from all this madness, a quiet harbor where i could drop an anchor that would hold me
mummy, why is that little boy looking at my hedgehog like that?
why, didn’t you know that?
why, that boy, see?
you’ll have to invent something more intelligent to tell me or i won’t listen to you
when karamazov stopped spouting his stream of malicious slander, the father superior bowed his head and once more said solemnly:
that was all he had to say
i glared at him as he watched me with a sly triumphant air
she was sitting in her armchair by the door
what i was trying to say was that i was worrying almost constantly about you during all that time
that indicates real hunger, the last degree of hardship!
so you see what it means to be able to find the unique trait in everybody!
when samsonov’s name came up, she snapped with arrogant defiance: that’s nobody’s business!
it’s no use trying to turn around in circles now!
he was lying, i swear!
as for me, although i visit her rather often, i cannot say that we talk much about intimate subjects; indeed, we never so much as mention any of the recent happenings
i am sincerely fond of you, arkady, and, besides, i feel very guilty toward you for my behavior during these past two months
he yelled with a strange delight, a delight that might have seemed spiteful had it not been so sincere and unaffected
for a second he waved before alyosha’s eyes the two hundred-ruble bills that, throughout their conversation, he had been holding by a corner between thumb and forefinger
i’ll never, never, never believe it, nastya lisped heatedly
he suddenly interrupted himself, growing gloomy again
rakitin shouted loudly, turning red
when he waved his arms, the heavy chains he wore under his cassock clanked
besides, this one is so damned rich, mitya’s reasoning went
it's in a university that i belong, as a professor
besides, for obvious reasons she felt it awkward to talk about makar with me
well, old man, how are you getting along?
and that's just what you did when you saw me—you began to laugh
forgive them, kraft said incongruously
and having learned that i was just plain dolgoruky, the questioner would look me up and down with a blank, stupidly apathetic stare, which proved that he had no idea why he had asked me the question in the first place, and then walk away
her expression was amiable enough but with a furrow of reservation
with his suspiciousness and with the anger piled up inside him during the few days before, i was sure he’d use the signals to get inside the house
and hardly a second after he had been ushered into mrs khokhlakov’s drawing room, she herself came in, almost running, and told him openly that she had been expecting him
over him, tomorrow, they’ll sing the glorious anthem our helper and our defender
i remained sitting there for a long time, as it gradually became dark
i mean that bow before your brother dmitry
i had two rubles in cush
no, it was neither my illegitimacy which caused me to be taunted at touchard's school, nor my gloomy childhood, nor the desire for revenge, nor the need to record my protest that lay at the bottom of my idea—it came to me just because my character is what it is
her face was rather paler than usual, her lips and eyes were burning, and she nervously tapped the wooden arm-rest of the sofa with her foot
i see what you mean, karamazov, kolya said with feeling
it was right after the judiciary reforms that they found out about temporary insanity, and this is one of the beneficial results of our new judicial system
his expression was grim
i cried out enthusiastically
i know, i know, just the shadows of hooks
if you do, you’ll see for yourself that nothing will move, that everything will remain where it is, even though you shout all you want, and that should prove that you too, mr gregory, do not have the true faith, which you like to reproach others for lacking
alyosha looked at dmitry with great concentration
wait, alyosha, i must give you my parental blessing right now
the prosecutor asks us: at what moment could smerdyakov have committed the crime?
as i mentioned before, the most attractive thing about him was his complete lack of affectation, his total disregard for the impression he might make: one could guess he had an almost sinless heart
besides us, there were people eating at the four other tables, all of them respectable-looking gentlemen, army officers, and the like, since it was, after all, quite a fashionable restaurant
but i have no money
mitya jumped up and dashed out of the room to give the necessary instructions
ah, the damned rabble!
but how could you know that in advance?
as i said, i am convinced he wanted nothing, he was not even thinking: he just felt he had to be there, perhaps to leap out of hiding, say something to her, maybe insult her, and perhaps
after her father died, the pious people of the church became even more sentimental about her, since she was now officially an orphan
and, provided the writer had great talent, such a book would belong less to russian literature than to russian history
it’s enough to make anyone sick
what happened after that?
i have known the gentleman for three months, lisa added
i promise i wo not eat it!
the mother sat in a chair next to her daughter’s wheelchair and near her stood an old monk
he again spoke of mitya
ah, mais c’est bête enfin!
it so happened that, at that very moment, versilov was there, and it took him less than one second to devise the whole diabolical scheme
anna asked in surprise
why didn’t you stop me, ivan, why didn’t you tell me i was talking nonsense?
i wanted so badly to trample on them because they are so beautiful
the man kept looking in bewilderment from one woman to another
she asserted that they both could be true at once, that this was something called la haine dans i'amour, a mutual case of wounded love pride, etc, etc—some oversubtle romantic nonsense unworthy of any sane and responsible person, spiked, moreover, with a goodly amount of villainy
she called him papa or father, which was something i absolutely refused to do
in the miracle of god’s providence
versilov sank back into his chair and started talking again
so i guess they’re afraid of the environment
i had come now bearing all this in mind and only wanted to be sure that i would have a second when i needed him, for i did not know anyone else in petersburg
eventually they devised a new refinement
he was a steadfast, resolute man, who would stubbornly and unwaveringly follow a course once, for some reason (often extremely illogical), he had decided it was incontrovertibly right
when sergei came up with the idea, versilov listened to the offer without turning it down, but after that he never reminded sergei of it, indeed, never indicated that he had not forgotten all about it
the gang specialized mostly in family secrets
much later, lisa told me herself that around that time her liking for vasin diminished and that his calm detachment, which had impressed her so much at first, now struck her as rather unpleasant
please continue,  and i signed it, a mother
but then it's precisely for such lucky breaks that i am on the lookout; that's why i have decided to live in the streets
and that’s just what your brother ivan is waiting for
on top of that, ivan is trying to take his brother mitya’s fiancée away from him, and he seems to be succeeding
you know, my boy, he said, it's impossible to love men such as they are
no, i don’t feel like telling you today
so let it be a good lesson to her!
ivan wanted to rush to the window but it was as if his legs and arms had suddenly been fettered
yes, perkhotin, my dear fellow, that’s all nonsense
money confers despotic power upon a man, but at the same time it is the greatest equalizer and that's where its main force lies: money eradicates all inequalities
you see, maria, what a long-legged fool you have picked!
i must mention, by the way, that although academically alyosha was always among the top students, he was never actually the first in his class
in the old days, when we were with the army, we had many guests coming to visit us
and, as was to be expected, the playful report ended with an indignant moral indictment both of parricide in general and of the institution of serfdom, which had recently been abolished
i walk out of the room, wallowing in tremendous pride
to you, my sweet son, because you love me
the judge also warned him never to play such tricks again
indeed, he made me repeat twice about stebelkov questioning me about the gathering at dergachev's
they plan to prove that dmitry is insane and that he didn’t know what he was doing when he killed, alyosha said with a pale smile, but mitya won’t accept that
versilov had a son and a daughter by her
she looked at me intently
the prosecutor reached the finale of his peroration here
enough of this, please
her eyes flashed and she suddenly raised her voice
true happiness radiates from his face
her body was strong and full and, when she moved, her movements were so light that they seemed inaudible
do you think that’s likely, mr ivan?
i remember how zverev had devised a bed for me, also on the sofa
the roll hit him on the waistcoat and fell to the floor
excuse me for saying so, but it's awfully difficult to follow you
dmitry had no doubts about the business side of the deal he was going to offer samsonov; he was only worried about how samsonov would regard the deal from a non-commercial point of view
well, i ordered his pheasant for him, but he will pay for it—i will see to that!
lambert stupidly did not introduce us although we were to dine at the same table, so the pockmarked one could easily have taken me for one of lambert's assistant blackmailers
let the irresponsible fool sow his wild oats once more, for the last time
i was in a terrible hurry and had difficulty in controlling my breathing
his face was beaming
later, when grushenka started visiting mitya in prison (which she did as soon as she could go out, even before she had completely recovered), she would sit down upon her return with maximushka and talk all kinds of nonsense to him, just to try and take her mind off her grief; and she became quite accustomed to him
ivan said through his teeth
i remember everything, up to the very last second
at the trial, his lawyer had just about succeeded in having the case dismissed for lack of evidence when the accused suddenly interrupted him
i stared at her in astonishment and disgust
when i asked him what position i should take on religious matters, he would answer in the, silliest way, as one would answer a small child:
only that he was concerned about me, worried about the practical aspects of my future
after that, young smerdyakov crept into his corner and sat glowering from it for a whole week
no, you’re the one who contracted for that job, and you bungled it
before ivan had gone half way to smerdyakov’s house, the dry, nipping wind that had been blowing since morning became stronger and a fine, powdery snow started coming down heavily
i liked his remark
how stupid i was to have tormented myself for five years the way i have
my fondest wish is to be able to incarnate myself once and for all into some two-hundred-pound merchant’s wife and to believe seriously in all those things that she believes in
i arrived home in a highly excited and—i do not know why—exuberantly gay, albeit very confused, state
and, by that time, i am ashamed to admit, we had nothing at all to buy food with
good evening, i see you are all here, even including you, he said, turning to me
that unpleasantness struck me the very first second i saw him and the impression always remained with me
yes, dear boy, and it's my legs that give me most trouble
even in town, people talked of his death for a long time
i worry more that i might steal from them!
no, i don’t grasp it, alyosha said, looking at mitya with great curiosity
in the passage he took off his soft, wide-brimmed felt hat, the kind he always wore, and a shock of thick hair streaked with silver sprang up
you did bring her here!
well, forgive me if i’ve done the wrong thing
i wish to god he were dead!
ivan, i bet he picked it up from the jesuits somehow
oh, it was money he needed now more than anything else!
now, consider this: a man sits there, and he’s not mad at all, but then suddenly he has this temporary insanity
the first witness to be interrogated was the innkeeper, trifon plastunov
i won’t offer you any brandy since you’re fasting, although perhaps
that was the situation when i arrived
if so, it is
in fact, the other day, i had to borrow five hundred rubles from mr miusov myself
after that, he will find peace himself, and thank god, for it's high time he did
but in this case it’s not just the legs
it’s quite warm
get out of my sight!
so where is she?
he said, pointing to a tiny room that gave onto the passage where there was only an unpainted wooden table, a wicker chair, and a sofa covered with a checkered oilcloth just like the one in my attic here
so you could marry her right away
so mitya spent almost a year in gregory’s little house in the servants’ quarters
besides, i must confess that i myself belong to this reprehensible category of people and have suffered from that foible all my life
furthermore, i would like to study the question of whether my client killed his father without robbing him
but let's drop the subject for now, we will discuss it some other time
she’ll be praying for light from above, to know whether she should save her dear mitya or spell his doom
you see, it will probably be at the third stop in the convoy of convicts to siberia
i wo not try to describe the hubbub that followed
but if i see that this move, as ordinary and minor as it is, takes me further from my main goal, i will break off with them, leave everything, and withdraw into my shell
the girl, who was by then in love with versilov, accepted enthusiastically as she wanted to see in this gesture something more than mere chivalry, although she admired that too
the boy spent whole evenings there throughout the winter, until the exile was summoned back to petersburg, to take an appointment for which he had petitioned and, since he had some protectors, had now received
go on, let me hear it, all of it, don’t spare me: was she mad, did she have a fit?
and now i must confess to something pretty stupid
those spiritual needs he may have had evaporated completely, while his appetite for life expanded
on your way, smerdyakov!
but i wasn’t complaining at all
why, you told me yourself that night when you almost froze to death that she was in love with you
i knew that, my boy
neither mitya nor anyone else knew then that they were being watched
that makes sense, the prosecutor said, giving the examining magistrate a significant look; that’s usually the case
he stared at me
they beat her, kicked her, flogged her, for no reason that they themselves knew of
do you remember, on the day when dmitry broke into the house and beat up father, i said that i reserved to myself the right to wish
unfortunately i did not know at the time that versilov, the doctor, and tatyana had agreed, three days before, to do their best to distract mother as much as possible from her constant worrying and brooding about makar, who was in a much worse state than i suspected, quite hopeless in fact
what gates of heaven?
and, you know, i don’t think i’ll tell them about your ability to sham epileptic fits
you know what, ivan, everything must have been arranged this way by god himself
well, don’t think too badly of me, rakitin, my boy, for who can tell, i may be going to my death!
the doctor, very stupidly, decided to pretend to be offended and turned to makar, as though asking him to pronounce on tatyana's statement:
she apologized profusely about it, very movingly too, he-he!
he still did not know exactly what he was going to do, but he did know that he was no longer in full control of himself and that the least provocation could push him to the very limit, to some unspeakable abomination—although he knew he would not do anything for which he could be held legally punishable and that he would never commit a crime
and do you know sabaneyev?
i’ll only have some if alyosha does
in the garden, in that corner over there,  and now he’s whispering too
and you, my dear boy, i suppose you never even suspected anything all this time?
the brass pestle was in mitya’s hand and he tossed it away without even noticing what he was doing
the best part of it, though, is that you’ve come yourself
i’ve promised to save you and save you i shall
he yelled, furiously slapping the boy’s face
we could never do that
you are an incarnation of myself, i mean of one aspect of me only, the personification of my worst and most stupid thoughts and feelings
that’s what he said?
why, certainly, with the greatest pleasure; i’d consider it a special honor, i said to him, but as i spoke i felt almost frightened, because i was very impressed by this man
zverev expected kraft to arrive either that day or the following one and had sent me a note to that effect
and, you know, mother is like that too
if you praise me, you only make me ashamed of myself
but even so, i claim and proclaim, even so he would not have killed deliberately; he would have swung his brass pestle in loathing and disgust, without realizing that he might kill, without any intention of killing!
i may move out
i needed the money urgently
both of them are in his will as is
i ca not bear to hear you talk like that
you saw him, you saw him, didn’t you?
and i suddenly felt such infinite pity for him that i believe i would willingly have shared his predicament if only it could have made things a bit easier for him
but he did not get a chance: out!
and that was how i threw him out, alexei!
and it’s true—why did i go to chermashnya?
it is you who brought it on, she said
you did not know before what to tell me about my legal status in society, is that it?
it will be just the way you decide
i was the only one who could have told those arsonists that setting fire to the tuileries was wrong
then i hear him moving around and moaning
what proof do we have that the accused did not tell us the truth?
but he started it all!
come along, the more people, the better!
now kolbasnikov is furious with all of us, like an incensed donkey
soon it became quite evident, however, that grushenka required no sharp eye to watch over her behavior
he also took something of personal, sentimental value to him, but we will come to that later
i must make a note of it!
but when karamazov learned of this new development in smerdyakov, he at once decided that he was destined to be a cook and sent him off to moscow to be trained
men speak of hell fire as a physical fire
but we are also duty-bound in a case such as this to warn you of the harm you may do yourself by refusing to answer this or that particular question
i have seen the marks of this cruelty on the children working in factories
i let kraft get a little way ahead as i considered him of secondary interest
there was an impatient probing in the way she looked into my eyes
he replied from his end of the table, in a tone that was at once surprised and threatening
but what made him decide that you should go out into the world now?
imagine, just before all this happened, yesterday morning, she suddenly asked me: 'tell me, are you or are not you in love with katerina akhmakov?
the reason for this is that he has become accustomed to relying only on himself; he has split off from the whole and become an isolated unit; he has trained his soul not to rely on human help, not to believe in men and mankind, and only to worry that the wealth and privileges he has accumulated may get lost
three days before, i had found the clerk in the downstairs office and had asked him where i should inquire about my salary
so there’s no reason to be sorry for them
the boy looked at him in surprise
yes, that was certainly the most important, but since i could not mention it, everything he would confessed to me about his feelings, which i was sure would make mother happy, obviously remained beyond her understanding
when they announced that captain karamazov was there to see him, he at once declared he would not receive him
i thought i would wait and see whether i should go or not
have you come on lisa's behalf?
i mean, i wonder whether you
kolya felt he had to ward off this objection, although he was very pleased with it
in a third group:
they’ll have a funeral repast, i suppose, and the priest is coming back too
his name is perezvon
she was a very strange girl, vasin said, and it's quite possible that she was not always in her right mind
it was already daylight when i awoke
it’s all about true things
lisa said, pointing at me
ah, so you wo not give it to me
come on, man, speak up, for heaven's sake!
you know, father superior, you hurt his feelings by mentioning family harmony: he refuses to acknowledge the fact that we’re related
besides, my dear boy, what is there in man's world?
tell me, will vasin be there?
yes, and it’s true that the other nations won’t stand for it
stebelkov was on the point of following them but thought better of it, stopped short, raised one finger, and grinned, obviously having thought of something
he’s not looking for money or for security
i would just stayed for a minute and left without even sitting down
what sort of contempt could there be when we’re all just like him, for we are—we are not his betters
alyosha said with a shudder
here, these three sensualists are stalking one another now, each one of them with a knife hidden in the leg of his boot
now let us talk about that door a little, gentlemen of the jury
would you believe it, alyosha, sometimes i look at you and i’m ashamed of myself and of everything about me
i picked up the candle and saw him off to the landing
he had hardly stirred or taken his eyes off him
i was just about to get out of bed to install myself in the armchair by the table when daria came in
we shall allow them or forbid them to live with their wives or mistresses, to have or not have children—all according to the degree of their obedience to us—and they will submit to us with cheerfulness and joy
if you want my advice, lie down and demand that they send for a doctor at once
it was brief and to the point; it listed the main reasons why dmitry karamazov had been arrested and brought to trial, etc
these days it may be good to listen to what intelligent people say and try to remember it, anna said, perhaps in my defense
why not ascribe to me, instead of laziness und hypocrisy, something less reprehensible, a touch of stupidity perhaps, but high-minded stupidity?
rather, i’m trying to make use of you as a way of healing myself

and you have not been here either?
and what if it does not stick?

so you are not angry with me?
what the principle of this harmony is, the underground man cannot say; he has never found it

but he interested me greatly, and i spent that whole day under the influence of strange thoughts, so that i decided to call on him myself the next day, to return the visit

yes, if it were true; but i do not believe it, i have no right to and cannot believe it

one bright morning, around half-past ten, varvara ardalionovna ptitsyn, having gone out to visit some of her acquaintances, returned home in great and rueful pensiveness
she looked into her fiance's face and saw there an expression of compassion and bewilderment
m athos had gone to visit one of his friends, who happened to be out, m de tréville went on, a young béarnais, a cadet in his majesty's guards, m des essarts's company; but he had hardly settled himself in his friend's place and picked up a book while he waited, when a swarm of combined writ servers and soldiers came to lay siege to the house, broke down several doors  the cardinal made a sign to the king which meant: this was on that business i mentioned to you
why, you are all crying again!
mightn’t it be that you’re acting too light-mindedly, that you ought to look around first?
i feel quite distracted, you know
since boris left moscow for the army in , he had not seen the rostovs

i do not know how to answer your question, he said, blushing without knowing why himself
alexei ivanovich, alexei iva-novich, do not decide yet, sir!

now listen: give this letter to mikhail ilarionovich
you are a finicky one, said athos
but m de tréville knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen, the cardinal had had an extremely worried look, the king had been upset, and the reddened eyes of the queen had indicated that she had lain awake or wept

as for mme coquenard, she could not hold back her tears

they got to vereshchagin  a half-educated little merchant, you know, a piddler-diddler, the adjutant said, smiling
about how all this news affected me, i will tell later, in its place, but now—just a few concluding words about him
he sat deeply immersed in a folding armchair, constantly groaning and spreading the collar of his tunic, which, though unbuttoned, still seemed to chafe his neck
there's only one thing i ca not understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action
yes, i know, said the soldier

lambert drawled, laughing and triumphant
i will never go to your place, and know also that by tomorrow, or the day after without fail, this paper will be in her own hands, because this document belongs to her, because she wrote it, and i will hand it to her personally, and if you want to know where, know that i will do it through tatyana pavlovna, her acquaintance, in tatyana pavlovna's apartment—i will hand it to her in tatyana pavlovna's presence, and take nothing from her for it and now—off with you, forever, or else or else, lambert, i will deal with you less politely when i finished, i was trembling all over
he would had enough and left without further ado

yes, of an unbelievable flatness!
get out, get out, cursed woman!
as soon as vasin praised me, i suddenly felt an irrepressible urge to speak
as soon as i go home tonight, i’ll lie down at once … in two weeks i’ll be dead, i know that … last week b—–n told me himself … so, with your permission, i would like to say a couple of words to you in farewell
and when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, lazarus, come forth
he became still more irritable than before, and all the outbursts of his groundless wrath fell mainly upon princess marya
the terrible word trembled on his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out
and that's humiliating for a young man of any pride, in our day especially but remorse?

olympiada semyonovna shrugged at him and raised her eyes to heaven
well, you will see she worries me; but you will see, you will see!

those who left, taking along whatever they could, abandoning houses and half their property, acted that way because of the hidden (latent) patriotism which is expressed not in phrases, not in the killing of children to save the fatherland, and similar unnatural acts, but inconspicuously, simply, organically, and therefore always produces the strongest results

if you see so poorly, my dear sir, do not allow yourself to speak of what you do not know

last night i began reading a story describing an old man and his daughter
he had actually wept for three days, while the prince remained in petersburg, but during those three days he had also come to hate the prince for looking upon him much too compassionately, whereas the fact that he had returned so much money was something not everyone would bring himself to do
excuse me, monsieur, but i doubt he can receive you at this moment
moment the youth arrived with the carriage; on learning that the carriage was no longer needed, he became terribly frightened
so what is our position?
and so on and so forth
sonia cried in distress
only understand in what position you have placed her and myself in the eyes of the whole of society and even of the court, he added, lowering his voice

the door opened and razumihin came in
he thus resolved to defend the door bravely; and since, having been betrayed by the mistress of the inn, he could not say that aramis was not there, he tried to prove to the new arrival that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in the pious conference he had entered upon that morning, which, according to bazin, could not possibly end before evening

but the pain got its own back and overcame weariness and sleep; an hour later he awoke and with suffering got up from the sofa
i did not wish to change it in any way and tell it almost as simply as i heard it
and, followed by his lackey, he set out for the governor's country house
when pierre himself wanted to be unfaithful to his wish, she fought him with his own weapons

i ca not understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come?
but you know the reason why
if i am happy by an error, do not have the cruelty to take it from me
in those two months he had had time to think it over and decide, promising himself that he would try at all costs to cancel his father at least for a time, and even to efface him from petersburg, if possible, whether his mother agreed to it or not

pierre looked at her through his spectacles

here, of course, there's a special view his own disposition of ideas  undoubtedly, i interrupted warmly
the general heaved his shoulders

the council of war, at which prince andrei had not managed to speak out his opinion as he had hoped to, left in him a vague and disturbing impression
