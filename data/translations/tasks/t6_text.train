before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force, hurled this cluster of men backward into the place
the porter's lodge was closed
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, and bent down as though to examine something

it has its buttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses browse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one walks over this uncultivated land, and one's foot dives into mole-holes

let us inform ourselves of the trap

she did not wake
and then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys

you saved my life, said the man
waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century
every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes' cloak
the gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively
the two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the hand
the one who was in advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other

was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?
if your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff, he is lost
his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light
without doubt, this strange beacon light would awaken far away, the woodcutter of the hills of bicêtre, terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of notre-dame quivering over his heaths
then there would be an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, a confrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time, fauchelevent, coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone about his neck, the future

and she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating of her window, her hair dishevelled, her eyes flashing, with her shoulder striking against the wall, with the wild air of a female wolf in a cage, who has long been famished, and who feels the hour for her repast drawing near

then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it was alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw, which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula, and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet, its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings

thus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusion of consternation, all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the universe were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple and terrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due to legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy, the government, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legal infallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all this was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, javert, the spy of order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog providence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, at the summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he had come; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul

louis philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, by others, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present day, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor before history; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently and above all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: this one flattered the other

that done, she laid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep
the plateau of mont-saint-jean was captured, recaptured, captured again
she was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual

and without the mother even having seen her child once more, almost without the child's having known her mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if not for that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel, and which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children
the circling dances of the numberth of july effaced the enthusiasms of the numberth of march

no, replied the girl, but as his key is in the door, he must be out
the printed book, the gnawing worm of the edifice, sucks and devours it
the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never of love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame
like him, she had a mustache
this deliberation permitted enjolras to take a review of everything and to perfect everything
that he had thus two condemned creatures attached to him; that his companion asked no better than to take charge of the gypsy

said the archdeacon, a crucible for alchemy
invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night
a revolt was, in its eyes, no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths, and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril

fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined
he made up his mind to save m madeleine
at the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the holy see, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of notre-dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there, _altare pigrorum_
go to filspierre, between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil, and you will find work
and besides, the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochere, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it
he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger

enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman's face, had about him at that moment something of the antique themis
cosette had meant to scratch, and she lacerated
the wretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb; every movement that he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks; he feels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate
in the incomprehensible plan of these streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two clusters of great streets, like magnified sheaves of grain, one in the university, the other in the town, which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates
at moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, and undulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no one knows whence, and converting it into a snake
to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries, to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strike with lightning, to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory, to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of titans, to conquer the world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what greater thing is there?

cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled her caresses, as though she desired to pay marius' debt
it was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and equivocal being, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and the other like a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat of authority buttoned to the chin
great things had been accomplished, with it alongside
the hydra at the beginning, the angel at the end

at recreation hours, jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some unknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, that great anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word, and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute, in a lightning flash, the people and god

that which is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which sends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees not at all?
is it not the sower?
in this manner she reached the spring
she began to laugh
can one be more white and blonde?
there was no longer anything in the street; there was nothing in the garden
this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it
nevertheless, whatever may be the contrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, from the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it: disinterestedness
her candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed
the matter is simple
you must go there after you are married
was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future king charles vii
then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
in the tenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he succeeded no better
he did not stir
he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire
was the fire wholly extinct there?
this man has insinuated himself into your confidence, and almost into your family under a false name
he said to himself: there may still be a glimpse of life there, perchance; i will risk my own existence for that miserable spark!
the poor children, including gavroche, were famished
it was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put to himself: is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert?

the wretched woman began to laugh in her wild way
one must resign one's self

from the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works embraced everything
his hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers
an intercepted letter read: the day is not far distant when, within four hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
jean valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked slowly up to fantine's couch
these voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted
his face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks, produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale
could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid?
pontmercy fought at spire, at worms, at neustadt, at turkheim, at alzey, at mayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchard's rearguard
it is not hard to meet him
enjolras said: joly is ill, grantaire is drunk

he thought to himself
everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open

this had its disadvantages
she had not been there on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said: it appears that there is a row
the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity
the indefinite, which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
all of a sudden, he would burst out laughing
the first auditor whom messire miles d’isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the chef-saint-denis, was claude frollo

i do not want your angel, i want my child!
as he plunged into the side aisles, he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars

courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf
a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house

these flowers were his occupation
you see, my benefactor, no bread, no fire
the captain was the first to break the silence

when she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,
the corridor was long, the staircase steep, jondrette was talkative, m leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, marius, in that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this time it would be final

the man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and thenardier beheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more
the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, and the dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon
he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of l'homme arme became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes after his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois
by the way, my dear captain, you just mentioned the rue coupe-gueule that is a very bad form of speech; people are no longer so barbarous
he put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called gavroche
two or three times
cut-throat, yes; cutpurse, no
he had remained, therefore, for several minutes, leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney, and thinking or not thinking, when fleur-de-lys suddenly turned and addressed him

they began to wander aimlessly through the streets
my dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, and produce effects with your knees
is this your little girl?
what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation?
a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls
he made no reply
the thenardier inquired of the traveller

in truth, said gringoire to himself, she is a salamander, she is a nymph, she is a goddess, she is a bacchante of the menelean mount!
the song died away
at the shock of the beam, the half metallic door sounded like an immense drum; it was not burst in, but the whole cathedral trembled, and the deepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo
we shall not try to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose, that horseshoe mouth; that little left eye obstructed with a red, bushy, bristling eyebrow, while the right eye disappeared entirely beneath an enormous wart; of those teeth in disarray, broken here and there, like the embattled parapet of a fortress; of that callous lip, upon which one of these teeth encroached, like the tusk of an elephant; of that forked chin; and above all, of the expression spread over the whole; of that mixture of malice, amazement, and sadness

all these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of realities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable
the windows had short curtains, a sign that there was a woman about
the man was sitting there, and letting cosette get somewhat rested
nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passion augmented and grew to madness
monsieur pontmercy, you pardon me!
he had eaten nothing all day; it is probable that he was feverish
in the meantime aunt gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at bottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up marius' abode
the sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side, the priests of the officiality on the other
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
it is because it was six hundred years in building
it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors: people avoided him when he went out; he perceived the fact
i have been robbed, said the officer; i am sorry for that
and turning to marius:-my brother is here
this was his axiom: there is but one certainty, my full glass
got rid of is the word
was he seized at the age of forty-six with a supreme madness?
you are finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant
marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable light on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant
that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings, since it was in fauchelevent's pocket
it seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth,-- incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,-- as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once
when they were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of the bottles which enjolras had reserved, and of which we have spoken, and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs
they, on their side, did not appear even to see him
the king looked him full in the face
hesitations, scruples, particularly on the part of aunt gillenormand
at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post
but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered?
the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second
ou vont les belles filles, lon la
he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a smoking roof, of a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep
jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint

the lawyer left him
a fine pleasure to produce, when you walk, the same noise as the quay of old iron, in an earthquake!
all four were madly pretty
it seems to me at times that you are a dream
they passed the bakeshop, but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch
it was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
in the second place, are you the discharged convict, jean valjean-- yes or no?
the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky
on emerging upon the place, he laughed yet more heartily
paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air
the central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages, whose birds, reared by himself, sang for him alone

it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts, you shall give her your arm, you know, as you used to, in the luxembourg
they had stopped crying
who will plant the flag on the barricade again?
a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle

the soldiers fly from him, shouting, long live marshal ney!
the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms
who thus soils the triumph?
he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette, where they could both hide themselves
she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier:-may i, madame?
no idiom is more metaphorical than slang: devisser le coco (to unscrew the nut), to twist the neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat; etre gerbe, to be tried; a rat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains, a striking, ancient figure which partly bears its date about it, which assimilates long oblique lines of rain, with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers, and which compresses into a single word the popular expression: it rains halberds
and of the dean, m delvincourt: what a monument!
but how was it to be done?
the man resumed tranquilly, put me in the stable
the priest’s eye was staring, wild, flaming, and remained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly
their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness
when one heard her speak, one said, that is a gendarme; when one saw her drink, one said, that is a carter; when one saw her handle cosette, one said, that is the hangman

this carriage which has become colossal through its freight, has an air of conquest
to-day is ash-wednesday; but not for the birds
with the abrupt leap of that spider which we have seen fling itself upon a fly at the trembling of its web, she rushed to her air-hole, which opened as the reader knows, on the place de grève
something enormous remained long empty through napoleon's disappearance
jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it
the conventionary opened his eyes again
grumbled phoebus, here’s a villanous; ruffled bird which i fancy i have seen somewhere
hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse his indignation
the parisians stared indifferently at this useless thing
the thinker of to-day has a great duty-- to auscultate civilization
my lodger sends me into bankruptcy
shall you come again, doctor?
asked brujon, the rue p?
let's get well into a corner, said brujon
the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance
all at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike surmounted with a red liberty-cap
from the cess-pool, it re-constitutes the city; from mud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora or the jug

he had climbed over the garden wall at the rue polonceau corner, the hymn of angels that he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns singing matins; the room he had glimpsed in the dark was the chapel; the ghost he had seen stretched out on the ground was a sister making atonement; the little bell whose ringing had so strangely startled him was the gardener’s bell tied around father fauchelevent’s knee

year's day,   thoroughly convinced of the lethal character of the works of oskar kokoschka, emil nolde or the sculptor, lehmbruck, gimpel goes on to tell us that there never has been any such thing as old-master art or modern or contemporary art, but that the 'old master' shaped us, whereas the 'contemporary' artist shapes the perception of the next generation, to the point where no one is 'ahead of their titne for they are their time, each and every day'

she got her breath back for a moment, lifted the handle again and started walking once more, this time for a little longer
all of a sudden, he stopped in his tracks
what is the world coming to?
the flowers fell to the florists as of right
a trickle of light fell from the air vent through which he had slipped and his eyes adjusted to the vault

does it stop martin of toursnumber from being a saint and from having given half the coat off his back to a pauper?
at first, before he had time to think, lost as he was, like a drowning man clutching at straws he had tried to find the child to give him back his money; then, when he realized that this was pointless and impossible, he gave way to despair
how many times have we seen jean valjean seized in the dark in hand-to-hand combat by his conscience and fighting desperately against it!
fauchelevent’s wild eyes went automatically to this pocket and stayed there
at night, dripping with sweat, shattered by fatigue, the green cap over his eyes, to mount two by two, under the sergeant’s whip, the gangway of that floating prison!

jean valjean could see the way out
yet on the way back to the rue de babylone with cosette, jean valjean did not notice that she asked him other questions about what they had just seen; maybe he was too absorbed in his own utter dejection to register what she said and to respond

wherever there are fewer houses and fewer streets, the sewer has fewer air vents
the mass bristling with bayonets hurled themselves forward like gymnasts, irresistibly, and the dense battlefront of the attacking column appeared through the smoke at the top of the steep slope

he had not exactly voted for the death of the king, but as good as

he turns out to be ivan koslovsky, the russian tenor par excellence, a man who traversed the torments of the century imperturbably singing the muted melody of the indian merchant in sadko or lensky's farewell lines in eugene onegin:

there was someone there; but that someone was not among those the human eye can see
that great need of mankind’s, the finite, which allows itself to be embraced, is something they know nothing about
he remembered his giddy exhilaration, his intoxication with cosette, how love absorbed everything, how they’d kidnapped each other and carried each other off into the ideal, and perhaps, also, as the imperceptible dose of reason mixed in with that violent and wonderful state of the soul, a vague and nameless instinct to hide and to wipe from his memory that fearful episode he did not want to go near, in which he did not want to play any kind of rôle, which he himself shunned and in which he could be neither narrator nor witness without also being accuser
a subterranean edifice built together by all the miserable outcasts
sometimes he would allude to his ninety years and say: i do hope i won’t see ninety-three twice

great combatants must rise up, illuminate nations by their audacity, and shake up this sad humanity that is covered in darkness by divine right, caesar-style glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, and absolute majesty; a throng busy gazing idiotically at these dismal triumphs of the night in all their crepuscular splendour
she ran into her father from time to time and he would say hello
besides, all the windows of this silent abode had thick iron bars on them, even the dormer windows in the roof

brutus strikes him with a knife, and god strikes him with a cometnumber hey presto!
thénardier, i’ve told you what your name is
jean valjean was crushed by this sadness and shattered by this softness
the rear courtyard was wrapped around by fairly high walls with only a few gardens beyond them for a vista
we’re at it too, good as
the counsel for the prosecution took the floor: gentlemen of the jury, this very strange and unexpected incident that has disturbed this hearing inspires in us, as in you, only a feeling we have no need to express
to hoodwink the police?
ah, but you’re alive—that’s the best part about it!
he had something divine about him at that moment, a quality that forces the multitudes to draw back and make way before a man

paris has an aesop and it is mayeux, and a canidia and it is mademoiselle lenormand,number the fortune-teller
dying is nothing, what is unbearable is dying without seeing her
in that sweet month of may, marius and cosette discovered what triggered even more immense happiness:
that way they had twelve hours of darkness ahead of them and they worked out how to put them to use
the sun has sneezed hummingbirds

this cry, which was famous around number, was a strategic warning telegraphed from gamin to gamin; it scans like lines of homer, with a notation almost as inexpressible as the eleusinian lamentations of the panathenaea,number and it brings the antique evoe to mind
the two little abandoned boys had almost got as far as the big pond, but they were a bit overwhelmed by all this light, and they tried to hide—an instinct of the poor and weak in the face of magnificence, even when impersonal; they ducked behind the swans’ shelter and stayed there
to suddenly see blossoming in the middle of all her misery the fruits of paradise!

in conversation, he was affable and cheery
without going further into issues that only indirectly touch on the subject of this book, we will simply say this: it would have been a good thing if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his gaze had not been turned for a single moment from that serene contemplation where we see, shining clearly above the stormy hustle and bustle of human affairs, those three pure lights, truth, justice, and charity
; she had swept her two children into her arms and swiftly taken refuge behind her husband, gazing at the stranger in horror, her throat bare, her eyes wild with fright, murmuring almost inaudibly in french alpine patois: tso-maraude—chat de maraude, or cat of a thief
that’s where marius is going, then?
you’ll just have to wait
he took good care not to be useless; having books did not stop him from reading, being a botanist did not stop him from being a gardener
i voted for the demise of that particular tyrant

in critical moments, on the big days, people did not so much listen to leaders as to their own instincts
at the same time, a sort of young workman, thin, pale, small, freckled, dressed in a torn smock and patched-up corduroy trousers, who looked more like a girl playing a boy than a man, came out of the lodge and told courfeyrac in a voice that was certainly not in any way like a woman’s voice: monsieur marius, please?
to see is to devour
marius cast his eyes wildly around him; the last, automatic resort of despair

he stayed where he was, petrified like the proverbial pillar of salt, not daring to make a move
jean valjean himself suspected nothing
he had a pipe clamped in his mouth and was puffing on it
which of the two would drop first?
the counterrevolution was unintentionally liberal the same way that, through a corresponding phenomenon, napoléon was unintentionally revolutionary
it always causes your heart to lurch, seeing these clusters of men in black murmuring among themselves sotto voce on the threshold of courts of law
gloomy face-off of the egoists and the miserable
jean valjean made no changes to the furniture that was there the first day; only, he had replaced the glass door of cosette’s small side room with a solid door
the cold, the worry, the anxiety, the anguish of the night were giving him a real fever and all these ideas were crashing around in his brain
he slipped through a breach and was back inside the town

my dear bishop, the immortality of man is a fabulous fairy tale
grave and obscure questions, to the last of which any physiologist would probably have answered no, and without hestitating, if he had seen—in toulon, in hours of rest, which were for jean valjean hours of reverie, as he sat, arms crossed, on the bar of some capstan, the end of his chain stuffed in his pocket to stop it from dragging—this forlorn galley slave,number grave, silent, and pensive, a pariah of laws that look on man with anger, one of civilization’s damned, who looked so harshly on the heavens

he gathered the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her to the farthest corner of the shed, behind a pile of old furniture that was no longer in use
there were two wicker prie-dieu chairs in the oratory, and an armchair also made of wicker in the bedroom
this sort of thing will keep happening as long as they go off and read the newspapers under the arches of the odéon
the man had sat down there to let cosette have a little rest
and so this sorry soul went on debating with himself in anguish
fire lapped at his feet, which can now only be seen as blackened stumps, then it stopped

once, on the subject of education, which marius thought should be free and compulsory, spread far and wide in all its forms, lavished on all like the air and the sun, in a word, breathable by the whole population, they were in complete agreement and almost chatted

they wore plumeless helmets and cuirasses of beaten iron, with cavalry pistols in their holsters and long sabres
this always finishes, it is true, in an awakening, but a tardy one
men are so lucky!
prejudices are the real thieves, vices are the murderers
i had a strong notion, as soon as you were better, to plant her right here at your bedside, but it’s only in novels that one sticks young girls without further ado by the beds of the pretty wounded lads they’ve got their eye on
marius looked at this man

brujon was deft; gueulemer was strong
someone’s come through the sewer?
every day jean valjean took cosette’s arm and took her out for a stroll
naïveté has taken refuge there, basil’s mask is found down there, but you can see the pasteboard and strings and the inside as well as the outside, and it is enhanced by honest muck
but this particular camera changed purpose and the images it shot match up with other images, taken behind other windows, to converge on this central point where the images of official television show us the romanian leader, the conducator, haranguing his usual audience but being interrupted by the spectacle and dissonant noise coming from the far end of the square

a wart lives up her nose, so risky—true;

ushers, said the president, call the room to order

one afternoon—it was one of the first days of april, already hot, still fresh, that time of the year when the sun is so jaunty, the gardens around marius and cosette’s windows seemed visibly to be waking up, the hawthorn was about to break out, a jewelled array of wallflowers was spreading out over the old walls, pink snapdragons yawned in the cracks between the stones, lovely little daisies and buttercups were just starting to push up through the grass, white butterflies made their first appearance of the year, and the wind, that fiddler at life’s eternal wedding, tried out in the trees the first notes of that great dawn symphony the old poets used to call renewal—marius said to cosette: we said we’d go back and see our garden in the rue plumet

there had been many days of fasting
the tumultuous give-and-take of all these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl
only, he felt that, whatever side he opted for, necessarily and without his being able to escape it, something of himself would die; that he was entering a tomb, and whether he took the left turn or the right, he would undergo the final agony of death, the demise of his happiness or the demise of his virtue

father fauchelevent, apart from the glory we have just recounted and of which he was completely ignorant, was rewarded for his good deed; first, he was glad he’d done it, it made him happy; and then, he had a lot less work to do now he was sharing the load

these range from the surrealist images of happiness, whose burlesque lightness of touch seems mockingly to undermine the promises of the official version of happiness, despite the conformism of the script, to the militant images produced by the cine-train, rolling across russia to shoot from life and immediately relay to the interested parties the debates of people taking control of factories, land or housing; from official images made surrealist – or surrealist images made official?

the year number was, however, indicated by two objects that were in vogue at the time with the middle class and were sitting on a table, to wit, a kaleidoscope and an iridescent tin lamp
what it thereby accompanies on screen is a minute yet decisive change in the appearance of the faces and attitudes of the colonized, in the happiness’ they express: they respond to the surprise of these imposed exercises with attention, with a certain pride in playing the game, as perfectly as possible, before the blackboard at school or the iron at the forge

that terrible june number lives on; the artificial hill monument fades from view, the nondescript lion evaporates, the battlefield resumes its reality; lines of infantry snake across the plain, furious galloping stirs up the horizon; the startled dreamer sees the lightning flash of sabres, the glint of bayonets, the blazing of bursting shells, the monstrous crossfire of thunderbolts; he hears the dim clamour of the phantom battle, like a death rattle from the depths of the grave; these shades are the grenadiers; these gleams are cuirassiers; this skeleton is napoléon; that skeleton is wellington; all this is no more and yet the slaughter continues; and the ravines run red with blood and the trees shiver and the fury rises up to the skies, and in the darkness, all these wild and wind-blasted heights, mont-saint-jean, hougoumont, frischemont, papelotte, planchenoit, appear crowned by blurry whirlpools of spectres exterminating each other

but the wall of the covered way of la force followed a jagged and uneven line; it had ups and downs, it dipped down at the fire station, it rose up again at the bathhouse, it was intersected by buildings, it was not the same height at the hôtel lamoignon as on the rue pavée, it had sudden drops and right angles everywhere; and then, the sentries would have seen the fugitive’s black silhouette; on that score, the route taken by thénardier still remains virtually inexplicable

championnet,number who abused miracles, was a child of the streets of paris; when still very little, he flooded the porticoes of saint-jean-de-beauvais and saint-étienne-du-mont, and he was on such intimate terms with saint geneviève’s shrine as to order about saint januarius’s glass vial, causing the blood to suddenly liquefy at will

however, there was always a fog hanging over these leaders, and no actual fact could shore up the odd pride of this response made later by a defendant before the court of peers:number
isolation, detachment from everything, pride, independence, a love of nature, lack of any daily physical activity, living for himself, the secret struggles of chastity, benign rapture before all creation—all had prepared marius for this possession we call passion

never mind, the old geezer with the thing on his mitt, i’m sure i know him
as he was about to grab this bar, a hand shot out suddenly from the shadows and clapped itself on his arm
at that moment, the bludgeoning, multiplied by a hundred hands, was reaching a crescendo and extended to include whacking with the flats of swords; the galley slaves crouched down, bent double, under this storm of whips and clubs; a ghastly obeisance was produced by the torture and all fell silent, with the look of chained wolves

he was a mastiff watching a thief
when, in this mysterious travail, he had completely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin, when he had stripped off the aristocrat, the jacobin, and the royalist, when he was fully revolutionary, profoundly democratic, and almost republican, he went to an engraver on the quai des orfèvres and ordered from him a hundred calling cards bearing this name: baron marius pontmercynumber

monsieur gillenormand went on: cannons in the courtyard of the museum!

in it, ordinary life is represented – that is, supplanted – by its materials themselves, by the detritus that gives it its concrete texture
it begins with a kiss, said blachevelle
at home, except when he got up or went to bed, he never wore a dressing gown
what are you trying to say?
then he crossed the overcoat over in front: the coat’s too big, of course … never mind, he added
without limits, there is no value; without value, there is no esteem, no respect and especially no pi ty: death to the referee!
marius’s arms were hanging around his neck and his feet dangling behind him
now, no blade is simple
this man was ready-made
the father asked: which cheek did he slap?
give me your orders, most reverend mother
where have all the beautiful girls gone,
you boo the victim to encourage him
when a being that is dear to us is about to die, you look at them with a look that clings to them in an effort to hold them back
the troops broke down the doors of houses from which there had been firing
and at a sign from courfeyrac, the mob rushed into the rue de la chanvrerie
the fiend dimly takes shape; it is every man for himself
the hour had sounded in the nick of time
second, yes or no, are you the freed convict jean valjean?
my name is euphrasie
it was the first time since they were married that she had dared criticize an act of the master
the snow was falling twice as heavily and filled the air
in just a few minutes, the mob with its thousand hands had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty fusils, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, and eighty-three pistols
why haven’t you put her in my bed so that i’d see her the moment i opened my eyes?
in a quiet, humdrum situation, thénardier had all it takes to play—we do not say to be—what passes for an honest tradesman, a decent burgher
we’re still in the rue de l’homme-armé
gavroche was still holding the cellar rat in his hand
this woman, as far as anyone could tell, must once have loved this man with whatever quotient of love was in her; but most likely, in the daily mutual rage provoked by the awful distress that ground the family down, that love had died
he wants to give me a surprise
they were thirsty; guillaume brought them something to drink
like you, reverend mother
regardless of the state, regardless of the laws, regardless of the prosperity and the insolence of others
it was a tilbury attached to a small white horse
fauchelevent cried out: lord!
marius asked: where’s the chief?
the fleming called his wife and told her all about it
of course, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of genius
bruneseau had set things in motion, but it needed choleranumber to spur the vast reconstruction that has taken place since
study evil amicably, note it, then cure it
one day cosette accidentally looked at herself in the mirror and let out a cry: well!
sire, said the minister of the interior to napoléon, yesterday i saw the boldest man in your empire
look at me, son
he saw nothing of all this: people who are overwhelmed with troubles never do look back
all of a sudden, he heard a racket behind him, the sound of running, cries of to arms!
the others could only see their immediate family, and that very rarely
but he did not abuse this knowledge in any way
now she’s a lady banker
it was clear that marius had his doubts about the origins of those six hundred thousand francs, that he feared some illicit source
he was timid to the point of seeming fierce, rarely went out, and saw no one but the poor who knocked on his window and his priest, the abbé mabeuf, who was a good old sort
in olden days a pianist used to punctuate segments of old burlesque movies; now the reality of scenes of everyday life needs to be subtitled in similar vein, the audio-visual ailning to put paid to the silence of vision in its entirety
'he dead too, though, and all who remain silent
was he beginning to waver, in bewilderment, over a touch of adventure?
as she swept the stairs, she stopped dead, forgetting her broom and the entire universe as she looked at this star shining at the bottom of her pocket
thénardier answered: she’s doing all right, i don’t know, leave me alone; i said, get lost
when she had finished, she remained pensive
when mass was over, marius remained pensive as he moved along; the old man came up again and said to him: i beg your pardon, monsieur, for having disturbed you a moment ago and for disturbing you again now, but you must have found me most annoying and so i must explain
marius, though, had to stay lying down on a chaise longue for over two months still, on account of the complications produced by the fractured collarbone
to hammer square formations, pulverize regiments, smash lines, grind and scatter massed formations—this was what it was all about for him, strike, strike, strike without letup, and he entrusted this task to the cannonball
while he wrote, the man talked out loud and marius heard what he said: to think there’s no equality, not even when you’re dead!
you receive him if you like, i don’t have much time for men of war in times of peace
what made the fault so enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed
father madeleine declined the cross
tholomyès was the original world-weary student
he had no court
there was not a soul in the woods or in the valley
from number to number, they had built number metres on average a year; since then they have built eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries of masonry every year using small materials with a bath of hydraulic cement poured over a concrete base
they whispered to each other, marius leaning forward on his chaise longue, cosette standing close by him
he’s a little thing from bas-boulonnais
they stepped down from the throne with gravity, but without authority; their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances that leave history with a sombre feeling; it did not have either the spectral calm of charles i,number or napoléon’s eagle cry
he retraced his steps
bewigged tragedynumber has its raison d’être and far be it from me to challenge its right to exist, as some do in the name of aeschylusnumber there are rough drafts in nature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies
blind, marius had followed the course he would have followed with his eyes wide open
so he didn’t love his father—what of it?
but it is up to society to save itself; it is to its own goodwill that we appeal
get cracking, said fauchelevent
it was with great difficulty that the old monarchical provostship and, in the last ten years of the eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, managed to tunnel out the five leagues of sewers that existed before number all kinds of obstacles got in the way of this operation, some to do with the nature of the soil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the working population of paris
for napoléon, it was pure panicfnnumber blücher sees nothing in it but excitement; wellington can’t make head or tail of it
the cellar rat, which smoked more than it shed light, made the inside of the elephant dimly visible
and that one fine day her nose will fall into her mouthnumber
these stockings, still gracefully moulded to the shape of little legs, were scarcely any longer than jean valjean’s hand
the french revolution is a move made by god
it had happened, it was all over; he saw all the monstrous aspects of his past come to life again, reappearing all around him, with all the frightening force of reality
the guide had replied in the negative
this had its drawbacks
beneath the gilding of the heavens i glimpse a destitute universe
this one was an officer
it is precisely a matter of reproducing these gestures and songs as they were, made or sung by men who are the same but also not who they were – that being the point
jean valjean was not dead
she answered him sobbing these words straight from paradise that are never more thrilling than when said through tears: i adore you!
she no longer had a bed, all she had left was a rag she called her bedspread, a mattress on the floor, and a chair with the cane seat missing
this particular rag-and-bone woman was a grateful old sack and she smiled—what a smile!—to the three porter women
the down on a peach, the frost on a plum, the radiate crystal of a snowflake, a butterfly’s wing powdered with feathers, are coarse things beside this chastity that does not even know it is chaste
i have to be there tonight
i won’t see her again
jean valjean did not utter a word
cosette laid her head on the good man’s shoulder and did not say a word
this man, who looked so much the man and yet cried like a woman, had struck the churchwarden
the candle was burned virtually to the bottom
there was once a greek painter named euphorion who was known as the painter of lips
madame campan quotes what a little girl of seven had to say to a big girl of sixteen, who took the head of the procession while she, the little girl, remained at the back: you may be a virgin, but i’m not
don’t expect me until the day after tomorrow
same age—he’s fifty-four, same height, same look, same man, in a word, it’s him
javert replied in his most imperious tone: why not right away?
i don’t know how to explain; me, i didn’t have any schooling, i’m a poor man
he even contributed to their misfortune, and he exacerbated it
at a given moment, any barricade that holds out inevitably becomes a raft of the medusa
the only thing that could clearly be discerned in his demeanor and on his countenance was a strange indecisiveness
cosette would outdo him
it was closed down soon after number montparnasse cemetery,number known as the east cemetery, has taken over from it, inheriting the famous watering hole bordering the vaugirard cemetery that used to have a wooden signboard over it with a quince painted on it; it had an l-shaped bar, with the tables of drinkers on one side and the graves on the other, and this sign: au bon coing—at the good quince
the door of the dining room, which, as we have seen, opened straight onto the square in front of the cathedral, was once as loaded with locks and bolts as the door of a prison
i am about to go into that dark night without even seeing her again
but you’d hold it against me, maybe, when we see each other again in a little while
but, when all’s said and done, what was true in the tales told about the first phase of monsieur myriel’s life?
from that moment on, his name was known
he walked with firm tread to the wall, pushed marius and the doctor aside when they tried to help him, took down the small copper crucifix from the wall where it was hanging, came back and sat down with all the ease of movement of a man in his prime, and said in a loud voice, laying the crucifix on the table: there is the great martyr
the first to reach the garden gate stopped and waited for the others; a second later, all six were gathered together
as soon as the chief orders everyone to man their stations, all chaotic movement ceases; no more skirmishing with one another; no more nattering huddles; no more private conversations; no more standing aloof; whatever is in everyone’s minds converges and turns into waiting for the assailant
in which you will read a delightful saying of the king’s
in toulon he was dressed in a red smock known as a paletot
the name thénardier, which monsieur leblanc did not seem to know, was known to marius
oh, the bastard’s cunning as a sewer rat
but you could not see anything of the outside
the real sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand five hundred francs
i’ve found the solution
javert felt his mind was about to snap
ah, you used to talk to me more friendly!
there aren’t any stars in the sky
people barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers fretted; all you heard was: oh, my god!
jean valjean had arranged himself to stay alive in there and he was more or less still breathing
this hankie belonged to the old monsieur, who had quite simply dropped it out of his pocket
a room where you bed down costs twenty sous; a room where you get some rest costs twenty francs
one evening in this same month of april, jean valjean had gone out and cosette had sat down on this bench after sunset
day was dawning when those inhabitants of montfermeil who were starting to open their doors saw walking by on the road to paris a shabbily dressed man hand in hand with a little girl all in mourning and carrying a big pink doll in her arms
what was the second man’s objective?
the innkeeper felt a shiver of joy
he went into a spin, furious
it’s an old cemetery that’s in breach of the regulations, it doesn’t have the uniform and it’s going to take retirement
monsieur gillenormand, who was as alive as it was possible to be in number, was one of those men who have become a curiosity solely because they have lived a long while, and who are odd because once upon a time they looked like everyone else and now they don’t look like anyone
cosette did not complain, she did not say a thing, she did not ask any questions, she did not seek any reason why; she had already reached the stage where you fear being found out or giving yourself away
he was a huge lazy force
this convent will be our salvation, he murmured
she had a way of coming out with quite grown-up little notions in her sweet infantile voice
meanwhile, you do what you can to alleviate the defect; you can even identify where the holes and hollows in the bore of a gun tube are by using calipers
explaining actually means two quite different things
it was the man’s hat
the cops are onto us, to boot, and there’s a gunner on the lookout
he took his head in his two hands but it was no good, he could not manage to explain it to himself
a bale of straw
with the human race rising upward, the lowest levels will emerge quite naturally from the zone of distress
not being able to say she was married, she was very careful, as we have already hinted, not to mention her little girl
i the lark’s field
i don’t believe i have the right to kill a man; but i feel i have a duty to exterminate evil
this is how, in the blindness of a bad political economy, we drown and let the well-being of all stream away and disappear in swallow holes
the shock of his fall had jolted the footropes and set them rocking like a swing
the man looked all around him, saw no one, dared not peer into that black corner, and stepped up the pace, frightened out of his wits
the judge repeated the question
at the same time our parents are appealing to us
who can this champmathieu be?
the blessed mezzocane, abbé of aquila, wanted to be buried beneath the gallows; that was done
love, you hold the future in your hands
the man was tall, dressed in a long redingote, and he had a cudgel under his arm
are you calling louis-philippe a tyrant?
twenty times, when he was in that carriage face-to-face with jean valjean, the legal tiger in him had roared
but it’ll still take a good quarter of an hour
he knew her eyes, her forehead, her beauty, her figure, her gait, but he did not know the sound of her voice
the ridge of the hump that determines which way the water flows follows an extremely capricious line
nature in the month of april is full of that glorious light that travels from the sky, the clouds, the trees, the meadows, and the flowers right into the heart of humankind
this small pellet falls into the courtyard
let’s not get carried away
scaling a wall and theft, it’s all there
this passerby did well to hurry, for very shortly afterwards, six men entered the rue plumet, creeping along the walls, separately and at some distance from each other, looking for all the world like a drunken patrol
every good girl contains a hero
the fact is that it got no higher on average than six or seven feet
the true division of humanity is this: those filled with light and those filled with darkness
if his wish had been granted, if he had at that moment seen cosette ogling a lancer, he would have died of pain without being able to utter a word
in the face of such absolute assertion, mother jondrette lifted her big ruddy blond head and looked up at the ceiling with a twisted expression
the night probably knew more about him than the day
monsieur gillenormand would have liked marius to throw himself into his arms
there had already been more than one chapter in their barely begun romantic novel, and the amorous young man who was called adolphe in the first chapter turned into alphonse in the second and gustave in the third
he was going to get himself killed
that was the question
if such a feeling still exists in you, and i hope it does, reflect before you answer me, consider, on the one hand, this man whom a word from you may destroy, and on the other hand, justice, which a word from you may clarify
times are certainly hard!
it was not serious and he would not allow anyone to look at it, or bandage it, or even to see that he was in pain, not even cosette
in the absence of inspector javert, i believe i should remind the gentlemen of the jury what he said in this very place a few hours ago
enjolras resumed: the position’s good, the barricade is beautiful
but what they were attacking was the younger branch of divine right in louis-philippe, just as they had attacked the elder branch in charles x; and what they wanted to overthrow in overthrowing royalty in france, as we explained, was the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over justice throughout the world
there is, in this way of living, some good mingled with the bad, for if enfeeblement is harmful, generosity is healthful and good
homer would have tied up polyphemus with it, shakespeare, calibannumber
montparnasse gave him a wink
normally this flame that burns us also enlightens us a little, shedding a little helpful light around us
we saw him hotfooting it out of town
what is this place?
it looks like we’ve got a common interest
but the historian must also take what was written in the language of words and with the tools of rhetoric and re-read it, delving beneath what the words say and dredging up what they say without thinking, what they say as monuments, as opposed to what they say intentionally
was made with a faith so profound, with so much certainty, with such a total lack of anxiety and doubt, that he could find no words
in this way, they reckon, it can have peace after its revolution, that is, time to bandage its wounds and get its house in order
he thought he’d been too kind, too soft, we might as well say it, too weak
then he stuck the shovel in the ground and added: you see, it’s going to be a cold night tonight and the dead woman’s going to give us a piece of her mind if we plant her here without a cover
i answered: we did have; among others monsieur de lucenet, who was captain of the old city gates at pontarlier under the ancien régime
in the days when he still went out, he had bought a little copper crucifix for a few sous from a coppersmith and he had hung it on a nail facing his bed
one of the survivors of the expedition, a smart sewer worker, very young at the time, was still a few years ago telling anyone who’d listen the curious details that bruneseau thought it best to leave out of his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of the administrative style
i’m in love with the character over the road from my place
as for éponine, javert saw to it that she was nabbed again
he said abruptly: what have you come here for?
revolutionary fever was gaining, in any case
it got to the point at a certain moment, while my brother was talking about the mountain folk of pontarlier who have sweet work close to the heavens and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, where he stopped short, fearing that in that word that had escaped his lips there was something that could rub the man the wrong way
i took the bowl of the clay pipe,
marius, feverish, his stomach empty, his every hope shed, one after the other, stranded in grief, the darkest of shipwrecks, awash with violent emotions, and feeling the end near, had sunk deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor that always preludes the fatal hour when it is willed and welcomed
that which sits up there, at the top, at the summit, at the zenith, that which pours so much light over the earth, might actually see little, see badly, see not at all?
nearly all the stagecoaches heading for the south and the west took the champs-élysées in those days
trying to outdo mere representation by offering the very presence oj the event, as instantaneous photography vvould do, followed by the photo- finish and the first cinematographic newsreels of the lumiere brothers and, ultimately, the live coverage offered by cnn
fantine, who had not taken her eyes off javert, wheeled around: did i say anything to you?
gavroche’s adventure, which remained in the traditions of the temple quartier, is one of the most terrible memories of the old bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their reminiscences: night attack on the post of the imprimerie royale
at times, he probably actually laughed to himself and talked out loud
bahorel shouted: flock—that’s a polite way of saying sheep
it does seem, indeed, that certain people are endowed with a real animal instinct, pure and intact like all instincts, that creates antipathies and affinities, that fatally divides one personality from another, that does not hesitate, that is never in doubt, is never silenced and never flags, clear in its obscurity, infallible, imperious, resistant to all the counsels of intelligence and all the solvents of reason and that, whatever their fates may be, secretly alerts the dog-man to the presence of the cat-man, and the fox-man to the presence of the lion-man
madame magloire, said the bishop, set one more place
thénardier was a different man now
the door was the one in the visitors’ room reserved for the gardener in the course of his duties
at times her unbuttoned and torn chemise nearly fell down to her waist
all eyes followed him
he had to tackle holly, nettles, hawthorn, dog roses, thistles, the meanest of brambles, and got himself scratched to bits
citizens, said enjolras, what that man did is horrifying and what i did is horrible
fantine asked him: what did the doctor say?
napoléon was used to staring hard at war; he never did the poignant sums of details, figure by figure; figures mattered little to him, as long as they amounted to this total: victory
the porter did not seem to understand either javert’s words or jean valjean’s signs
a sewer is a misunderstanding
madame victurnien sometimes saw her going by her window, noticed the distress of that creature, put in her place thanks to her, and was very pleased with herself
the historian of customs and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
real misery, he had just seen
grantaire had risen to his feet
the next day jean valjean threw marius the glance marius finally caught
jean valjean looked as though he were about to pass out
two were bolder still
that is indeed the question at the dawn of the millennium
that doesn’t stop him from defending it, retorted enjolras
one of these flags was red and blue with an imperceptible white stripenumber in between
a hundred and nine francs fifteen sous
otherwise, the days went by, one after the other, and nothing new cropped up
in the cloister, games were heavenly
he managed to vanish, sold the bishop’s silver, keeping only the candlesticks as mementos, crept from town to town, travelled across france, turned up in montreuil-sur-mer, had the bright idea we’ve mentioned above, achieved what we’ve outlined, managed to make himself unassailable and inaccessible and from then on, well established in montreuil-sur-mer, happy to feel his conscience burdened by his past and the first half of his existence belied by this new phase, he lived a quiet life, reassured and hopeful, having only two concerns: to hide his name and to sanctify his life; to escape the clutches of men and to return to god
the woman had murdered her child, infanticide was proved, the jury ruled out premeditation, she was sentenced to life
i can’t remember which philosopher it was who said: there is never any shortage of old women
i’ll stop this miserable bastard when i’m good and ready, he thought
my child, that is quite a load you’re carrying there, for you
over that way, you don’t pick the grapes ripe
number, he came to a tavern with this sign hanging on the outside: aux quatre vents
he seemed to stop looking or thinking
he was forced to make a mental effort to remember that all that surrounded him was real
the tiny one had his eyes open, but he didn’t say a word
cosette hung her head and went to get an empty bucket sitting in the corner of the fireplace
the riot had wreathed everything in its smoke
these words of francis bacon's, taken from david sylvester's interviews with the artist and quoted as a lead-in for the  amodern starts' exhibition at the museum of modern art in new york, , beautifully sum up the current dilemma: the less you represent, the more you push the simulacrum of representation!
she keeps the inn
he rushed to the window that looked on the street, opened it with his shaky old hands, leaned out down to the waist while basque and nicolette held him from behind, and cried: marius!
in nearly all the songs from the galleys, penal colonies, and penitentiaries of the eighteenth century, you find a diabolical and puzzling gaiety
from now on i can do nothing more for her
i want you to keep your job
all that seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind a theatre curtain
a quartet of crooks, claquesous, gueulemer, babet, and montparnasse, ruled the dregs of paris from number to number
i must have forgotten it
no doubt the poetic voice off that accompanies the images voices the suffering of the earth and of a life that aspires to resume the course of its thoughts’
this will do for my dinner today, he thought
the shot went off, the bullet passed through his hand and perhaps through the workman, too, for he fell, but the bullet did not reach marius
everyone has noticed how swiftly a coin you drop on the ground rolls away and hides and how cleverly it makes itself unfindable
these epochs are singular and manage to baffle politicians who hope to exploit them
… well, then, monsieur, my worthy monsieur, do you know what is going to happen tomorrow?
i won’t ask you any more questions
jondrette does his shopping
it seems that around these great centres of the movement of people, at the rolling of these powerful machines, at the breathing of these monstrous horses of civilization that eat coal and vomit fire, the seed-filled earth trembles and opens in order to swallow up the former dwellings of men and let the new ones out
so, who gives two hoots?
it rolls there in wide and terrible corrugations; it gathers and builds; the torrent charges at the piles of the bridges as though to rip them out with fat liquid ropes
the old legitimist parties nonetheless assailed the revolution of number with all the violence that comes from false reasoning
the sun was going down and appetite was fading
marius was truly astounded
then he found himself back in his room, and he put his candle down on a table
i always thought there was something bad at the bottom of all that
when at two o’clock the royal carriage, surrounded by a squadron of silver-trimmed guards of the royal corps, came into the boulevard after skirting around la salpêtrière hospital, he appeared startled and almost alarmed
where there was once the battered old rattletrap there is now the railway car; where there was once the rickety old two-masted cutter, there is now the steamboat; today we say fécamp the way we once said saint-cloudnumber the paris of number is a city that has the whole of france as its suburbs
gavroche’s bed sat under the mesh as in a cage
no one ever knew how he managed to get into the courtyard without going through the carriage entrance
thanks to the traveller’s fifty-seven francs, thénardier was able to avoid a cautionnumber and to honour his signature
you’ll see if there won’t be miracles galore here, father fauvent!
it was almost night
the jondrette girl’s eyes had gone from forlorn to joyful and from joyful to grim
cosette did not know what love was
this is a stroke of luck, said courfeyrac
can you be too happy?
he was in hungary, in , in a tank
babet was skinny and smart
the first thing cosette felt was a confused and deep sadness
you don’t really imagine that people die just like that?
for marius, listening to cosette talk fashion;
thénardier resumed: let’s get it over with, then
my brother is so good
are you headed for arras?
they did not doubt their success any more than they doubted their cause
too much zeal is the death of peach trees and apricots
i absolutely have to marry her, i’d go mad otherwise
then there was the bundle of clothes already put together in advance for the little girl, that was very strange—there had to be any amount of mystery behind that
we are unlearning certain things and that is all to the good, as long as in unlearning this, you learn that
this whole prodigious city is a condensation of dead customs and creeds and living customs and creeds
the carter was so moved by the five-franc coin that he left his glass where it was and came running over
but its director, humphrey jennings, had a singular take on his work of propaganda for a country resisting the enemy's bombs
at this point, cosette sobbed even harder
doctor, he’s coming back!
montparnasse went on: i’m goin’ to find babet
what can you say, meanwhile, about the likes of richard hiilsen- beck, one of the founding fathers of dada, who told a berlin audience in , at a conference on the new trends in art, 'vve were for the war
the riots brought the cloudy skies back, they made that revolution, initially so remarkable for its unanimity, degenerate into a brawl
thénardier registered the movement and went on at the slow pace of an orator who holds his audience in the palm of his hand and feels his enemy squirming under his words: this man was forced to go into hiding, though for reasons that have nothing to do with politics, and he’d taken the sewer as his place of residence and had a key to it
by another natural consequence, the closer he came to his father, to his memory, and to the things for which the colonel had fought for twenty-five years, the further away he moved from his grandfather
the moment you hear the cab stop, open up straightaway, he’ll come up, you’ll light the stairs and the hall, and when he comes in here, go straight back down again and pay the driver and send the cab on its way
he said of the school portal: what a fine old man!
unbeknown to him, the mayor of montreuil-sur-mer enjoyed a kind of celebrity
volume by volume, the whole library went south
try and take away the dog the lion has in its cage!
come on, what is it?
too much misery, as we have noted, had turned him into something of a visionary
universal suffrage has a wonderful way of dissolving the riot’s raison d’être, and by giving insurrection the vote, it takes away its weapons
cosette was huddled against him, trembling
if you don’t buy my painting, dear benefactor, jondrette wailed, i’ll be without resources, there’ll be nothing left for me to do but throw myself in the river
it happened very smoothly
philosophy has to be an energy, with the aim and effect of improving man
so, what about the surprise?
you’ll be crawling on your stomach through the scrub and you’ll eat grass like the brutes of the woods
louis xi is there with tristan, françois i is there with duprat, charles ix is there with his mother, richelieu is there with louis xiii, louvoisnumber is there, letellier is there, hébert and maillardnumber are there, scraping stones and trying to make all traces of their actions disappear

monsieur madeleine turned toward the jurors and toward the court and said in a soft voice: gentlemen of the jury, let the accused go
from time to time, he shook his head as though answering some question he had silently put to himself
the emperor, pleased, shouted to him: you are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the légion d’honneur!

the walls were white, the tables were black; these two colours of mourning are the only choices convents have
we couldn’t care less
meanwhile the fiacre rolled along
jean valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his curbstone
i end up with great heaps in me room
with what despairing ravishment he contemplated that convent garden, full of flowers blooming unseen and incarcerated virgins, where all the perfumes and all the souls wafted straight up to heaven!
he told himself that he was happy that it was not there, that it had disappeared, that this was good, that this was only right, that his grandfather had been the true keeper of his father’s flame and that it was better that the colonel’s sword had been sold to the highest bidder, sold to a junk dealer, tossed among old scrap iron, rather than to cause the flank of his homeland to bleed today
my name is pontmercy

badly, answered jondrette, with a terribly distressed and grateful smile, very badly, my worthy monsieur
the fortress was complete

this repression was not accomplished without noise, without that tumultuous racket peculiar to clashes between the army and the people
they ripped officers’ epaulets off
you like apple turnovers, mesdames, but don’t eat too many of them
this thénardier, if you took him at his word, had been a soldier—a sergeant, he claimed; he had probably taken part in the campaign of number, and even acquitted himself quite bravely, so it would seem
from that moment, as we saw, he was a different man
everyone on the job
one day she said to jean valjean: father, let’s take a stroll down there for a bit
for many years now, from the time my hair turned white, i’ve sensed that many people think they have the right to look on me with contempt; for the poor ignorant hordes, i wear the face of the damned and, hating no one, i accept the isolation hate brings

he was obviously surprised that a man could talk like that

he endured it, exasperated
no pocket was so dingy it did not hold a bit of money, no abode so poor it did not enjoy a bit of joy
the day after a wedding is lonely
i’m going up to my room
she broke off, not daring to go any further

on the side of the french, in this battle of the cuirassiers, delord, l’héritier, colbert, dnop, travers, and blancard were out of action, but on the side of the english, alten was wounded, barne was wounded, delancey was killed, van meeren was killed, ompteda was killed, wellington’s entire staff was decimated, and england came off worse in this bloody juggling act

then she opened the window and ran her eyes all around, hoping to be able to turn up something of the street, a corner of a house, a patch of pavement, and be able to watch for marius there
gavroche buried his fist in another of his pockets and pulled out a note folded in four

enjolras was more manly
that said, she curtseyed to marius and to jean valjean

be that as it may, dripping with sweat, drenched with rain, his clothes in tatters, his hands skinned raw, his elbows bleeding, his knees torn to shreds, thénardier had reached what children, in their figurative language, call the sharp edge of the wall of the ruin, he had lain on it stretched out to full length and there, at that point, his strength had failed him

it was an improvisation thrown up by ferment
as soon as they were alone, old man thénardier offered the traveller a chair
he began by passing judgment on himself
and who knows, anyhow?
he prescribed an infusion of pure quinine and, if she became feverish again overnight, a soothing potion
you can take me, for here i am
everyone milled around gavroche
of a poor lover who hanged himselfnumber
marius had not left his place
the first cry of the enlightened and growing hordes is: death to thieves!
it’s all coming along nicely, replied jondrette, but my feet are frozen
there was a blow with a stick
there’s been a mistake, i’m telling you
this other lifer, who had come straight from jail and who was dressed in red like chenildieu, was a peasant from lourdes, half man, half pyrenees bear
you didn’t see a sort of godforsaken rodentlike little muscadinnumber of a fop getting about over that way by any chance, did you?
let’s do our duty!
what can i do?
you can go straight in
marius had got into the habit of walking down this path without thinking
since the restoration contests this title, which i have paid for with my blood, my son will take it and bear it
she was born at montreuil-sur-mer
it was the sound of muskets being cocked
marius had vanished; it was over, what could she do?
i made lint all the time, here, monsieur, see, it’s all your fault, i’ve got calluses on my fingers
they’re a bunch of vermin
the winds of change blow there as irresistibly as everywhere else
so why go there?
the silence of the redoubt was probably beginning to worry the besiegers, causing them to fear some unexpected development, and they were probably feeling the need to see clearly through that heap of cobblestones and to know what was going on behind that impassable wall that took fire without returning it
toussaint had replied, stunned
she preferred an hour with him to her ravishing tête-à-têtes with catherine
he had barely finished when mother thénardier, indeed, rushed into the room, flushed, winded, panting, her eyes ablaze, and shouted, whacking both her thighs at once with her huge hands: false address!
he blessed and was blessed in return
i never twist anything
he felt the tug of an unknown feeling
jean valjean had some trouble moving and walking
the two men, chatting away standing-stock still in the snow that was swirling down, formed an association that a police sergeant would definitely have kept his eye on but that marius barely noticed
she grabbed the handle with both hands
he said to the man: why is the bread here so bitter?
the hospital was a low, narrow, single-story house with a small garden
her creditors were harassing her
and there were all kinds of little treats on top of that
or the short straw!
then his eyes dropped to the four uniforms
little by little, for some time, he had been moving away from strict dogma and venturing into the wider fields of progress, and he had even come to accept, as a definitive and magnificent evolution, the transformation of the great republic of france into the vast republic of humanity
he cleared away the stones, lifted out the grate, loaded marius, inert as a corpse, onto his shoulders, and with this burden on his back, he dropped down into this sort of luckily fairly shallow well, using his elbows and his knees, let the heavy iron trapdoor fall shut over his head and the stones roll back over it again, and found his footing on the flagstone surface ten feet below ground
the amphictyonsnumber held two sessions a year, one in delphi, home of the gods, the other in thermopylae, home of the heroes
he said to himself: when i’ve finished my balls of blue, i’ll be rich, i’ll get my copperplates out of hock, i’ll get my flora back on the shelves with a bit of charlatanism, some hefty handouts under the counter, and a few ads in the papers, and i’ll buy, and i know exactly where, a copy of pierre de médine’s the art of sailing, the edition of number, with woodcuts
i ask nothing more
his slithering, his bearing, his mysterious darting movements caused him to resemble those crepuscular spectres that haunt ruins and that old norman legends call alleurs—goers

a crisis was obviously brewing

the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy
the bell tower of what was once their village forgot them; the boundary of what was once their field forgot them; after a few years’ sojourn in jail, jean valjean himself forgot them
third: tailing is good, with relays of officers at intervals, but for important occasions, there ought to be at least two officers who do not lose sight of one another, so that if, for any reason, an officer takes sick on the job, the other can keep watch over him and stand in for him
the bourgeois talked peacably with the workers about what was ginnying up
after checking five or six housefronts barricaded in this fashion, the kid shrugged his shoulders and tackled the matter with himself in these terms: i’ll be buggered!
there was a stove in one corner burning away with glowing embers you could see
bossuet burst out laughing
the old man had had a shock and had given as good as he got, and so terribly that, in the blink of an eye, assailant and assailed had switched places
he always got away, sometimes resisting with violence
marius was a bronze vase, but old man gillenormand was an iron pot
citizen, i gave the letter to the porter
the simpleminded police of the restoration tended to view the people of paris through rose-coloured glasses
thénardier helped jean valjean get marius back on his shoulders, then he headed for the gate on his bare feet, tiptoeing, beckoning to jean valjean to follow him; he peered outside, placed a finger to his lips and remained sort of suspended for a few seconds; the inspection done, he put the key in the lock
when she entered this hovel, she filled it with paradise
well, then, jean valjean continued, keep the money for your mother

she glanced at it

the pampas of south america would appeal to me, if i didn’t have the arcades of the odéon
from his window he could see the courtyard in front of the house and the street
he put the supporting evidence in his pocket
it had projections, corners, black holes, recesses where the roof dipped down, bays, and ridges jutting out
some say a trumpet blast was heard sounding the charge from the direction of the arsenal, others that a boy stabbed a dragoon with a dagger
after a pause, gavroche added: for the little ones i’ll use a ladder
she started to tidy the tables; the husband paced up and down the room
daring deeds dazzle history and are guiding lights for mankind
on june number, number, his family took flight and hid in the woods
no one and everyone
enjolras shook his hand with a smile
and then, above all, marius felt inexpressibly revolted in thinking that it was monsieur gillenormand who, for entirely stupid reasons, had torn him mercilessly from the colonel, thereby depriving the father of the son and the son of the father
and so, he shut himself up in it, he lived in it, he was utterly happy there, leaving aside the prodigious questions that lure and terrify, the unfathomable perspectives of abstraction, the heady precipices of metaphysics, all these profundities that converge, for the apostle, on god, and, for the atheist, on nothingness: fate, good and evil, the war of being against being, man’s conscience, the pensive sleepwalking of animals, transformation by death, the summing up of existences in the grave, the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the enduring self, essence, substance, being and nothingness, the soul, nature, freedom, necessity—thorny problems that are sheer drops, murky depths, over which the colossal archangels of the human mind hover; awesome abysses that the likes of lucretius, manu, saint-paul, and dantenumber contemplate with blazing eyes that, by staring hard at infinity, seem to cause stars to hatch there
bossuet shouted to the gunners
was anarchy now about to descend from on high?
i want to stay
he cast a furtive glance at the door as though he feared it might open despite the bar that held it shut tight; then with an abrupt and violent move, he grabbed in a single armful, without so much as a quick glance at them, these things he had so religiously and perilously hoarded for so many years, and took the lot, rags, stick, haversack, and threw them on the fire
he also made his way out of the garden, walking backward, obliged, to keep the dog’s respect, to resort to that manoeuvre with the stick that masters of this style of fencing call la rose couverte
say everything’s fine and i’ll be right down
still the little boy could not get to sleep: monsieur?
i mean that man has a tyrant, ignorance
who was going to worry about that?
we need to reform and transform
dada today is still for war
as his mouth was alluring, his lips the most rosy red and his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile made up for what was severe in his whole physiognomy
sixth: the detainees, known as barkers, that call the other detainees to the visitors’ room, make the prisoner pay them two sous to call out their name clearly
he looked ahead as far as the eye could see and saw nothing
he would say with authority: the french revolution was a bunch of rotters
he was about halfway down the street, level with a very low wall that you could step over in certain places and that bordered a patch of wasteland, and he was walking along slowly, preoccupied as he was, the snow muffling his footfalls, when, all of a sudden, he heard voices talking quite close by
the man opened the wallet and pulled out, not a fistful of banknotes as thénardier had hoped, but a simple bit of paper, which he unfolded and presented, open, to the innkeeper, saying: you’re right
he was antinous,number wild
after all, a person has the right to rob a corpse he has made
this weakness had led him to make a foolish concession
it is its antechamber; but, like rich people who display their greatest riches at the entrance to their palace, it seems that death, which is close at hand, puts its greatest miseries in this, its vestibule
he seized éponine by the arm
gavroche was stuck for a reply, so he stayed there, undecided and scratching his ear sadly
but i just can’t stop myself from congratulating you
you can talk to me, it doesn’t wear me out
but perpetual movement still remains the rule
we are describing the state of a mind on the move
to die of love is to live from it
nearly all the trees in the orchard were wildings; he budded them and got them to yield excellent fruit
twice a year, on the first of january and on saint george’s feast day, marius wrote dutiful letters to his father that his aunt dictated and that you would have said were copied from some manual; this was all monsieur gillenormand would tolerate; and the father answered with overwhelmingly tender letters that the old man pocketed without reading
the old biddies gave up the ghost, saying: after all, he’s a sort of adventurer

it was as though something of the repose of the dead had entered into jean valjean’s tranquillity
he bought the watch for forty-five francs
he saw what he saw, and that was that

fauchelevent wiped his forehead
but she declared that she was the first to detest them, and then again, she had reached her ferociously devout phase

the years end up giving a head a windswept look that is most distinguished
we have already pointed out this typical detail
i have my writer’s stall in the market in the rue de sèvres
there is nothing harder to drill through and penetrate than the geological formation that the marvellous historical formation known as paris sits on top of; as soon as work, in any shape or form, begins and ventures into that nappe of alluvial sediment, subterranean resistance abounds in the form of liquid clays, springs, hard rock, the soft deep silt that the special science calls mustard
she seemed to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her
the man was evidently beyond the reach of horror or desperation
as we’ve already explained, with first love, you take the soul well before the body; later on you take the body well before the soul, sometimes you don’t take the soul at all; the faublases and the prudhommesnumber add: because there isn’t one; but happily this bit of sarcasm is blasphemy

on the first floor, hold your axes ready to cut off the staircase
he still had his yellow redingote, his black breeches, and his old hat
you can’t shock a people into going any faster than they want to go
but the grapes can’t have been ripe?
what am i after now?

she handed it to her husband
his laugh was faint and chilling and gave marius goosebumps
let’s admit without bitterness that the individual has his own distinct self-interest, and can without committing a crime make that interest clear and defend it; the present has its excusable dose of egotism; the life of the moment has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself endlessly to the future
what the hell is that?
a year went by, then another
why, with so much money in his purse, the miserable getup?

you’re not talking, marius shot back, about that miserable petty theft of forty years ago, expiated, as appears from your very own newspapers, by a whole lifetime of repentance, self-denial, and good?
you write it yourself
he was supposed to occupy courfeyrac’s chambers, which were decent and where a certain number of law books, bolstered and filled out by odd volumes of novels, made up the library required by the regulations
jean valjean took the risk of sticking his nose out to look round the corner into the street
you’ll get yourself robbed, ma bougon used to say
the prioress, usually dammed up by silence, and now having a surplus in her reservoir, stood and shouted with the loquacity of an opened sluice gate: on my right, i have benedict and on my left, bernard
his mind was elsewhere and where your mind is, your eyes follow
you would have said it was the tatters of a whole populace, rags made of wood, iron, bronze, stone that the faubourg saint-antoine had shovelled there at its doorstep with one colossal sweep of the broom, turning its misery into a barricade
what are you going to do?
she could hardly lift the bucket
this is a profound and useful truth to know, one the stuarts did not have an inkling of in number and the bourbons did not have a clue about even in number
at the corner of the rue de bourdonnais there were no more lanterns
you need the useless for happiness
there were instantly several versions of the story, which had wound up being described as a case of child-snatching
now there’s a good book for you, said monsieur gillenormand
they had not been able to figure it out
you think this poor unfortunate convict has only a sou to his name; not so, he has liberty
how do you work that out?
not long after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the top plank, jean valjean felt himself being carted out, then rolling along
and so he came to the prefecture, followed by the seminary
the interior, calm again, is strange

listen, she said, you’re wrong
clearly he is not on the right track; he stops to get his bearings
listen to me, friend
it was, indeed, him
as you like, father, said cosette
he was familiar with its tradition as though he had been a witness to it
now our two bedrooms, which used to be covered with old wallpaper whitewashed with lime, would not be out of place in a château as fine as your own
fantine had had a night of fever and insomnia—full of happy images, though; in the morning, she fell asleep
trophonius’s vat holds nothing not found in mesmer’s tub; ergaphilas is resurrected in cagliostro; the brahmin vasaphanta is incarnated in the comte de saint-germain; saint-médard cemetery supplies miracles every bit as good as those of the umumiya mosque of damascus
chance would have it that the heads of their beds leaned against the chimney flue
cosette gave nothing away
next to the french doors, a great big table with an inkstand, piled high with papers all in a heap and enormous tomes
the first, feeling himself to be the weaker, avoided the second, but he avoided him in a profoundly furious fashion; anyone observing him closely would have seen his eyes shining with the glum hostility of a man in flight and with all the menace there is in fear
the moon shone right on jean valjean’s wildly frightened face
i thought it was just a fling, but it looks like it’s real passion

this was fauchelevent, jean valjean, and cosette
as for the strong emotion he experienced shortly after being back under the turf roof of his road-mender’s hut again, this was it:
the fireplace and the table with the two chairs sat exactly facing marius
mabeuf, the churchwarden, whom he went to see again, had given him an account of life in vernon, the colonel’s retirement, his flowers, his loneliness

he’s as white as a plucked chicken
marius sat down and gestured for him to sit
it’s her mother that entrusted her to me, i can only hand her over to her mother
now, we will say in all conscience, louis-philippe being in good faith in his tenure, and democracy being in good faith in its assault, the degree of horror that attaches to the social struggles cannot be charged either to the king or to the democracy
i was wondering when you’d get to it
surely this small enclosure, with the sky as a ceiling, was enough to enable him to worship god by regarding his loveliest works and his most sublime works, one by one?
a thief, since he robbed a rich manufacturer, monsieur madeleine, whose ruin he caused
monsieur leblanc said nothing
its metaphors are sometimes so shameless you can feel they have been in shackles
and what did it mean?
the result was the whiteness we mentioned, a whiteness that bathed even her lips and eyes in its radiance
this was more than monsieur gillenormand could bear to hear
and now, at the very moment he was about to deliver a brigand, in the middle of perpetrating a crime, to the legal authorities, destiny screamed at him: but it’s thénardier!
marius reached the church, but did not go in; instead he turned and went behind the chevet
i do: i’m thrilled!
the old man addressed did not stir
jean valjean’s wound had been a diversion
the poor mother hung her head
the same artery was throbbing everywhere
he watched in alarm as the kind of frightening calm that the injustice of his rotten fate had produced melted away inside him
on top of the national guard
vvhat can you say about the 'talkies' and about the sound-track that pu ts the finishing touches on the effect of mastery of th,e image track, except that they are a lot more harmful than people realize?
then he pushed the dead body away with his foot and said: throw that outside
he was so bedazzled that everything else had been wiped from his brain
he would have died at thermopylae with leonidas and would have burned drogheda with cromwellnumber
or you’ll have to deal with cosette
it was a white paper envelope
you are so beautiful!
sometimes, while getting the little girl to spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing wrong in mind that he had learned to read in jail

marius was there from now on to carry out the job of providence by cosette’s side

anyone passing through the small town of vernonnumber in those days and taking a stroll over the beautiful monumental bridge that will soon be replaced, let’s hope, by some hideous wrought-iron affair, would have been able to see, if they looked down from the parapet, a man of about fifty wearing a leather cap and dressed in trousers and a jacket of coarse grey woolen cloth, to which something yellow was sewn which had once been a red ribbon, shod in clogs, weathered by the sun, his face almost black and his hair almost white, with a large scar across his forehead that ran on down his cheek, bent, buckled, old before his time, strolling around virtually all day, with a spade or a billhook in hand, inside one of those walled plots of land right next to the bridge that line the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces—lovely enclosures full of flowers that you would describe as gardens if they were a lot bigger, and, if they were a lot smaller, as bouquets
a few constellations here and there in the pale, deep sky, the earth all black, the sky all white, a shiver rippling through the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious rush and sudden chill of dawn light
when he was nabbed again, the new severities inflicted on him only served to make him wilder
you said to yourself: damn it!
woe to anyone who happened to be within arm’s reach then!

she let her head fall on marius’s knees and her eyelids closed
marius took no notice of these symptoms
what about you, monsieur le vétéran, you must have been wounded quite a bit?
napoléon came into his own as the ogre of corsica there; later on, the entry into history of monsieur le marquis buonaparté, lieutenant general of the king’s armies, was a concession to the spirit of the age

no other city has enjoyed the kind of domination that sometimes scoffs at those it subjugates
and that is because—i suspected as much a long time ago—you’re hiding something and you want to keep it hidden
marius found it hard to believe that the fauchelevent of the barricade was the same as this fauchelevent of flesh and blood, so gravely seated by cosette’s side
suddenly everything became clear, and he admitted this: that his place in the galleys was empty, that no matter what he did, it was still waiting for him, that robbing petit-gervais led him straight back there, that the empty place was waiting for him and would pull at him until he was back in it, that this was inevitable and fatal
you’re carrying a child there who can walk
it would give montparnasse a good laugh
he did not know arras, the streets were dingy, and he wandered around aimlessly
yet, should the sheep’s mange cause the shepherd to recoil?
the barricade, now walled in on three streets, in front on the rue de la chanvrerie, to the left on the rue du cygne and the rue de la petite-truanderie, to the right on the rue mondétour, really was now almost impregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in
we told them at home that we’d taken the letters to the people and they told us, nothing doing!
the old woman beetled off, the old man remained alone
you felt disconcerted the first time you set eyes on these two forests flanking those two cavernous holes
what a mournful instant it is when society withdraws and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being!
thanks to their offshoots and to the underlying network of their contacts, babet, gueulemer, claquesous, and montparnasse ran the general ambush business of the entire département of the seinenumber they performed the coups d’état of the underworld on unsuspecting passersby
outside that sacred thing, justice, by what right does one form of war scorn another?
a cry went up: it’s the voter!
the kid went over to this pensive character and began circling around him on tiptoe the way you walk when you’re frightened of waking someone up
fauchelevent was giving the unexpected gribier the once-over again
these cobblestones leave riot only their mud
what a fatal coincidence!
once more the interior of the jondrette rathole came into view
he thought it was better not to attract the father’s attention
there was in her veins the blood of the bohemian and the adventurer who goes about barefoot

she put the bucket on the ground, stuck her hand in her hair and began to slowly scratch her head, a gesture peculiar to children who are terrified and undecided
do you know, monsieur?
the lark was the name that, in the depths of marius’s melancholy, had replaced ursula
he was overcome, he would have liked to be stunningly handsome, he would have liked to be wearing the cross of the légion d’honneur
i hope, for the sake of the tale’s clarity, we may be allowed to resort to a simple device already used on waterloo
he came across several doors but they were closed
her heart said nothing
o relentless march of human society!
now, that’s what i call a leap!
my very dear friend, monsieur montparnasse, said éponine, please, you’re a good boy, don’t go in!
god, who is always within man, and resistant, he the true conscience, to the false, stopping the spark from going out, ordering the sunbeam to remember the sun, enjoining the soul to recognize the true absolute when faced with the fictitious absolute; indestructible humanity, the inadmissible human heart, that splendid phenomenon, the most beautiful perhaps of our inner wonders, did javert understand it?
suddenly his dull eyes blazed with a hideous fire, the little man straightened up and became terrifying; he took a step toward monsieur leblanc and bellowed at him in a thundering voice: but never mind all that!
the father was laughing, the toddler was laughing, the mother was smiling
both cosette and marius, speechless with anguish, not knowing what to say to death, desperate and trembling, stood before him, cosette giving marius her hand
he saw mabeuf fall again, he heard gavroche sing under the grapeshot, he felt the coldness of éponine’s forehead against his lips; enjolras, courfeyrac, jean prouvaire, combeferre, bossuet, grantaire, all his friends rose before him, then evaporated
they had swapped as many secrets as they could but that did not get them much further than their names
they eat that up
should a person make it to some other exit, he would find it blocked off by some other plug or grate
it was a serene benevolence, flowing over all people, as we have seen, and sometimes extending even to things
i’ll come and get you there
one night, he was alone in his little room under the eaves
you see, monsieur pontmercy, i’ve been through a bit in life
not on your life
and he continued to advance toward her
two names anticipated by la fontainenumber the opportunity was too good for the legal fraternity attached to the law courts not to have a good laugh about it, and a parody immediately made the rounds of the galleries of the palais de justice, in somewhat lame verse:
the insurgents, all geared up for the imminent attack, had their backs turned
the former ss camp warden himself recalls the work song the inmates were made to sing in treblinka
aunt gillenormand gave up all attempts and arrived at this profound diagnosis: my father never loved my sister much after her silly mistake
the prioress’s face, till then worried and dark, became once more serene
we’ve got so many outlays
yet the one with the key parlayed, solely to gain time
young girls who have no bread—that’s a terrible thing
if only i make it to the barricade in time!
waving away the brigands who still had their hands on monsieur leblanc, he said: back off a bit and let me have a chat with the gentleman
he was still in the same position, his chest doubled over the table, his head lying flat on his arms, surrounded by glasses, tankards, and bottles
on the part of the egoists, prejudice, the glumness of a rich education, a growing appetite based on intoxication, the giddiness of a prosperity that deadens, a fear of suffering that, in some people, reaches the point of aversion for those who suffer, an implacable self-satisfaction, the ego so inflated that it blocks out the soul; on the part of the miserable, covetousness, envy, hate at seeing others having fun, the deep pull of the human animal toward personal gratification, hearts filled with fog, sadness, want, fatalism, ignorance impure and simple
just as soon as he could
well, it’s time for revenge
he started to stammer like a madman: true?
the art of the motor - cinematographic, video- computer graphic - has finally torpedoed the lack of motorization of the 'primary arts'
this bestowing of speech upon images, upon the whirling rush offilm, meant unwittingly triggering a phenomenon of panic in which the audio-visual would gradually lead to this silence of the lambs whereby the art lover becomes the victim of sound, a hostage of the sonorization of the visible
and then, human society had only ever done him harm
favourite was the result
what a star you are, o youth!
a little old priest like me, getting along mumbling poppycock?
did you oil the door hinges so they won’t make a noise?
he ate up a fairly large allowance, something like three thousand francs, doing nothing
all the same, said jondrette, no harm going round to check
and then, without moving a muscle, without shifting her head, she looked all around her with her eyes wide open and an air of joy and she said nothing more
to say the clever is the same as saying the mediocre
he had the same unflappable preoccupied look
the very instant he found himself untied, while javert was busy making out his report, he had taken advantage of the confusion, the clamour, the crowd, the darkness, and of a moment when attention was not fixed on him, to leap out the window
a convict was his benefactor!
he gave the old chief tenant three francs a month to come and sweep out the rathole and bring him, every morning, a small supply of hot water, a fresh egg, and a little bread roll worth one sou
you hear the bell
that was the last time
some little time later it happened that the seine-et-oisenumber prefecture sent the prefecture of police in paris a notice about the kidnapping of a child, which had taken place, they said, in peculiar circumstances, in the commune of montfermeil
he only had three shirts, one on his back, one in his chest of drawers, and the third at the laundry
indeed, what was the good of having a nice face and a delectable outfit if you don’t show them off?
both of them, one in number, the other in number, made sizeable donations to mother catherine de bar, a benedictine nun called of the blessed sacrament, to found a convent of the order of saint benedict with this pious aim;number initial permission was granted mother catherine de bar by monsieur de metz, abbé of saint-germain, with the stipulation that no maiden can be admitted unless she brings three hundred livres in board which equals six thousand livres in principal
four gossips were jabbering away on a doorstop

the squares were still holding

this coincided with a black cloud that promptly hid the sun
the secondhand dealer she owed money to for her furniture—some furniture!—had said to her: if you try to sneak off, i’ll have you arrested as a thief

there you go, he said
love is life—except when it is death

who was it that was fleeing so desperately?
all he knew about these two characters was that they had been appointed by the king,number one to his bishopric, the other to his living, on the same day, which happened to be april number, number when madame magloire took down the paintings to shake the dust off, the bishop had found this detail written in faded ink on a little square of paper yellow with age, stuck behind the portrait of the abbé of grand-champ with four sealing wafers
is monsieur in a hurry?
in fact, today, i’m just reminded by the weather, louis-philippe could use his royalty at both ends, extend the sceptre end against the people and open up the umbrella end against the skies
never had such a vise had him in its grip
jean valjean’s repeated and dogged attempts to escape are enough to prove how strangely the law worked on the human soul
and the proof of that, señoras, is this: give me the wine cask and i’ll give you the people
she did not go out alone and toussaint, surprised by such an errand, would most certainly have shown the letter to monsieur fauchelevent
you could have kept the secret to yourself
this idea of napoléon’s, scorned by men, had been taken up by god
these morning trips were arranged the night before
he doesn’t eat every day but he goes to a show every night, if he feels like it
courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable local of the quartier latin; he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons
everybody else goes downstairs; you, you’ll rip up your bedsheets, you’ll tie them together, strip by strip, and make a rope, then you’ll go out your window and you’ll hang there by this thread over an abyss, and it will be at night, in a storm, in the rain, in a hurricane, and if the rope is too short, you’ll only have one way left to get down and that will mean dropping
the tenants of that house have latchkeys to get in with at night
he’s at the age when you become girl-crazy!
the whole room was bathed in that mist peculiar to dimly lit places that adds to their horror
under the chemise you could make out mud-caked trousers and boots with his toes sticking out
now they’re killing the dead on me
on this sheet of paper he read this line written in capital letters that very morning by the elder of the thénardier girls: the cops are here
let's hear it from those trying to denounce this drift of genetic expressionism, from the inside:
javert pulled the door open, entered with fantine in tow, and shut the door behind him, to the great disappointment of the gawking horde who stood on tiptoe, craning their necks at the grimy guardroom window in an effort to get an eyeful
his face was the colour of his trousers
he did not succeed
all the works of modern social philosophy must converge toward that end
they get up to all kinds of mad antics
the number made louis-philippe king
fauchelevent had been ready for anything, except that, that a gravedigger could die
he thought he was putting marius on the right track and that the boy was about to give in
the crowd gathered there, at the side of the road, is addressed by an officer with an imperious gesture: when the tsar passes, the thing to do is to remove your hat

indeed, what more could you want?
the multitudes regarded these beds of putrefaction with an almost religious fear as monstrous cradles of death
in the billiard room, ma hucheloup, matelotte, and gibelotte, variously changed by terror, one stupefied, one breathless, the third now actually awake, were tearing up old dishcloths and making lint; three insurgents were helping them, three great strapping lads with long hair, beards, and moustaches, who were going through the cloth with the nimble fingers of laundry supervisors and throwing them into a flutter
and then you’ll spend years in a dungeon, bolted to a wall, groping for a drink from your pitcher, gnawing on a horrible loaf of blackness even dogs wouldn’t touch, eating beans the worms would have got to before you
i’m going to dim the candelabra

what a thing it is to swallow an oyster or a revolution the wrong way!
madame thénardier was just smart enough to read that kind of book
the doctor was startled
in daylight, you would have recognized that it was just an ordinary miner’s spike
enjolras went on: who here has the courage?

the man took three steps and went over to the lamp that was on the table
that is the thread by which he hung on to humanity
then he stamped for some little time on the ground in the space bounded by the tree and the stones, as though making sure the ground had not been freshly dug
the accused, for his part, listened to them with the stunned look that, according to the prosecution, was his principal defence
he said in a half whisper: splendid!
those two did not need to be told twice
do you recognize me a little?
he always stuck his hands in his fob pockets
he addressed the public and asked in a tone that was understood by all: is there a doctor in the house?
in this leaden place, there is darkness but there are no more secrets
monsieur leblanc and his daughter had just left their bench, the daughter had taken her father’s arm, and they were making their way together, slowly, to the middle of the walk, where marius was
the elder daughter was scraping the mud off the hem of her mantle, the younger sister went on sobbing; the mother had taken the girl’s head in both hands and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her: now, now, my treasure, it’s nothing, don’t cry, you’ll make your father angry
the paths were lined with stiff little dark shrubs that shot straight up
so, misery, worry, a bit of bread here, a bit of heartache there, it all keeps me going
’cause it’s so tender, it bends under the scythe
a few seconds later, the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything peculiar except that the tenderfoot was too young and looked like a real hick
l’aigle de meaux, as we know, lived rather more with joly than anywhere else
he had just seen, out there in the street, society, represented by a property owner and voter,number physically and verbally abused and vilified by a creature who was beyond the pale, an outcast
great blunders are often made, like great ropes, out of numerous strands
he wore blue trousers, a blue redingote, and a broad-brimmed hat, all of which looked new, a black tie, and a quaker shirt, meaning, dazzlingly white but made of coarse material
while we agree that it was not for some political role that god had created monseigneur bienvenu, we would have understood and admired him if he had protested in the name of right and liberty, if he had put up fierce opposition, perilous and just resistance to napoléon, when napoléon was all-powerful
he took up a lot of space in sixteen-year-old imaginations
thank you, monsieur, answered jean valjean softly
seventh: for a dropped thread, ten sous are held back from a prisoner in the weaving workshop; this is an abuse on the part of the contractor, since the cloth is just as good
he was no longer pale, he was white
the name history’ was given to the anthology of such great examples, worthy of being learned, represented, meditated upon, imitated
you’re driving me mad!
when anyone, soldier, officer, or representative of the people, ventured to cross the lonely roadway, which they did from time to time, a faint but sharp whistling would be heard and the person would fall, wounded or dead; or, if he escaped, a bullet would be seen sinking into some closed shutter, into a gap between rubble stones, into the plaster of some wall
cosette had a minor setback
then these others: conde de rio maïor
pretot, who was also to die in the struggle, seconded mavot and to the question, what is your goal?
what sort of man was he?
now, for an unhappy man in his position, the convent was at once the most dangerous and the safest place to be; the most dangerous, because no man could get into it, so if he were discovered there, it would be in flagrante delicto, and being caught in the act for jean valjean meant just a skip and a jump from the convent to the clink; the safest, because if he managed to get himself accepted and to stay, who would think of looking for him there?
monsieur leblanc had hardly uttered more than a few words, and that without raising his voice; even in his struggle with the six brigands by the window, he had kept profoundly, and strangely, silent
it was no longer merely terror that took hold of her but something even more terrible than terror
he went on, answering the first question she had asked him as though he had just heard it: i was praying to the martyr up above
and, going over to enjolras, he whispered in his ear: don’t worry
thénardier, in shoving jean valjean outside in his stead, gave the police a bit of bait, threw them off his own scent, got himself overlooked in a much bigger haul, rewarded javert for waiting, which always placates a police spy, earned himself thirty francs, and found a means, one he was certainly counting on, of bolting with the aid of this diversion
a doll makes its entrance
he recognized the voice of the old woman, his concierge
grantaire admired, loved, and venerated enjolras
she looked like a virgin on her way to becoming a goddess

who did this anarchic doubter rally to in this phalanx of absolutists?
well, well, so there’s going to be another revolution, is there?
and with that, she smiled

as for the convent, its gratitude to fauchelevent was great
in any case, he was going on a short trip
to blow that man’s brains out myself
when madeleine had popped up in the area, fauchelevent, a former scrivener and peasant who was almost literate, had a business that was going bad
almost at the same moment as the boys, another pair approached the great pond
i’m just passing through
in the process it turns ugly
that old face had none of those unfortunate wrinkles at the top of the forehead that signify meanness or stupidity

in the end, come what may, the gravedigger is waiting, the panthéonnumber for some of us, but we all end up in that big hole in the ground
he gave his final instructions in the downstairs room in a voice that was clipped, but profoundly calm; feuilly listened and answered on everyone’s behalf
and who is this man?
he looked for some time at the english barricades on both roadways, two broad abatis of felled trees, the one on the genappe road above la haie-sainte equipped with two cannons, the only ones in the whole of the english artillery trained on the battlefield, and the one on the nivelles road where the dutch bayonets of chassé’s brigade glinted
wellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to lord bathurstnumber that his army, the army that did battle on june number, number, was a despicable army
he must have been really keen to see a soul carted off by the devil
it’s like a cellar
you can see for yourself, he’s a dashing young man, he is fearless, you can see he’s a thinker, these young artillerymen are extremely well educated; he has a father, a mother, a family, he’s probably in love, he can’t be any more than twenty-five years old; he could be your brother
but even there, he had lost love’s instincts and sudden illuminations
as you can see, he had a strange, idiosyncratic way of looking at things
in which case marius did not stay
he fitted the key into a lock, though the keyhole was barely visible, lost as it was in the darkest shades of the design of the wallpaper on the wall
passersby told him the man and the child he was looking for were heading off toward the woods near gagny
a manly voice was heard to cry out: long live france!
and every box passes through the worker’s hands thirteen times!
if such a hell were to exist, this stretch of the boulevard de l’hôpital could well serve as its approach
while the executioner was burning the great liberating books of the century on the steps of the palais de justice, writers now forgotten were bringing out, with the king’s seal of approval, all kinds of weirdly subversive writings avidly read by the dregsnumber a few of these publications, sponsored by a prince, amazingly, can be found in the bibliothèque secrète
for men of thénardier’s ilk, all dialogue is a battle
(i don’t understand how god, the father of men, can torture his children and his children’s children and hear them crying out without being tortured himself)
fauchelevent headed for the door
was napoléon’s obvious physical decline coupled with a certain inner diminution by that stage?
but i am still a public letter-writer
society’s cannibals, the ugolinos,number are found in this abyss
gavroche lifted it with remarkable vigour and propped it against one of the elephant’s front legs
on the whole, we have to say, waterloo was more of a massacre than a battle
they spoke to him about it, one day, and just for a moment, there was a flash of lightning, like a window suddenly opening on the destiny of these creatures he had loved, then everything shut again; he never heard another word about them again, not ever
how far did the cuirassiers get?
would marius die there of a hemorrhage and himself of starvation?
as you didn’t lie about your name, you won’t lie about your address
javert walked very slowly away
the stars had gone out; heavy clouds filled the horizon all around with their melancholy billowing
this was the precaution a cunning man takes to keep his secret to himself in front of his accomplices
the bishop grabbed his stick, put his overcoat on to hide his cassock, which was getting too threadbare, as we’ve seen, and also because the evening breeze would not be long in rising, and left

he did not try to fold his chasuble in imitation of elijah’s mantle;number he did not throw any ray of light from the future onto the shadowy unfolding of events; he did not seek to condense the glimmer of things into a flame; there was nothing of the prophet or the seer about him
this horde of men, dimly lit by a single candle, filled the lair with shadows
beneath the apparent contradiction lies something great and profound: the french revolution
this represented a sleeping woman and a sleeping child, the child on the woman’s knee, an eagle in a cloud with a crown in its beak, and the woman taking the crown off the child’s head, and without its waking up, too; in the background, napoléon in a blaze of glory was leaning on a fat blue column with a yellow capital adorned with this inscription:
this letter, cropping up in the middle of the obscure episode that had been worrying marius since the night before, was a candle in a cave
and, lowering his carbine, he aimed at the gunner captain who, at that moment, was bent over the breech of the cannon, adjusting and finally setting the aim

at six o’clock in the evening, he went down the rue saint-jacques to dine at rousseau’s,number opposite basset’s, the print dealer at the corner of the rue des mathurins
there’s going to be some strife
he is not perhaps entirely to blame
they danced a little, they laughed a lot; it was a good-natured wedding
and he held out to her the envelope containing the four letters

messieurs, what’s the hurry?
nothing will stop me
follow marius for a while
what’s up, i wonder?
i’ll go and see my auntie
this suitcase used to intrigue cosette because of the smell of embalming that came from it
he must have had beautiful horses?
in great and exalted natures, physical pain brings out the soul, through the revolt of the flesh and the senses against it
it’s every man for himself in times of peril
when we speak of convents, those seats of error, but also of innocence; of befuddlement, but also of good intentions; of ignorance, but also of devotion; of torture, but also of martyrdom, you almost always have to say yes and no

the marly horses,number those whinnying chunks of marble, reared up in a golden cloud
all right, then, it’s the convent of petit-picpus!
that person thinks they’ll climb out again easily, and tells themself that it’s the same thing, after all
how easily, having attained that false aim of life, happiness, we forget the real aim, duty!
we can well imagine
we won’t insist, this is not the place
the young girl was there with monsieur leblanc
on the table there was also a pen, a lead inkwell, and spare paper for eventual police reports and the statements of the night patrols

and, after a pause, he went on: monsieur le maire, you were unjustly severe with me the other day
this service plautusnumber performed, whether he wanted to or not, by making two carthaginian soldiers speak phoenician; this service molière performed by making so many of his characters speak levantinenumber and all sorts of dialects

but there’s nothing for sale, nothing for hire, not for five hundred francs, and not for a thousand, neither
he took two five-franc pieces out of his bag and handed them to the priest
cosette got dressed pretty fast, combed and did her hair, which was a very simple business in those days when women did not puff up their curls and their coils with little cushions and tiny rolls or stick crinolines in their hair
monsieur madeleine said to the doctor: well?
let them get themselves out of it
on penal questions, marius, though he remained a democrat, was still stuck on the side of the ruthless legal system and he had, about those whom the law strikes, all the ideas of the law
these two hearts poured themselves out to each other and into each other, so that at the end of an hour, the young man had the soul of the young girl and the young girl had the soul of the young man
the facts, however, are not so easily thrown off, and they persist
was he, lastly, really the man thénardier thought he recognized?
the moment they were least expecting it, the captain launched his men against the barricade
though, if the bishop had one of his priests to dinner, madame magloire took advantage of the occasion to serve monseigneur some wonderful fish from the lake or some fine game from the mountains
enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms he had had put aside
madame, the baker was shut
so what you’re saying is, she went on sharply, you don’t know her, but you’d like to know her
what she felt at that moment was something like what she would have felt if someone had suddenly said to her: little girl, you are the queen of france
these doctrines, these theories, these forms of resistance, the unexpected necessity for the statesman to consult the philosopher, blurry half-glimpsed evidence, the need to create new policy in accord with the old world without causing too much discord with the revolutionary ideal, a situation in which lafayette had to be used to defend polignac,number the hint of progress transparent in the riot, in the chambers, and on the street, rivalries to balance all around him, his faith in the revolution, maybe some indefinable sense of resignation deriving from vague acceptance of a definitive and superior right, his desire to remain true to his race, his sense of family, his sincere respect for the people, his own honesty—all these preoccupied louis-philippe almost painfully at times, and as strong and courageous as he was, overwhelmed him with the difficulty of being king
they had crossed the river and left mont-saint-éloy behind them
instead of flowers among the branches and dew on the flowers, you could see the long silver ribbons of slugs on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in every case, whatever the aspect, whatever the season, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this little enclosure breathed melancholy, contemplation, solitude, freedom, the absence of man, the presence of god; and the old rusty gate looked as if it were saying: this garden is mine

it is beset by negation
he woke up, stammering: is it over, jondrette?

jean valjean sometimes said to her, smiling with happiness at being pestered: go home, for heaven’s sake!
he went on the prowl in the deserted no-man’s-land beyond la salpêtrière; that is where the windfalls are; where there is no one, you always find something
this destiny, the true one, begins for man at the first step inside the grave
give me twenty francs
it was her father
as for the cost of episcopal services, redemptions, dispensations, baptisms, sermons, consecrations of churches and chapels, marriages and so on, the bishop took from the rich all the more greedily for giving it all to the poor
the violent jolts of fate have this peculiar feature, which is that, however perfectly controlled or detached we may be, they drag human nature out of the depths of our entrails and force it to reappear on the surface
two old trees stand there; one is dead, the other is wounded in the foot and grows young again every april
at the top of the stairs, he pulled another key from his pocket and opened another door with it
her bodice was never opaque enough, never climbed high enough
suddenly he stopped in his tracks
it also makes sense of the recent innovation not only of a counter culture, opposed to the culture of the bourgeoisie, but also of an art that is frankly counter-nature, peddling as it does a eugenics that has finally triumphed over all prejudice absolutely, in spite of the numberless horrors of the waning century
the english army was sleeping
cosette, who made it a rule to please her father and for whom, in any case, all spectacle was fresh and new, accepted the distraction blithely with the good grace of adolescence and did not pout too disdainfully at this joyful romp known as a fête; so much so that jean valjean could tell himelf he’d carried it off, and that no trace of the hideous sight remained
who knows whether a sort of infernal glimmer might not remain on that angelic brow?
he was, as you will recall, of that antique race of old men who await death perfectly erect, whom age burdens without buckling, and whom even sorrow does not bow
vincent de paulnumber has divinely portrayed the sister of charity in words that vividly paint the combination of a high degree of freedom with a high degree of humility: his sisters were to spend their time nursing the sick in their homes, having no monastery but the homes of the sick, no cell but a hired room, no chapel but the parish church, no cloister but the streets of the city or wards of the hospital, no fence but obedience, no gate but the fear of god, no veil but holy modesty
at midday, he would stop to eat and the midday meal was virtually the same as his breakfast
it had not been carted away

we’ll go to the forest or i’ll burst
what’s the latest on mum?
any rogue could get the better of him and his servant scolded him
this is canonical enslavement in all its self-abnegation
what a shame i’m lame, we’d step up the pace, otherwise
it is enough that it is a potential convent for me to have to take it into account
and he took marius’s head and cradled it with both arms against his breast, and they both wept
a mere half an hour separated him from what was to come
and, words tossed out meandering along the way they do, a minute later, after a detour via jean prouvaire’s poetry, combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgicsnumber to one another, raux to cournand, cournand to delille, pointing out the few passages translated by malfilâtre, particularly the bit on the miracles and wonders surrounding the death of caesar; and, at that word caesar, the conversation swung back to brutus
yet, completely in control of himself as he was, he could not escape a surge of inner turmoil
and yet, a new day was dawning and its soft light was settling over his life and over his soul
he always passed close by the bench where she sat simply because that was his habit
they have to stick to the straight and narrow
give it to me, the man went on
i’ve spent nineteen years in the clink
so wrote the great art dealer, rene gimpel, in his diary of
that particular day, cosette’s glance drove marius wild, marius’s glance made cosette tremble
she had had a very bad night
a formidable maw was now open on the barricade
in voting for the republic, that is what i voted for
monsieur fabantou, he said, i have only those five francs on me, but i’m going to take my daughter home and i’ll return this evening; it’s this evening, isn’t it, that you have to pay?

each dray or, better still, each ladder was harnessed to four horses in tandem
there’s a knack, crick, crack, in no time at all, you’re up and you’re on your own
these four men, four broad-shouldered porters, went and positioned themselves behind the table where the man from the rue des billettes was leaning, without doing anything that might attract his attention
for him, owing money was the beginning of slavery
tell-tale sign of a defect, a handicap, the loss of colour of the rising tide under the efiects of maritime pollution
he rushed downstairs and reached the boulevard just in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the rue du petit-banquier to go back to paris
i’ve got eighty francs
he occupied an old and vast apartment on the first floor, between the street and the gardens, furnished right up to the ceilings with huge gobelin and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes; the subjects on the ceilings and the wainscoting were repeated in miniature on the armchairs
they saw the old man appear in the doorway of the tavern
but the bishop somehow managed
the candles haven’t, though!
marius had learned in montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the hapless innkeeper
the empire faded to a shadow that resembled that of the dying roman world
that we sold so we could eat at night!
god performs his miracles however he sees fit
he resolutely hurdled a wooden fence and found himself in the garden
but the constancy of song will
the insurgents become lepers
france had its eyes on paris; paris had its eyes on the faubourg saint-antoine
the thirty-eight loopholes cut by the english at irregular heights are still there
i land impoverished by the sea
that’s what it is to be young; the young quickly dry their eyes; they find pain pointless and simply don’t put up with it
ecstasies in which they forget to kiss
to marius’s mind, if he accepted this offer, his position would be both better and worse at once; he would gain material well-being and lose his dignity; it was complete and beautiful adversity turned into ugly and absurd inconvenience, something similar to a blind man’s gaining sight in one eye
finally he raised his head trying to look merely satisfied but looking perfectly triumphant
as for the man, he really was so tired that he did not even enjoy the nice white sheets
everything’s going to rack and ruin; the world is a pain in the neck
this vile sand that you trample beneath your feet, throw it into the furnace, and if it melts there and boils, it will become sparkling crystal
just as well he left it for me, though, the old bastard!
wellington is just a hero like any other
marius noticed on that occasion that monsieur fauchelevent spoke well and even with a certain linguistic flair
on the back, the colonel had added:
so no matter what he does, venerate whoever bears the sign of starry eyes
what did he do during this part of the trip?
they were a sad bunch, enveloped by a poverty that was slowly squeezing them dry
they left their home county
one thing was striking and gave him pause for profound thought, like a warning whispered by providence itself: the walls scaled, fences hurdled, luck tried to the death, the long hard climb uphill, all these same efforts he had made to get out of the other place of atonement, he had made to get into this one here
the odd thing was that she looked both poorer and prettier; two steps you would not have thought possible for her to take
and with a sovereign movement, the frail young man of twenty pushed the stocky and robust picklock onto his knees in the mud, bending him like a reed
when these poor beings have grown into men, the millstone of the social order almost always catches up with them and grinds them to a pulp, but while they are still children, they escape, being little
and she slumped in a heap as though she were dying herself
they’re a pack of wolves!
the documentary will only attain its human factuality by imitating fiction, even beyond its logic
jean valjean seemed to have one last hesitation and, tonelessly, almost breathlessly, he stammered out rather than spoke these words: now that you know, do you think, monsieur, you who are the master, that i should not see cosette anymore?
doesn’t she have a little girl she’s keen to see?
a clash of principles is like a shock in the elements
a good thing, father fauvent
they’d chase away the graces for flashing too much bosom
marius waited in vain all day
he stages a coup d’état, because there is a break in the connection between the present and the future and because, even being god, he can’t make the two ends meet
she squeezed gueulemer’s big rough fingers with her weak bony little skeleton’s hand and went on: you know very well i’m no fool
to lose themselves is what they live for
you light your candles for me
you, thénardier said to her, stay out of it
they would not stop to speak but would just nod to each other sadly
if you want to get an idea of all the gigantic proportions that come together to make up a ship of the line, you only have to duck under one of the covered slipways, six stories high, of the ports of brest or toulon
with an industry, the manufacture of black glass beads, he made the fortune of a whole town
the ballots were collected in caps
she had all the doors and windows carefully shut everywhere, got toussaint to go over the entire house from cellar to attic, shut herself up in her room, shot the bolts, looked under her bed, got into bed, and slept badly
in the lower rooms they read subversive pamphlets
jean valjean was poised this moment at the most perilous of such crossroads
the four couples conscientiously got through all the folies champêtresnumber then possible in the country
it is not a matter of any equality in rank’ in the eyes of the camera
we are at the pinnacle, so let’s have a higher philosophy
her fate was beginning to intoxicate her
the bed had not been slept in and on the bed were laid out, trustingly, the coat and the black ribbon
well then, cried the old man impetuously with a pain that was poignant and full of anger, what do you want with me?
the good lord is more than just, my brother said
he knew that madame la baronne pontmercy was cosette
my poor boy, you’re going the wrong way, laziness is giving you bad advice; the toughest of all work is theft
boulatruelle had let the individual pass and it didn’t occur to him to approach him, because he told himself the other bloke was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and would probably whack him when he saw who he was and figured out that he’d been recognized
in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge, jean valjean let go of all that had been troubling him for some time
their job had been to go at night and collect from the scaffold the heads and bodies of those guillotined during the day; they then carried off these streaming trunks on their backs and their red convict smocks had a permanent crust of blood at the back of the neck, wet at night, dry in the morning
monseigneur bienvenu was no genius
as for the six hundred thousand francs, you haven’t mentioned them to me but i know what you’re thinking—it’s a trust

the next day, the toulon paper ran these few lines:

this silhouette had something unspeakably mean and disturbing about it, the whole look was of what was then known as a fop; the hat was stylish, the redingote was black, well cut, probably of good fabric, and cinched at the waist
they don’t have much money and yet they’re bringing up a poor kid someone dumped on their doorstep!
we are not saying this is what happened, of course
i see your cabriolet going by from my window
remember what the name meant to him!
chenildieu burst out laughing
for them it is like a hangover from number imaginations once fired, they say, do not calm down in a day
the good women who passed by took him for beelzebub, then they recognized boulatruelle and were scarcely more reassured
what’s more, he maintained a superior skepticism about all things, a great strength in the eyes of the weak
all he had to protect himself from bullets was the bulging half-columns that divide the shops; he remained pinned in this delicate situation for close to half an hour
it is the people’s very substance that is being carried away, here drop by drop, there in gushing torrents, by the miserable vomiting of our sewers into the rivers and the copious vomiting of our rivers into the ocean
the sixth man, who had not yet opened his mouth, began to inspect the gate just as éponine had done an hour earlier, gripping each of the bars in turn and jiggling them carefully
he went on: pardon me, what were you saying, monsieur fabantou?
the congregation thought a lot of him
the concierge began to scratch away at the grass that was growing in what she called her pavement with a knife, and while tearing out the grass, she mumbled: that’s a shame
you’re to get a charcoal fire going in the stove
i exist, murmurs that someone known as everyman
he took a shortcut to the seine, reached the quai des ormes, followed the quai, passed la grève and stopped, at some distance from the place du châtelet guardhouse, at the corner of the pont notre-dame
he reread the four lines, but he did not believe it
i don’t know you, either, answered laigle
before you grab a stick with thorns, you put gloves on
he saw his old general joubert fall at novi just as he raised his sword and cried forward!
this time, it’s me
marius had just emerged from his
the poor unfortunate wretch who aspires to deliverance finds the means, sometimes without any tools beyond a pocketknife or an old razor blade, to saw a sou into two thin sections, two discs, to then hollow out these two sections without touching the imprint of the mint, and to cut a screw thread along the edge of the sou in such a way that the sections screw back together again
the debris that had fallen off the back of the elephant onto its belly had filled up the concave space so that you could walk around as though on a floor
one of them cried: let’s exterminate them to the last man and die on the point of our bayonets!
down in what they call the room of the dead
you won’t find one!
what do you want the government to do with little wastrels who’ve got nothing better to do than think of ways to upset everyone, just when things were starting to quiet down a bit again after all the troubles we’ve had
he dived back into the darkness as though boring through it, with the rigid speed of a projectile; the little rue de l’homme-armé became silent and solitary once more; in the blink of an eye, that strange child, who had both shadow and dream in him, had sunk into the mist of those rows of black houses and been lost there like smoke in the dark; and you might well think he’d blown away and vanished if, a few minutes after he disappeared, a resounding noise of breaking glass and the splendid crash of a streetlamp shattering onto the pavement had not brusquely woken up the indignant bourgeois once more
they dived under the trees in the boulevard behind him and were a dim white smudge in the darkness for a few seconds before vanishing altogether
marius continued to be careless
he told himself that javert and his spies might not have gone, that they had doubtless left people in the street to keep watch, that if this man found him in the garden, he would cry thief and hand him over
and he set off again
like looking for a needle in a lousy haystack!
they reclaimed the light wearing the mask of night
a quick and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, whether poor or rich, for wealth does not protect you from making a bad choice; misalliances are made very high up the ladder; the true misalliance is that of souls; and, just as more than one unknown young man, without name, without birth, without fortune, is a marble capital that supports a temple of grand feelings and grand ideas, so some other man of the world, self-satisfied and opulent, with polished boots and polished words, if you look, not at the outside, but at the inside, that is, at what is reserved for women, is nothing more than a crummy little dive dimly haunted by violent, sordid, and debauched passions—the cabaret sign-post
javert’s whole person screamed spy—and an underhand spy at that
rise up, by all means, but only to grow
revolutions have tremendous arms and lucky hands; they hit hard and choose their targets well
faced with someone whose eyes see nothing, think carefully and be afraid
another time, marius happened to be going down the rue jean-jacques rousseau between enjolras and courfeyrac
if you squeezed their noses, milk would come running out!
we know the rest
this is what was happening in monsieur madeleine’s bedroom
the day after that, he did not leave his bed
the aunt examined the note, turned it over and around, then put it back in the locket
and that was when he put snow on me
she had only one child with her by then, a little boy, the baby of the bunch
they could see his back, and the stream of blood gushing from a hole in the middle of it
the strange thing was that he thought he recognized monsieur leblanc
and, if it was heresy to pray outside the sacred texts, then saint teresa and saint jeromenumber were heretics
at the barricade in the rue greneta, a man appeared on horseback and handed something that looked to be a roll of silver to the man who seemed to be in charge of the barricade
this was where marius had come the first time he had absented himself from paris
the new respite that the assailants were allowing the barricade had indeed been extended
why can’t my wife have the wit to give me a child like that!
the facit indignatio—anger writes poetry—replaces the gracchinumber
but what the drama would gain, the truth would lose
it just happens, like that
do you hear anyone else say: i’ll eat tomorrow!
he was dreaming of her
you attain the height of esteem if you manage to cut yourself badly, to the bone
the assailants, hurtling into the cabaret, their feet tangled up and tripping over the panels of the door which had been battered in and thrown on the floor, found not one combatant inside
he opened a drawer in his secretaire, pulled out a few banknotes, shoved them in his pocket, closed the secretaire again and rang
the nun’s dead, he said
my brothers, have pity!
how sweet of you to have put that pillow behind my back!
this is an art that has made the corner of the courtyard of the conciergerie in paris, where the prisoner batte-molle escaped twenty years ago, so famous and feared
hurry up and get down, go on, hop it, my little elf, you’re the young one
you mustn’t let yourselves be so stunned by this rather stunning pun
gavroche, busy singing, whistling, humming, charging ahead and banging shop shutters with the butt of his hammerless pistol, paid the man no attention
he looks like he’s following someone
several years went by this way; cosette was growing up
agree, compashionate man, that you have to experience the crullest want and that it is truly painfull, to obtain some releef, to have it attested by the authorities as if we wernt free to suffer and to die of starvashion waiting for someone to releev our missery
you’ve got my place and i’ve got yours
monsieur myriel could be called to the bedside of the sick and dying at any time of the day or night
marius had fallen into a mental hornet’s nest
to get his silence paid for?
the tread of the patrol was becoming more and more distinct
and the funny thing was—for in this century the revolution has to muscle in everywhere—that this impeccably feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois
the camera has captured these images faithfully
these are beings from the great neutered species; geldings, parasites, nonentities, who have a bit of land, a bit of giddiness, and a bit of wit, who would be hicks in a salon and think themselves gentlemen in a barroom, who talk about my acreage, my woods, my peasants, hiss and boo actresses at the theatre to prove they are men of taste, pick fights with officers of the garrison to show they are men of war, hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, sniff tobacco, play billiards, ogle travellers alighting from the coach, live at the café, dine at the inn, have a dog who gobbles up the bones under the table and a mistress who slaps down dishes on top of it, hang on to their loose change for dear life, go overboard for whatever is in fashion, admire tragedy, despise women, wear out their old boots, ape london via paris and paris via pont-à-mousson, lose their marbles with age, never lift a finger to work, don’t do any good and don’t do much harm, either
cosette was going away
these two candlesticks held two wax candlesnumber and they sat as a rule on the bishop’s mantelpiece
was he buckled so far as to break?
in this mysterious balance sheet that the reflective marius was drawing up for jean valjean, he noted the credit, he noted the debit, and he tried to reach a balance
he thought of the double march that was going on at that moment in the shadows, crime advancing on one side, justice coming from the other
from the political standpoint, there is only one principle: the sovereignty of man over himself
one day jean valjean went downstairs, took three steps into the street, sat down on a curbstone, on that same curbstone where gavroche, on the night of june number, had found him musing; he stayed there for a few minutes, then went back up
she thought of sending for her
she is a caterpillar
inside him, horror and fatigue
hence, for the commander in chief, the necessity of examining the slightest tuft of vegetation and of digging into the slightest contour
good, i hear you say?
the missus has coughing fits
i’m sick of my cake
it is more hypocritical than irreproachable
they are, said enjolras
you will recall marius’s hesitations, palpitations, terrors
what did he say?
for the rest, the place, being kept by two women, was always in a state of exquisite cleanliness from top to bottom
father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine, and monsieur madeleine had become monsieur le maire
the poor woman gazed all around her
when the moment came, as the archbishop was walking past the boarders, mademoiselle bouchard, to the unutterable horror of her companions, broke rank and said: monseigneur, a day off
who the hell is he going to take those flowers to?
and when he was within reach, he grabbed him swiftly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him up
make a note of this extenuating circumstance
that ordinary men saw his life, but the bishop saw his conscience
the cannonballs made holes in the cuirassiers
meanwhile, trust the little ’uns, don’t trust the big ’uns—
hardly was the light extinguished when a weird tremor began shaking the netting the three children were lying under
old man gillenormand smiled
there was a full moon that night
how much will you give me for it?
the immense incomplete exists in nature
she stopped crying from shock
her heart ached, but she made her decision
it was not yet possible to say
the burial takes place at the vaugirard cemetery just before nightfall
he feared he might have said too much, he raked his hair hard with his nails and refrained from saying more than: ah, there it is
such trains of thought and heartache cannot be interrupted
in number, the author of this book held in his own hands the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in number
it did not close; he turned round and saw that a hand was keeping it open
it is spelled faux, fauq, and faoucq
the whole night, she saw that stone as big as a mountain and full of caves
all that day, cosette was in a kind of haze
his hand was shaking
whose is the vile hand that furtively slips into victory’s pocket?
marius had only one more step to take
number what are you doing that to the door for?
what was there this time in the young girl’s gaze?
in those days, a dandy was put together with a big collar, a big cravat, a watch dangling charms, three different coloured waistcoats worn one on top of the other, with the red and blue on the inside, and then an olive-coloured short-waisted jacket with tails and with a double row of silver buttons tightly buttoned right up to the shoulder, and lighter olive trousers, decorated at both seams with ribs of a random, but always odd, number, ranging from one to eleven, that limit never being exceeded
he went easy on women and the poor, feeling that the weight of human society fell on them
in his lair a tiger had a good hoot
even the public were admitted through a sort of quarantine entrance provided on the street
the intermittent reflections from the air vents appeared only at very widely spaced intervals and the light was so wan that daylight was like moonlight; all the rest was mist, miasma, opacity, blackness
answered the elder boy, gazing at gavroche with the expression of a rescued angel
in the period when he was most desperately destitute, he noticed that young girls turned around when he passed and, with a heavy heart, he fled or hid
oh yes i have!
the latent man that existed in each was altogether different
but to be fair, even to selfishness, the state to which that part of the nation that we call the bourgeoisie aspired after the shake-up of number was not inertia, which gets tangled up with indifference and laziness and contains a bit of shame; it was not sleep, which assumes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was a halt
from something javert let slip, it was clear he’d done some secret research, with an inquisitiveness in keeping with the breed and having as much to do with instinct as with any deliberate intention, sniffing out any former traces that father madeleine might have left behind elsewhere
the bible says: go and multiply
he had once been a pruner, after all, and was glad to find himself a gardener again
they stepped into the street
he put them to good use
so you really shouldn’t be surprised at that six hundred thousand francs, monsieur pontmercy
twenty years ago, you could still see at the southeast corner of the place de la bastille, near the dock of the canal dug out of the old moat of the prison-citadel, a bizarre monument that has already been wiped from the memory of parisians yet that deserved to leave a trace there, for it was something that a member of the institut, commander in chief of the army of egypt,number no less, had come up with
there, the archbishop, aga khan of heaven,number locked up and spied on this seraglionumber of souls reserved for god
on the appointed day, he went to the minister’s
he asked out loud, perfectly distraught
jean valjean shuddered with the unconquerable tremor of the wretched victims of fate
under both the empire and the restoration, one after the other, he had enjoyed the two forms of bravery necessary to the two epochs, bravery on the battlefield and bravery at the rostrum
gavroche stuck his head up, amazed by the size of this gros sou; he looked at it in the dark, and the whiteness of the gros sou dazzled him
behind closed doors, he gently poked fun at god
someone whom you do not answer back saw to it
he would come out with all manner of crude, obscene, and filthy remarks with wondrous calm and an unflappable air of elegance
her father was down below on the lawn
aren’t we friends anymore, then?
you’re losing the thread of the speech you were going to make me, monsieur the attorney, that’s irritating
the tragic picture we have begun to paint would not be complete, the reader would not see, in their exact and actual relief, these great moments of society in labour and giving birth to revolution, in which the convulsions are mixed with sheer hard work, if we leave out of the outline sketched here, an incident full of epic and savage horror that occurred almost immediately after gavroche left
marius’s eyelids did not lift; but he breathed through his half-open mouth
meanwhile, she had planted herself in front of marius with a trace of joy visible on her livid face and something that resembled a smile
it seems that all the time he had been there—over an hour—lost in his thoughts, he had vaguely been aware of the fancy goods shop lit up with little lanterns and candles so splendidly that you could see it through the tavern window like an illumination
the message could not have come far
buddha and the dragon, mused monsieur mabeuf sotto voce
aunt gillenormand had got out of bed
he remained speechless, utterly lost for words
marius enjoyed himself enormously
at around two o’clock, almost invariably, you would see his carriage and the royal cavalcade stream past furiously on the boulevard de l’hôpital
how could he condemn the victim and spare the assassin?
the dadaists did the show as a matinee in berlin and the high point of the programme was a race between a typewriter and a sewing machine
cried the astonished director
oh, no, we won’t allow any more trips
it was floating on the water
the chapter has assembled
i’m talking about their cheese dairies, which they call fruitières
they never risk going beyond it
besides, cosette could not quite remember what marius had told her about being away, which was supposed to be only for a day, and what explanation he had given her
i complete the restitution in saying my real name
you think staying silent is simple?
what would be demeaning, then, for the son of colonel pontmercy, in the impending fight?
the generation currently taking its turn on this earth is not obliged to shorten its passage for the generations to come, who are its equals, after all, and will later have their turn
you didn’t know i was an old coward
you know very well, answered thénardier
jondrette did not need to be told twice
to paint a battle, we need those powerful painters whose brushes are dipped in chaos; rembrandt would be better than van der meulennumber van der meulen was accurate at midday but lies at three o’clock
his name is dehaze
she walked over to him and placed a hand on his shoulder
listolier and fameuil were engaged in a discussion about their teachers and were explaining the difference between monsieur delvincourt and monsieur blondeaunumber to fantine
they were no longer eyes; they were the deep window on the soul that replaces gazing eyes in certain long-suffering people; such a look seems oblivious to reality, reflecting past horrors and calamities in a blaze of fierce light
his whole life would have been useless, all his penitence wasted, and there would be only one thing left to say: what is the point?
in a corner next to the opening marius was looking through, hanging on the wall in a black wooden frame, was a coloured engraving at the bottom of which was written in capital letters the dream
and so on and so forth
then again, when two lovers understand each other, it all goes very smoothly; any third party, no matter who, that might disturb their love, is kept completely in the dark by a few precautions that are always the same for all lovers
marius then saw that what he had taken for a shapeless heap was a rope ladder, very well made, with wooden rungs and two large hooks for hanging
maman said she’d take us to get blessed palms on palm sunday
there was no way of opening the gate
in the middle of this vile rumination, the ideas we just mentioned kept stirring around in his brain, coming and going and coming back again, seemingly bearing down on him like a ton of bricks; and then, without knowing why, and with that automatic persistence of reverie, he thought at the same time about a convict named brevet whom he had known in jail, and whose trousers used to be held up by a single brace of knitted cotton
isn’t there in every human soul, wasn’t there in the soul of jean valjean, in particular, an initial spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in the next, that good can bring out, prime, ignite, set on fire and cause to blaze splendidly, and that evil can never entirely extinguish?
he did not know himself anymore, he no longer counted
between the armchairs, in guise of a carpet, an old bedside rug had been spread showing more warp than wool
and with that, he blew out the candle
at the bottom of the garden, an avenue of great poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent at the corner of the rue droit-mur to the house of the little convent at the corner of aumarais lane
i’ve had a gutful of despotism
we have moved on from the days when those terrifying swarms of people erupted in france, when you could hear beneath your feet a muffled and obscure stirring, when molehills mushroomed mysteriously on the surface of society, when the ground cracked open, caves yawned, and you saw the heads of monsters suddenly rear up out of the ground
the kind of magnetic instinct that alerts the eye made monsieur leblanc turn round almost at the same time as marius

and so idleness is a mother
of course it’s all true
to be left-handednumber makes you most enviable
well-heeled bourgeois didn’t think much of being buried in vaugirard; it reeked of poverty
a thousand thoughts flitted through him, but they only strengthened him in his resolve
the sight filled him with jealousy and he had done everything he could to hurt madeleine
he chattered away so sweetly and so unintelligibly you’d have thought he was a bird
everybody who is anybody turns on their wit when the firmament turns on its stars
monsieur madeleine wheeled round and recognized javert
after that, you can do what you like with me
you feel sweetly drunk
it could not go on like this
your majesty, two of them would need to be placed end to end to make up one of your grenadiers
the sight of a sabre or a gun froze him
the servant was an old maid called toussaint, or all saints, whom jean valjean had saved from the hospitalnumber and destitution
tragedy, which sheds its own light, intensified the thin light of day that was in his mind
there are some who don’t have a lot of linen, so they’re waiting on it; if you don’t get their washing done, you lose the business
and then, you have to be careful
when it is the heart that is slipping, you don’t stop on the way down
he was some sort of labourer in a jacket with big pockets and a pick under his arm
how would the shell of the barricade behave under cannon fire?
greuze's inability to represent history in all its majesty will be met with the ability of this or that fascist or soviet painter to serve his cause by concentrating exclusively on the composition of volumes and the distribution of light
man plays a supporting role
don’t forget any of what i’ve told you
the film is called listen to britain
cosette’s mother continued: you see, i can’t take my little girl back home
the dining room was ablaze with cheery brilliance
the girls got up to do as they were told
with a low forehead, broad temples, a mass of crow’s-feet though not yet forty years old, wiry short hair, bushy cheeks, the beard of a wild boar—you can see the man from here
mademoiselle gillenormand kissed him
and, bowing, he said out loud: monsieur tranchelevent—
'this demand encourages the supply of fake documents, sundry reconstructions and conjuring tricks, but surely we could say the same today of art when it comes down to it
i’m off to the barricades
cambronne comes up with the word for waterloo the way rouget de l’isle comes up with the marseillaise,number being visited with inspiration from on high
the old rattletrap’s hitched?
that’s the fault of rousseaunumber
me, i was fifty-three, i was really pushing it
the muck would be almost solid in one place, almost liquid in another
it was still the dead of night
we got to the stage where we were turning out very good glass beads
but it was remarked how the bishop from that point on avoided going near the square where executions took place
the good man entered
i say: to err is to be in love
poor cosette did not say a word
like certain church towers, the salon of madame la baronne de t—— had two cocks
i’ll be going there to testify
paris has a boy and the forest has a bird; the bird is called a sparrow and the boy is called a ragamuffin imp, a street urchin: le gamin
look at the room downstairs
it was deadly serious
you looked, but you did not see anyone; you listened, but you did not hear a footstep or the faintest murmur of a human voice
reverend mother, you can hear the knell much better from here than in the garden
gavroche replied: maybe more than you have
me, i had my little cosette, i was forced to become a bad woman
she’s my old lady, said the child
how the chain on the shackles must have undergone preparatory treatment to be shattered like that with one whack of the hammer
and yet, i give you my most sacred word of honour that, if you go away, i will die
she let out a shriek of delight
he made further inquiries
two undertakers in grey uniforms with black trim were walking to the left and right of the hearse
if this really is the case, the academicism of horror will have triumphed, the profane art of modernity bowing down before the sacred art of conformism, its primacy, a conformism that always spawns ordinary everyday fascism
gavroche dived back into the dark
no tongue could tell all that this word, woman, contained, uttered the way it was by that child
in those paintings, a host of small regular luminous splotches of colour are spread in rows over a dark background, at will, figuring the spiritual tension of an abstract homage to the soldier priest helder camarra, or sketching the teeming favelas of his homeland
i swore i’d go through fire, not water
dear boy, you give me such a headache
a few pages of history
to do your culp you prostrated yourself flat on your face in front of the prioress until she, who was never referred to as anything other than our mother, alerted the culprit, by a little rap on the wood of her stall, that she could get up
all of a sudden, between two shots, they heard the distant sound of the hour striking
it was concluded that he must have had some connection to the venerable bishop
the pigsty he had a bird’s-eye view of at that moment was abject, dirty, fetid, putrid, dark, sordid
nothing else for it!
cosette continued to pluck her daisies attentively; she seemed to be thinking about something, but it must have been something lovely; all of a sudden she turned her head back over her shoulder as delicately and slowly as a swan and shot jean valjean a question: father, what are they, actually, these galleys?
monsieur le maire, allow—
tholomyès went on: quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, mes amis!
he knocks a second time
mother thénardier had one of those radiant flushes that unexpected flashes of talent will spur in a person
fauchelevent repeated: i’m paying!
their tall stature and their enormous fists were no less disturbing than their sinister stealth in the darkness
after getting his breath for a few minutes, he turned round to where the shooting was raging, brought his left hand up to his nose and thrust it forward three times while smacking the back of his head with his right hand; a sovereign gesture in which the parisian gamin has condensed all french irony and which is obviously effective since it has already lasted half a century
i’ll give you a bullet!
it makes you think of a mole crying out: i pity them, with their sun!
trivia fiends, who collect anecdotes the way herbalists collect dried flowers and prick fleeting dates on their memories with a pin, know that in the last century, in paris, around number, there were two public prosecutors at châtelet,number one known as corbeau, the crow, the other, renard, the fox
having been soaked by the rain, they were walking along the paths on the sunny side, the older one leading the little one; they were pale and in rags and they looked like wild birds
it’s enough to make you shudder, i know!
he spoke to him of the highest truths, which are the simplest ones
never joy, always ecstasy
there is a point where digging any deeper means being entombed and where the light is completely extinguished
and yet it is true; gravediggers themselves die
i go off on my own when i feel like it, sometimes i sleep in a ditch
of course, you can make mistakes there, and do make mistakes; but error is venerable there, for it involves so much heroism
i the issue on the surface
all eyes sought monsieur fauchelevent
marius replied rudely, now that he’d begun to notice that this police spy had still not had the courtesy to refer to him as monsieur
we don’t say home, we say digs
and then, you must have cashmeres
the old woman did, in fact, have a kind of wicker cariole in her shed
as he was leaving them, he arranged to meet them that same evening at the same place, and had left them with these words by way of goodbye: i’m going to beat it, in other words, i’m taking off, or, as they say at court, i’ll skedaddle
this has often been the mistake of the bourgeoisie
it was the jondrette girl
the garden was absolutely still, and all you could see of the street was deserted as always
what is there against him?
they worked up the script
now, toussaint, as though predestined to be jean valjean’s servant, was not curious
there was a holy alliancenumber—the belle-alliance that the fatal field of waterloo foretold
the point from which he viewed all things was shifting once more
i must have had a hallucination
sweat trickled down his forehead
he wore a horrible old yellow redingote worth several millions, since the lining was stuffed with banknotes
you lived in death
fancy letting a man like that come into your home!
in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris
i say, dear bishop, why don’t we get right down to it
the man from the funeral parlour went and had a word with the cemetery gatekeeper
you can’t hear a thing down at the bottom of the garden
no doubt the forty-sou piece stolen from the little savoyard
the fact is that, if he had only gone a bit further into the cul-de-sac genrot, he probably would have—and he would have been finished
some ugly tart that’d make you shudder, i’ll warrant!
to see cosette, to forget by her side, was so sweet to him!
after quite a while, not hearing another sound, he turned round without making any noise and, just as he was raising his eyes to the door of his room, he saw a light through the keyhole
he thought no more of the girl now that she was beautiful than he had thought of her when she was ugly
hitched to a cabriolet?
sometimes it is a defect
hougoumont, said the peasant woman
as he spoke, he had bent down to tie up a branch of the rhododendron and he went on: wait, i remember now
she went on: all i have to do is scream, they’ll come running, whoosh!
the pedestrian coming from the rue saint-denis and going into the rue de la chanvrerie saw it gradually shrivel away in front of him as though he had stepped into an elongated funnel
this anguish melded with the horror she felt at being alone in the woods at night
the conventionist, on the other hand, gazed at him with a humble congeniality in which one might have discerned, perhaps, the humility that is appropriate when a person is so close to returning to dust
jean valjean saw the problem
in his heart of hearts, this prodigious captain was the man who, in his report on aboukirnumber to the directoire, had said: this cannonball of ours killed six men
why are they like this?
his reply was sharp and angry: as you can see, my good woman, i’m trying to sleep
he could well infect you by contagion with incurable poverty, numbing of the joints used for climbing the ladder, and, in short, a tad more renunciation than you’d like
but this is where the question returned: uphill or downhill?
he had learned german and english; thanks to courfeyrac, who had put him in touch with his friend the bookseller, marius played, in the literary section of the bookshop, the modest role of hack
it was the end of the dictatorship
the middle ages aside, asia aside, the historic and political question left open, from a purely philosophical point of view, beyond the requirements of some militant polemics, on the condition that the monastery be absolutely voluntary and shut in only consenting adults, i will always look upon the cloistered community with a certain attentive and, in some respects, deferential gravity
woman has been left out
in an instant, a fiacre was at the door
as they do the monumental spaces of the mediter- ranean?
all at once the idea that the stone had not come and sat on the bench on its own, that someone had put it there, came to her and frightened her
the wall above which he could see the linden tree and the ivy obviously enclosed a garden where he could at least take cover, even though there were still no leaves on the trees, and spend the rest of the night
because i thought as you did
then again, she felt safe, since she was with him
i believe the lark truly is your daughter, and it seems only natural that you should hold on to her
yes, for anyone other than jean valjean
not counting the ravishing chimes that it scattered into the air all the time without anyone knowing why
the glance has been so abused in love stories that we have ended up discounting it
net result: i’m riled
the officer went on: look in my pockets
as he had guessed, there was a building there and its roof sloped steeply downward from the top of the wooden cladding to just above the ground, on a fairly gentle inclined plane, just touching the linden tree
the sweet month of april to gorgeous may
then, still caught up in her ballad, she sang through clenched teeth:
will monsieur have supper?
these bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, this ignorance, this abjectness, this darkness, can be put to work in the conquest of the ideal
the reel on which the rope was wound was housed beneath the lantern in a little iron box
for six weeks he had lived, as we said, outside life; those words—going away!—brought him down to earth with a thud
man is the eel
all four girls were deliriously pretty
supposing that some living being had been so fabulously thin as to even be able to think about getting in or out through the square hole, the grate would have prevented them from doing so
while this was going on the man didn’t pay much attention
he performed a whole host of good deeds as secretly as other people conceal bad deeds
as for other duties, the bishop found them listed and prescribed in other places; those of sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans; those of magistrates, wives, mothers, and young men by saint peter; those of husbands, children, and servants in the epistle to the ephesians; those of the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews; and those of virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
you don’t let go of a mystery once you’ve got hold of one
a few feats of arms were serious; the taking of the trocadero, for example, was a fine military campaign; but on the whole, we repeat, the trumpets of this war produced a tinny sound, the ensemble was suspect, and history backs france in her difficulty in accepting this false triumph
the priest was, so they said, a worthy and respectable gent, one who gave good advice
the garden ran alongside a lonely unpaved laneway that was bordered with bushes for want of houses; a hedge separated the garden from the lane
these fifty men were expecting sixty thousand
i certainly am, monsieur
the abbé grégoire,number ex-bishop, ex-conventionist, ex-senator, acquired the status of the infamous grégoire in royalist polemics
it seems likely that this vanishing of the hell behind us is part and parcel of arriving in paradise
why won’t anyone give me a musket?
in spring, the light shines in sad souls just as it shines in caves at midday
it appears he took a bath in the seine without being aware of doing so
the statistics show that the mortality rate among abandoned infants is fifty-five percent
the second was straight, firm, slight
reproaches made tonelessly by a dying man to a corpse
snorted thénardier, pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand francs
it was indeed that poor girl
nothing more in the street, nothing more in the garden
where are they going?
you’re the one who should go, replied the man
he did not understand any of this and believed himself to have been short-changed—let’s not mince words, robbed
all his blood rushed to his heart
you’re little, said enjolras
sometimes the old man would add: good god!
the storm of battle still lingers in this courtyard; the horror is visible there, the reversal of the fray has turned to stone; it lives, it dies, it was yesterday
they entrusted him to god
had married, in our happy couple,
at the site of these writings your generous soul will be moved by a feeling of markt benevolence, for true philosophers always experience lively emotions
for instance, what i could do is come in the evening, when night is about to fall
he bent down and picked it up
two fauchelevent brothers had been gardeners at the petit-picpus convent
the caribbeansnumber leave nothing but the bones, the dancers leave nothing but the shells
i i despite magritte and a handful of others, commercial imagery - verbal art, visual art - would wreak the havoc we are all too familiar with yet which has for some reason provoked less of an outcry than that wreaked by 'socialist realism', the official art of the defunct soviet union  the comic strip
dying a holy death is now forbidden
good arrangement for one, good investment for the other
the shock stopped both the cart and the orator in their tracks
was he concentric to the felony and repression?
he did not hesitate
it knows nothing about what is rich, it knows nothing about what is noble
and while her mouth thanked mother thénardier, her whole little heart thanked the traveller
somebody had carried him from les halles quartier to the champs-élysées
show me where you are going
so, i’ve taken my secret and i’ve brought it to you
where’s he got to?
the certainty of at last holding jean valjean in his hands, captive, sent all that he had in his soul rushing over his physiognomy
it seems the thread he thought he held had snapped
a tiger attacking a wild ass, a spider attacking a fly
he was benevolent, brusque, charitable, and if he had been rich, he would have tended to the lavish
you can tell us all about it by letter
it represented one tiny moment grappling with centuries of monarchy on the one hand and, on the other, eternal right
no thinker worth his salt would dare claim that the scent of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations
all around the tulip beds the bees whirled, sparks from the flame-flowers
javert poked his head over and looked
the first thing to go was craftsmanship, a victim of ind ustrial manufacturing from the eighteenth century onwards
marius engaged in sad conjecture; he did not dare keep watch over the porte cochère during the day
there, they pronounce jean as chan, so he’s known as chan mathieu
now let’s cover his corpse and let every one of us defend this old man dead the way he would defend his father alive, and let his presence in our midst make the barricade unassailable!
mademoiselle baptistine told what happened at the bishop’s place that night so many times afterwards that there are still people living who remember it down to the last detail
the hive of joy opened and each one of them brought their honey
the gamin came running at the sound of marius’s voice, with his face full of joy and devotion
scotland has its trios of witches,number but paris has its quartets of gossips; and the thou shalt be king hereafter, hurled at macbeth on the heath at armuyr, would be just as ominous hurled at bonaparte in baudoyer square
there are beings who, to find the answer to such teasing riddles, about which, furthermore, they don’t actually give a fig, spend more money, devote more time, go to much more trouble than ten good deeds would require; and do so gratuitously, just for the hell of it, without being rewarded for their curiosity except by curiosity itself
hercules yourselves, are you?
marius’s erstwhile sense of distance from this man, from this fauchelevent–cum–jean valjean, was now mixed with horror
did you sleep badly?
marius pulled his head away from his grandfather and said, softly: but, father, now that i’m doing so well, it seems to me i could be allowed to see her
he saw, a few feet away, at the base of the small roadblock so mercilessly guarded and watched from outside, under a collapsed heap of cobblestones that partly hid it, an iron grate lying down flat, level with the ground
will you come back again, doctor?
what does she expect us to do with her seven francs?
i must leave you
the kid’s profound observation brought montparnasse back to calm and common sense
is there anyone here who’s got the back and the heart for it?
son of a fathernumber to whom history will certainly grant extenuating circumstances, but just as worthy of esteem as that father had been worthy of blame; having every private virtue and several public virtues; mindful of his health, his fortune, his person, his affairs; knowing the cost of a minute and not always the cost of a year; sober, serene, peace-loving, patient, a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his wife and having lackeys in his palace whose job it was to show the conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of regular intimacy that had become useful after the old illegitimate displays of the elder branch of the family; knowing all the languages of europe and, what is rarer still, all the languages of all the interests, and speaking them fluently; admirable representative of the middle class, but outdistancing it and in every way greater than it; having the excellent sense, even while appreciating the blood from which he sprang, to esteem himself for his intrinsic worth, and on the very particular question of his race, declaring himself orléans and not bourbon; very much the first prince of the bloodnumber as long as he had been only a most serene highness, but an honest bourgeois the day he became majesty; diffuse in public, concise at home; a declared, but not proven, miser, and at bottom, one of those economical types who are easily moved to extravagance when the whim or duty takes them; literate yet not too fussed about literature; a gentleman, but not a knight; simple, steady, and strong; adored by his family and by his household; a winning conversationalist; a savvy statesman, cold inside, ruled by the immediate interest, always sailing close to the wind, incapable of rancour or gratitude, pitilessly wearing out his superiority on mediocrities, skilled at proving wrong through parliamentary majorities, those mysterious unanimities that grumble quietly beneath thrones; expansive, sometimes imprudent in his expansiveness, but showing marvellous adroitness in this imprudence; rich in expedients, faces, masks; frightening france with europe and frightening europe with france; incontestably loving his country but preferring his family; prizing domination more than authority and authority more than dignity, a disposition that is disastrous in that, by turning everything toward success, it accepts ruse and does not absolutely repudiate baseness, but profitable in that it preserves politics from violent clashes, the state from fractures, and society from disasters; meticulous, proper, vigilant, attentive, sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself sometimes, and giving himself the lie; daring against austria at ancona, relentless against england in spain, bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard;number singing the marseillaise with conviction; impervious to despondency, to world-weariness, to any yen for the beautiful and the ideal, to reckless generosity, to any utopia, to any chimera, to anger, to vanity, to fear; having every form of personal fearlessness, a general at valmy, a soldier at jemappes;number having had brushes with death by regicide eight times and still smiling; brave as a grenadier, courageous as a thinker; anxious only when faced with the chances of a european uprising, yet unfit for the great political adventures; always ready to risk his life, never his life’s work; disguising his will as influence in order to be obeyed as an intelligent man rather than as king; endowed with powers of observation but not divination; taking little notice of minds but knowing a lot about men, that is, needing to see in order to judge; prompt and penetrating common sense, practical wisdom, ready speech, prodigious memory; delving endlessly into that memory, his sole point of resemblance to caesar, alexander, and napoléon; knowing the facts, the details, the dates, the proper names; ignorant of the tendencies, the passions, the diverse genies of the teeming hordes, the inner aspirations, the hidden and obscure upheavals of souls, in a word, all that might be called the invisible currents of people’s consciences; a bit out of touch with the france below the surface; getting by on finesse; ruling too much and not reigning enough; his own prime minister unto himself; excelling at making the pettiness of daily reality a bulwark against the immensity of ideas; adding to a real creative faculty for civilization, order, and organization some indefinable spirit of procedure and chicanery; founder and lawmaker of a dynasty; having something of charlemagne about him and something of an attorney—all in all, a lofty and original character, a prince who knew how to govern with authority in spite of france’s anxiety and how to hold on to power in spite of europe’s jealousy
with his crimped and pomaded hair, his pinched waist, his womanly hips, and the bust of a prussian officer, surrounded by the murmur of admiration of the girls on the boulevard, his tie suavely knotted, a club in his pocket and a flower in his buttonhole; such was this fop of the house of death
i think i’m not mistaken and that those are the names my brother mentioned
in this deathly valley, at the foot of the slope the cuirassiers had scaled, now flooded by the masses of the english, under the converging fire of the artillery of the victorious enemy, under a frightening rain of projectiles, this square fought on
i have been to the auvergne, i have been to faverolles, sure!
all of it was black
my friends, every new bridegroom should be a prince aldobrandininumber take advantage of this one minute of your life to soar off into the empyrean with the swans and the eagles, even if it means dropping back down into the bourgeois world of frogs the next day
two days of pine cones!
he was like the village idiot in the presence of all these fine minds ranged in battle around him—or like a foreigner in the midst of this society that had him by the throat
if he hadn’t found the bundle of letters by accident, it would have looked like a hoax
you’re not nearly as ugly
thénardier had something stiff in his movements, which reminded you of the barracks when he swore or of the seminary when he made the sign of the cross
he resumed his dark dialogue with himself
i run into you here on the stairs and then i see you visiting a man named father mabeuf who lives over austerlitz way, sometimes, when i’m out walking around there
a grate slid open
she did everything around the place, the beds, the rooms, the washing, the cooking, whatever, she ruled the roost and called all the shots
when he had just got out of that ugly, dark, deforming place we call jail, the bishop had wounded his soul the way a sudden flash of blinding light would have hurt his eyes coming out of the dark
while he was carrying marius in this fashion, jean valjean slipped a hand under his clothes, which were pretty much torn to shreds, and felt his chest to reassure himself that his heart was still beating
and now, monsieur, picture this: i said nothing, i remained monsieur fauchelevent, i took my place among you, i am part of the family, i’m in my room, i come down and have breakfast in the morning in my slippers, in the evening we go off to a show together, the three of us, i accompany madame pontmercy to the tuileries and to the place royale, we are together, you think of me as the same as you; one fine day, i’m here, you’re here, we’re chatting away, we’re laughing, suddenly you hear a voice shout: jean valjean!
you have all kinds of pet names for it: bottom of the soup, crankypants, the mother in the blue yonder (in the sky), the last mouthful, etc, etc
otherwise he did not come up with a sou more than the thirty francs
those of yesterday are ghosts; those of tomorrow are spectral larvae
since number, there had been small halfhearted riots here and there, swiftly put down but breaking out again, a sign of a vast underlying conflagration
how can we fail to see that the mask of modernism has been concealing the most classic academicism: that of an endlessl)' reproduced standardization of opinion, the duplication of 'bad feelings' identically reproducing the duplication of the 'good feelings' of the official art of yore?
nothing could be more touching than to see him handing the patient a cup of herbal tea with his slight senile tremor
i am, with the distinguished consideration that we owe the benefactors of humanity,
they had the effect on him of an apparition seen in a flash of lightning
from that moment, he became more gentle and fraternal than ever toward the little children and the suffering
suddenly the crowd gave a great cry
there in the gloaming, it seemed to be a sort of apparition
utopia today, flesh and blood tomorrow
when he had run into jean valjean so unexpectedly on the bank of the seine, he had felt something like a wolf catching its prey again—but also like a dog that once more finds his master
the opéra danseuses are rose-pink cannibalsnumber they don’t eat men, they bleed them dry
hello, my good man, said jean valjean resolutely, handing him a sou
they conferred on the necessity of seizing the person of monsieur le maire of montreuil-sur-mer
king louis xviii, considering as null and void anything that had been done in the hundred days, recognized neither his standing as officer of the légion d’honneur, nor his rank as colonel, nor his title as baronnumber he, for his part, never missed an opportunity to sign himself colonel baron pontmercy
they were dignified, but they were not august
it’s the end of the world
this red flag kicked up a storm and disappeared into it
after about three hundred feet, he reached a point where the street forked
they say it’s quite a grotto
if she does not see monsieur le maire before then, she went on timidly, she won’t know monsieur le maire is back; it will be easy to make her be patient and when the child arrives she will naturally think monsieur le maire has arrived with the child
he drags it around with him and he yields to it
what was coming to fruition there?
but what does that matter to eternity?
this is one of the ultimate forms of happiness
what are you doing here?
it’s true, he said, the two of you together, that’s all you’re good for
this bizarre espalier with branches of metal and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
it does indeed feel like a sort of horrible animal of the night that has just been dragged out of its cesspool
it was of very fine cambric and they made out at one of the least worn corners a heraldic crown embroidered above these seven letters: lavbesp
the army was mined at the same time as the general population, as was later proved by the belfort, lunéville, and épinal movementsnumber they were counting on the numbernd regiment, on the numberth, on the numberth, on the numberth, on the numberth light
and i did tell him the last door on the right at the end of the hall
he stayed in his backyard, like the dog
it’s taken care of, i tell you
i was once a french soldier, i’m a blasted veteran, i ought to be decorated!
and i, monsieur le maire, don’t know what i am seeing
it was cordoned off from the rue du parc-royal on
this school, whose pseudoprofundity is all on the surface, dissects effects without going back as far as causes, and rails against the tumult of the marketplace from the height of its pseudoscience
when playtime was over and cosette had gone back in, jean valjean would watch the windows of her classroom and at night he would get out of bed to watch the windows of the dormitory where she slept
you don’t go in too hard; you don’t go asking for trouble; no talk of a wedding and monsieur le maire and his sash
even though no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy, no more in circumscribing the cause than in limiting the effect, the contemplator falls into endless raptures at all these breakdowns of forces that end in unity
rain had swollen the river
in the rue boucherat, rue de normandie, and rue de saintonge, there are still a few old residents around who remember a gentleman called monsieur gillenormand and who speak of him favourably
no, it’s not good
he didn’t have any kind of bag, but obviously had big pockets under his greatcoat
he’s wearing black for the bishop of digne, said the drawing rooms; it elevated monsieur madeleine enormously and gave him, suddenly and immediately, a certain standing in the noble world of montreuil-sur-mer
then she continued, raking her bitter flaming ghost’s eyes over the rest of the crooks: what’s it to me if they scrape me off the pavement in the rue plumet tomorrow, hacked to death by my own father—or if they find me in a year’s time in a ditch in saint-cloud or on the île des cygnesnumber in among all the rotten old cork floats and drowned dogs!
a separate path ran around the outer edge of the garden and along the white wall that enclosed it
bullets ricocheted off the cornices of the houses, bored into the barricade, and wounded several men
we chip away as best we can at the mysterious block of marble our lives are made of—in vain; the black vein of destiny always reappears
how gloomy my life has become!
why didn’t the man reappear?
at that instant, he seemed to hear a voice crying out inside him: jean valjean!
there is not a hint of respect for any of this in the contemporary trials: 'when will the nuremburg code be applied to medically assisted procreation
his daughter appeared, then the servants
but what i do know is that there has never been anything but miserable bastards among all those sorts of scum!
get out of there, he’s dead, dead as a doornail
she was also as terrified as a person can be by happiness
and where is the public prosecutor to be tried?
on top of that, he had himself revealed his situation of his own accord
courfeyrac pulled a mattress off his bed, which had two of them, laid it on the floor, and said: there you go
and you know what else?
an enormous battery was hidden by sacks of dirt at the spot that is today known as the waterloo museum
the latter spelling would put paid to the pretensions entertained, last century, by the vicomte de gestasnumber of being a descendant of the unrepentant robber
cosette and jean valjean fell to their knees
nothing of such a fantasy could have any bearing on cosette, who was as pure as a lily
she lifted a bare arm and clung to the damper handle of the stove as though feeling not too steady on her feet
i have a choice
the rule comes first; as for the civil code, we’ll see
this explains war, made by humanity against humanity in spite of humanity

this was a separate building with a garden where all kinds of old nuns of different orders lived together, remnants of cloisters destroyed by the revolution; a gathering of every shade of black, grey, and white, of every possible community and every possible stripe and that we might call, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of harlequin convent

as he read, father mabeuf was looking over the book in hand at his plants, among others a magnificent rhododendron that was one of his consolations; four days of dryness, of sun and wind, without a drop of rain, had just passed; the branches were hanging down, the buds drooping, the leaves dropping, everything needed watering; the rhododendron especially was sad

jean valjean went on: the only thing that worries me is what happens in the cemetery
he had not eaten or slept for thirty-six hours
elsewhere prisoners lay in the open air in the prison yards, piled on top of each other
for him, the idea of life itself could not be separated from the idea of cosette; he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept one without the other and he was unshakably determined to demand of anyone or anything that wanted to force him to live, whoever and whatever they might be—his grandfather, fate, hell—the restitution of his lost eden

we might say, by the way, that success is pretty awful
yes, that’s the way!
the marauders flew off to one corner of the battlefield while they were being shot in another
whoever sees it quakes in their boots with the most mysterious of terrors
and alongside all this—all such contradictions are the lightning play of love—they liked to laugh and with such delightful abandon and such intimacy that they sometimes seemed almost like two boys
the event is always resistance, between what the speech-act seizes and what the earth buries
one evening, marius was talking, in front of cosette and jean valjean, about the whole peculiar episode, of the endless information he had gathered, and the pointlessness of his efforts
a good hour passed in this way

she had all the fears of a convent girl and all the fears of a nun combined
if this bastard doesn’t show up!
she didn’t pose herself any questions about the weirdness of a chimney pot that is afraid of being caught in the act and darts back when you look at its shadow, for the shadow had leaped back when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought she was quite sure of that

if lavaternumber had been able to study the man’s face he would have found in it the vulture mingled with the prosecutor, the bird of prey and the pettifogging shyster bringing the worst out in each and completing each other, the shyster making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the shyster appalling

as though she were looking at him for the first time in her life
i’ll feel the good lord’s blessing when cosette is here
she backed against the gate, faced the six bandits, though they were armed to the teeth and looked like demons in the night light, and in a firm low voice she said: sorry, i don’t want you to
why should it be exaggerated?
there was a moment of silence
enjolras, courfeyrac, and combeferre were among those who took to the rue bassompierre shouting: to the barricades!
but the night really was becoming too much now, the rain was bucketing down so heavily it cleared the streets, the cold was creeping up on them, their clothes were soaked, their shoes had holes in them and were taking on water, the alarming uproar that had just broken out in the prison meant hope was fading, fear was returning

that was the war waged by ambiorix, by artevelde, by marnix, by pelagiusnumber but ambiorix fought against rome, artevelde against france, marnix against spain, pelagius against the moors; all of them against the foreigner
that would be the crowning glory of your ignorance
peace is happiness digesting
you’ll drink water, you’ll eat black bread, you’ll sleep on a plank with irons riveted to your limbs and you’ll feel how cold they are at night against your skin!
monsieur leblanc answered without showing the slightest emotion: i don’t know who you mean
towns, like forests, have their dens where the nastiest and most terrifying creatures they harbour hide
put me to use
not one spark of certainty or truth had shot out even from the most horrifying shock
between the old sewer and the current sewer, there has been a revolution
mass had scarcely begun when an old man appeared and said to marius: monsieur, that is my place
basque just happened to be in the courtyard at the appointed time—as though under orders
monsieur françois de neufchâteau, the praiseworthy keeper of the flame of parmentier’s memory,number did his level best to see that pomme de terre—potato—was pronounced parmentière, but he did not pull it off
one of them told us one day: to see the cobblestones on the street made me shiver from head to toe

paris is the ceiling over the human race
it has had it with those two tenses, which are so good at conjugating their double absence
the murderer turned and saw in front of him the cold white face of enjolras

what am i going on about?
the words he most often uttered were a sensible fellow and naturenumber he did not use the latter in its general sense according to the meaning our age has assigned to it
a vocal mother: why are you crying, my child?
what would be the point?
jean valjean ducked out through the opening, stepped into the street, dashed through the hail of bullets, raced to the mattress, grabbed it, loaded it onto his back, and returned to the barricade
what was jean valjean?
a convent is a contradiction
not going out anymore, he had reverted to it and preferred it
elsewhere, close to the seine, and even some distance from the river, at belleville, grande-rue, and the lunière arcade, for instance, you come across quicksand where a man can drop out of sight in a trice
we even called him jean-the-jack, he was so strong
he responded to each discharge with a verse
marius knew that the moment to intervene would arrive in a matter of seconds and he raised his right hand toward the ceiling, in the direction of the hall, ready to let fly with a pistol shot
he didn’t hear a word of what madame magloire had let slip
next to the old man sitting in the wheelchair stood a young boy, the little shepherd
how long were they left like this?
even though it’s night, i can hear barbary organs and the machines in the mills spinning, i don’t know
but those breaths were enough to arouse and excite the whole of the natural world around them
he didn’t know it, of course, but the first positive result for him of this shift was to stop the cocked pistol from going off and to paralyze marius, for whom the urgency disappeared
as though he had a key, everything opened; he could explain to himself what he had hated, he could fathom what he had abhorred; from that moment on, he could see clearly the providential, divine, and human meaning of great things he had been taught to detest and of great men he had been trained to curse
gusts of hot air rose up from the depths of ’number and ’number and floated about
basque and the porter had carried marius into the salon and he was still stretched out motionless on the sofa where they had first laid him
twenty of them pile in a car built for six
at that moment, while he loaded his shovel, the gravedigger bent down and the pocket of his jacket gaped wide open
besides, he had seen for himself that personal assets had their ups and downs, turning, for example, into national propertynumber and being confiscated; he had witnessed the vicissitudes of the tiers consolidé,number the consolidated third policy of number, and he did not have much faith in the ledger

an old man known as father fauchelevent had just fallen under his cart when his horse fell
inflamed convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations, warlike instincts held back, exalted young spirits, blindly generous impulses, curiosity, the taste for change, the thirst for the unexpected, the feeling that gives us pleasure reading the bill for a new show and makes us thrill to the whistle of the stagehand at the theatre; vague hatreds, resentments, disappointments, any vanity that feels that fate has failed them; discontentments, hollow dreams, ambitions hedged in by high walls; whoever hopes that collapse will provide a way out; finally, at the very bottom, the peat bog, that mud that catches fire—these are the elements that make up a riot
he saw jean valjean perfectly well, but he took no notice of him
we have already sketched that sad little figure
this is the dead room, said enjolras
i don’t understand how he got out of there alive
never did marius set foot in the house
marius ended up knowing very well this rare, sublime, and gentle man, this rather lamblike lion who had been his father
it was a rather vast dimly lit enclosure, now full of din, now full of silence, where the whole apparatus of a criminal trial unfolded in all its mean and mournful gravity before the multitude
while we were chatting we got cold because of the open window
slang lives off the language
what a sorry man i am!
a few yellow leaves, left over from the previous autumn, merrily chased each other, like gamins playing
oh, i am playing, replied the little girl
people are crushed to death, trampled, others walk over the dead and over the living
we who believe in death are not among those who would reject this mysterious explanation
as for you, i poke my tongue at you
a fact to note is that before reaching the exit gate, the convict, who came from way down the sewer, had to have encountered a dreadful bog where it would seem he could well have left the corpse, but the very next day, the sewer workers working on the quagmire would have found the murdered man and that was not how the murderer wanted it
the driver, a black silhouette on his box, whipped his bony horses
there was something painted on the board that looked like a man piggybacking another man wearing a general’s big gold epaulets with big silver stars; red splotches represented blood; the rest of the tableau was of smoke and probably represented a battle
we could almost leave it there as far as courfeyrac goes and just say, as for the rest: for courfeyrac, see tholomyès
you could feel the truth in this coldness of the grave
surprised but not frightened, the insurgents had rallied
he had to do it!
one of these monsters was going to cart her off into the darkness?
this is about the conflict between the poet and those bores, the railway workers who, laid out by heavy sunday drinking sessions, close off, by their abandon, the vespertine distance’
even in the political stance we have just chided him for and that we are inclined to judge almost severely, we have to say he was tolerant and even-keeled, which is, perhaps, more than can be said for the man addressing you now
other than this, nothing much ever happened to him
even when young she had not been pretty
the wrapping paper was greenish and looked mouldy
to think—that’s the real triumph of the soul
at each shot you could see the slats of the blind quivering
a laughter too cynical to be frank
nothing could be more mournful than to see her frolicking and flitting, so to speak, about the room, like a bird with a broken wing, frightened by daylight
this guffaw was wanting in respect for the group
the sludge was dense enough to hold one man’s weight but evidently could not bear two
javert went on: you said fauchelevent, rue de l’homme-armé?
he was always looking for any opportunity to educate himself and this ripper-upper of posters had gained his esteem
after a silence, he added: go tomorrrow morning
put the city to work manuring the plain and you just can’t fail
it was éponine who, at the champ de mars, had given jean valjean that evocative warning: clear out!
and that very evening, marius was installed at the hôtel de la porte saint-jacques in a room right alongside courfeyrac
at this point in civilization, the exact is an essential element of the marvellous, and artistic emotion is not merely served but completed by the organ of science; dream must be able to add up
separately, marius and jean valjean would have had a chance to get out
in pulling in their rope, they had broken it and a bit had remained tied to the chimney on the roof
she had barely finished this verse when she cried:
they were right, these were jean valjean’s footsteps
he did not reply
the tender and savage tone in which combeferre was singing gave this verse a sort of strange grandeur
napoléon built—the figures are curious—number,number metres; louis xviii, number,number; charles x, number,number; louis-philippe, number,number; the republic of number, number,number; the current regime, number,number; in all, at the present time, number,number metres, or sixty leagues of sewers, form paris’s enormous entrails
he remained pensive for a moment
madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
and also as a result of that pact, charles and emma's unhappiness is the exact flipside of the capacity of any life to be memorable
the age of history, then, is not the age of a kind of painting that is driven by world catastrophe, and by its own movement, towards rarefaction and aphasia
it could be said that death meanders in its throes
for her, getting out of here will be easy
ministerial councils fretted over the issue of whether the vignettes of acrobatics that spiced up franconi’s postersnumber and lured the street rabble should be tolerated
they peered into the dark barricade as you would peer into a lion’s den
he would toss off mediocre verses whenever he had the urge
this old geezer’s put one over on you!
long ago, in the days of history painting, people painted images of the great and their deeds
after all the great periods of art, after the great schools such as the classical and the baroque, after contemporary expressionism, are we not now head- ing for that great transgenic art in which every pharmacy, every laboratory will launch its own 'lifestyles', its own transhuman fashions?
solus cum solo, in loco remoto, non cogitabantur orare pater nosternumber
a moment later, jean valjean approached her and begged her to go and change the thousand-franc note, adding that it was his half-yearly annuity that he had withdrawn the day before

amen, said fauchelevent, who stuck imperturbably to this way of extricating himself whenever he heard latin
when you learn finally to know and when you learn finally to love, you will suffer still
marius paid close attention to the man’s speech
but, as we said, nothing of this was betrayed outwardly
at the time when the action of this book occurred, which is, after all, virtually contemporary, there was not, as there is today, a police officer on every street corner (an advantage there is no time to discuss here); paris was crawling with stray children
one day he had done an errand for monsieur baour-lormian,number one of the forty
the little boy pressed his hand against him, and felt reassured
jean prouvaire was a tad more mellow than combeferre
the light of day seems to go out without, the moral light goes out within; in the these dark shadows, men come up against the weakness of women and children, and bend them brutally to ignominious ends

it is to this feeling that i appeal at such a decisive moment
you’ll find it cut off a quarter of an hour from here
marius had not stopped living at the gorbeau slum
succeed: that’s the whole idea
he doesn’t look like he has a sou to his name, yet money means nothing to him; he pays for lagny and he only goes as far as chelles
a priest was needed to attend the prisoner in his last moments, so they went for the local curé
the man you are looking for is not this man, it is me
nothing is weirder than a barricade gearing up for an assault
they make bread to last six months, they bake it with dried cow dung
and he turned his head away so that she could not see him drying his eyes
come in, he said
how to be silent together, a sweetness even greater than talking;
the little girl sighed as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her chest
there was no one there, which was hardly surprising, given how late it was; but it did not look as though the place had been made for anyone to walk in, not even in the middle of the day
and he remembered that he had dared to feel sorry for himself!
i say every one of them!
the loopholes are only in the south wall; the main attack came from there
i’ll pay, said the mother
less fourteen or fifteen thousand francs perhaps, said jean valjean
as they were leaving, thénardier stuck his head out the half-open door and shouted into the hall: whatever you do, don’t lose that letter!
while he was speaking, he had put his sack and his stick down in a corner, put his passport back in his pocket, and sat down

pale and wan, with his neck bare, his hair wild, his perfectly womanly face, enjolras looked amazingly like the themis of antiquitynumber his flaring nostrils and downcast eyes gave his implacable greek profile that expression of fury and of chastity combined that, in the ancient world’s view, belonged to justice
to resemble the man in the street who pays his taxes, that was the sum total of his ambition
not one cobblestone out of line
a growl was heard, the growl of a big dog baring its teeth, standing in for the english
monsieur madeleine, who laughed scarcely more often than javert did, began to let loose
he escaped impulsively, like a wolf that finds its cage open
that can’t do any harm
which way should he go?
he turned to his wife
the change was a set change in full view of the audience, for a day or two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume as closely as possible resembling ordinary average respectability
the prioress gave another little interior murmur, probably holy, then spoke up
she looked at marius with indifference, as she would have looked at a toddler running around under the sycamores or at the marble vase that was casting a shadow over the bench; and marius for his part continued his promenade thinking of something else
he made gestures and signs that meant no!
we will limit ourselves to pointing those questions out
