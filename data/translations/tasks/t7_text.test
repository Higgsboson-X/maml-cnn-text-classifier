he sat down again and began glancing around in silence; everyone regarded him in perplexity
without saying a word, he turned and headed back in the direction of the haymarket
only then did you calm down; you clutched that junk in your hands day and night; it was impossible to get them away from you
arkady coolly removed his things from the carriage and climbed in next to bazarov
he may eventually become a proper rascal in time, when that nonsense has vanished, but now he’s too eager to live!
i’m talking about justice
one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again
later he recalled that he had started laughing with a nervous, shallow, inaudible, long-lasting laugh, and kept laughing all the while he was crossing the square
everything described here took place almost in a single moment
do you remember how mr razumikhin began letting the cat out of the bag?
we acutely sense in various aspects of his language varying degrees of the presence of the author and of his most recent semantic instantiation
he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase
reprinted by permission of the president and fellows of harvard college
he began, taking from the bundle a rather nice but at the same time very ordinary and inexpensive service cap
i agree that it’s an illness, just like everything else that’s in excess—and it’s essential that it go to excess—but, in the first place, it’s different for everyone, and in the second place, of course, one must maintain moderation, judiciousness, even if it’s base, but what’s to be done?
and he, he—also unseeing and unbelieving—he, too, would hear at once, and he, too, would believe
razumikhin stood there in front of him, dropping his arms, in dark and serious thought
baden-baden, december ,  ( january , )
at that moment, something seemed to pierce his heart; he shuddered and quickly moved away from the window
so, keep this in mind; and now be so kind as to accept, in the interests of your relative, in the first instance, this modest sum from me personally
cried razumikhin with some unusual agitation
svidrigaylov occupied two rather spacious furnished rooms
i will answer point by point
naturally, i considered it an honor to fulfill her request; i tried to pretend to be astounded and embarrassed; in a word, i played my part very well
over here, he replied
you can tell him i insulted all anglomaniacs
katya adored nature, and arkady loved it, although he did not dare admit it; odintseva was fairly indifferent to nature, as was bazarov (viii,  [p ])
she screamed, but the quartermaster, who had lost his balance from the swing, fell clumsily under the table
she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances, so as not to lose her strength
so it is, so it is: i haven’t even removed the loop under my arm!
relates to external cynicism
why have you embraced virtue so wholeheartedly?
and why did lieutenant porokh interrogate me after i fainted?
he also took his cap
i wasn’t that hungry
judging by his voice, he must be very young, raskolnikov reflected suddenly
meanwhile, he still hurried to svidrigaylov’s; did he expect something new from him, a sign or a way out?
suddenly he noticed a cord around her neck; he pulled it, but the cord was strong and didn’t break; besides, it was soaked in blood
he sez, he vil make big satire on me und vil in all ze papers write on me
arkady said in some annoyance
she asked, after waiting a minute
they’re in debt for that apartment; i hear that the landlady just served them notice, but katerina ivanovna says that she herself doesn’t want to stay there a moment longer
this question leads to the following doubt: is not bazarov pretending to himself and to others?
often, sometimes after several days or even weeks of gloomy, morose silence and silent tears, the sick woman became hysterically agitated and suddenly began talking aloud, almost without pausing, about her son, her hopes for him, about his future
how to proceed, ma’am?
¶ court council of war (german)
this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna, or simply lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that very same old woman, alyona ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender, where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test
but why shouldn’t i brag if it’s harmless?
there are no foundations to our society, dostoevsky wrote in his notebook in
oh, i don’t know!
arkady lowered his eyes
what difference does that make?
then he himself hurriedly left the room
as a result of their discomfort, the women sometimes pulled their hands away from the bony grip of his enormous hands
it seemed to raskolnikov that the head clerk had become ruder and more contemptuous of him after his confession, but strange to say—he suddenly felt that no one else’s opinion mattered to him at all, and this change seemed to take place in one single instant
he repeated, thinking in earnest that he had gone mad
all traces have been buried!
i have no sins!
just came to, echoed the stranger again, with a slight smile
they walk with a heavy step, supporting each other; when they approach the railing, they fall on their knees and remain there for a long time, weeping bitterly, gazing attentively at the headstone under which their son lies buried: they exchange a few words, brush the dust off the stone, move a branch of the pine tree, and pray once again; they ca not forsake this place where they seem to feel closer to their son, to their memories of him  can it really be that their prayers and tears are futile?
i’ll take this carriage to yelagin island
she was young and not unattractive—one of the group of women
three silver rubles or two little paper bills,  as that
of course, we’ll have dinner together
do you go often?
if i’d had even a drop of suspicion about you, that’s how i should’ve behaved
you have made me absolutely happy, he said, still smiling broadly
around her long, thin neck, resembling a chicken leg, was draped some sort of flannel rag, and over her shoulders, in spite of the heat, a worn-out, faded fur-trimmed jacket hung loosely
he was lionized by many people, indulged himself, even played the fool, and put on airs; but this too suited him
he’s not sarcastic, not because he lacks wit: it’s just that he has no time for such nonsense
on the contrary, i’m completely well!
the romanticism associated with the image of the youthful revolutionary, and the pedocracy to which it probably gave rise, had something inherently spurious and silly about it
the entrance to their staircase was from the street
by regarding bazarov detachedly as is possible only for a man who is behind the times and not involved in the contemporary movement of ideas; by examining him with the cold, probing gaze which is only engendered by long experience of life, turgenev has justified his hero and valued him at his true worth
everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich, who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg
incidentally, he was remarkably handsome, with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair; he was taller than average, slender, and well built
he too, however, spoke of bazarov as towering over the other characters, and declared that turgenev might claim to be drawn to him by an irresistible attraction, but it would be truer to say that he feared him
and yet i didn’t want to leave it
one of the caretakers asked
zosimov ordered that raskolnikov not be disturbed until he awoke

i’ve come to see you for the last time, raskolnikov continued gloomily, even though this was only his first visit
now what do we do?
here’s what i forgot!
they sat side by side, miserable and dazed, as if they had been cast upon a deserted shore after a storm at sea
luzhin said you were even the cause of a young child’s death
[vasily ivanovich nodded his head]
enlighten me with the latest principles
i would sometimes feel so sorry for him!
to pursue a career other than the one their background would normally indicate
what do you care about this stupid triumph over me?
yes, sir, you had a little attack, sir!
he finally establishes himself in an environment where he can live out the traditional forms of the aristocratic life he so treasures
then you should know that i love you, stupidly, madly  now see what you have extracted
may the kingdom of heaven be hers and—enough, old woman, it’s time to rest!
the lodgers were bawling, each doing his own thing—some were discussing, as best they could, what had just occurred; others were quarreling and cursing; still others struck up a song
whenever he encountered them, he always pressed up against his father and trembled
not officially and not me personally, but we were here, sir
can it be that her whole being is concentrated in her brain?
truth alone matters: what cannot be established by observation and experiment is useless or harmful ballast—'romantic rubbish'—
do you believe that i’d fallen in love to such an extent that had she said to me: cut marfa petrovna’s throat or poison her and marry me—it would’ve been done at once!
they began to buy real cream, do you hear?
never, never did i realize this more clearly than i do now; and more than ever do i fail to understand the nature of my crime!
but somehow he still understood some of them; he looked at him quizzically and didn’t know how it would end
her ample white dress hid her completely beneath its gentle folds; her legs were crossed, and the ends of her feet could hardly be seen
wait, where are you going?
he said, leaning over her
i shall try to avoid that
pray for me sometime, too: and thy servant, rodion
in the scene that describes bazarov's death, turgenev's hero falls into delirium, and is possessed by a vision of dogs; he describes this vision to his father: even now i am not quite sure i am expressing myself clearly
that’s what scared him that day at the police office when he fainted
well, go on, speak
he walked for a long time down the long, narrow corridor without finding anyone; he was about to shout when suddenly, in a dark corner, between an old wardrobe and the door, he discerned some strange object, something that seemed alive
i’m in a hurry, i have no time, and i have to leave soon
these passages—like the whole account of bazarov's death—are startling in their elemental power; they are also puzzling: turgenev uses the hero's delirium to represent his dying, in images that both arrest and confound the reader
dunya exclaimed in horror
an amusing old man and very kind, bazarov added as soon as vasily ivanovich had left
but can such minor matters really be inflated by so sonorous a name?
but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms, since theirs served as the passageway
yes, i hate them, i physically hate them
my regards to rodion romanych
sit down, he said suddenly, but in an altered, soft, and polite voice
who among our writers and scholars has not begun with some bizarre first steps?
but you can’t even write properly; the pen’s slipping out of your hand, observed the head clerk, staring at raskolnikov with curiosity
it flew open with a loud noise  he had not expected it to move so easily; besides, his hands were trembling
can it really be that love, sacred, devoted love is not all-powerful?
mumbled raskolnikov, in a barely audible voice
why do i need a whole procession?
i’ve come to see you for two reasons: first, for some time i’ve heard extremely interesting and favorable reports of you, and i wanted to make your acquaintance; second, i hope that perhaps you won’t refuse to assist me in an undertaking that directly concerns the interests of your sister, avdotya romanovna
arkady moved aside, but continued watching her; he did not take his eyes off her all during the quadrille
do you know what?
you’re being foolish, too, sonya: what do we have to eat now, tell me!
these last words were uttered in the entrance hall
it was aleksey semyonovich; he also works in our office
have you read it?
no, the document didn’t constrain me, svidrigaylov continued pensively
i’ll give you some for the journey
no, not at all, it’s even ridiculous in a certain sense
i was sea-bathing in ventnor, a small town on the isle of wight—it was in august of —when i first thought of fathers and sons, that tale thanks to which i lost—
the antiquated man stood there without moving for a few minutes and then slowly made his way home
i know one thing: there was no preconceived idea, no tendentiousness in me then
but what if he had wanted to or it had been part of his plans?
all of a sudden, razumikhin shuddered
similarly, i must deprive myself of the honor of meeting you tomorrow morning, as a result of unavoidable business at the senate, and so as not to interfere with your intimate reunion with your son, and avdotya romanovna’s reunion with her brother
the old nag stretches out her muzzle, gasps for breath, and dies
well, and the chill that ran down your spine?
she whispered rapidly, energetically, quickly glancing at him with her sparkling eyes and firmly grasping his hand in her own
sit down; stay here, begged svidrigaylov
they looked at each other still more fixedly
sonya took a step back from him in fear, as if from a madman
your father plays the cello?
let's see what species of mammalia this person belongs to, bazarov said to arkady the next day as they both climbed the stairs of the hotel where odintsova was staying
the proverbial words that bazarov omits, which arkady refuses to acknowledge, are demonic: devils lurk in still waters [v tikhom omute, cherty vodiatsia]
if sofiya semyonovna doesn’t return in ten minutes, i’ll send her to see you, if you like, even later today
that’s the simplest solution to the problem!

he promised to call in sometime after ten
hegel maintains that at this level any given phenomenon necessarily implies its opposite: complementary abstractions depend on each other for either of them to lay any claim to validity
good-bye, or, rather, till we meet!
i assure you, you won’t be sorry!
if only she’d tell us where to take her, otherwise
pavel petrovich opened his eyes slowly
but he also recalled that there were moments, hours, and even, perhaps, days full of apathy that overwhelmed him, as if in opposition to his previous fear—apathy resembling the painfully indifferent condition of certain people on the edge of death
during the course of the novel arkady learns to appreciate katya's qualities; although initially dazzled by odintsova, he turns to katya first for consolation when her older sister rebuffs him in favor of bazarov; but later arkady comes to love katya and submit to her mode of temporality
lay me back down
perhaps i’ll come here
she jumped back in fright, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak; she stared at him, her eyes open wide
-; and clark butler, g w f hegel (boston, ), pp
he never takes an interest in what interests other people at any given moment

peter ran off; while he went to fetch the droshky, the two opponents sat on the ground in silence
hey, enough of that, said svidrigaylov, suddenly recovering, i’ve told you
why didn’t you come to work with mitrei the next day?
if you like, with pleasure  i will have to ask nikolai petrovich about
as i have tried to show here, however, the hegelian dialectic has no less relevance for the novel
raskolnikov’s pale face flushed; he seemed to shudder all over; his eyes flashed
¶ a reference to a character in the play the marriage () by nikolai gogol
there were two soup spoons, two bowls, and complete settings: a saltcellar, pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so on, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in quite some time
even afterward, subsequently, when she recalled this moment, she felt strange and full of wonder: why was it that she realized immediately at that time that there was no doubt?
that's the one thing i have changed
by the way, mama, i committed an unforgivable act yesterday; i must have been out of my mind
his serious concerns are positive
seldom has a writer given a better cue to the meaning of his work, and most of all in the comparison between bazarov and pugatchev, the leader of an th century peasant rebellion who was hanged by a tzar
enough of that, arkady repeated after katya
you’re caught at last!
raskolnikov stood still for a long time and watched him go
the lodger opened his eyes, shuddered, and recognized nastasya
frightened, i ran away, and just then i heard the bell announce the train
bazarov would not steal a handkerchief for the same reason that he would not eat a piece of putrid beef
he begged her pitifully
svidrigaylov had arranged for a requiem to be sung punctually twice a day
in the first place, it’s impossible to say it here on the street; secondly, you must also hear what sofiya semyonovna has to say; in the third place, i have some documents to show you
literature has acquired a more mature outlook, and many harmful prejudices have been rooted out and ridiculed

i do not know you well, replied bazarov
he was here, but he’s vanished!

toggenburg and all the minnesingers, that is, it deals with the romantic ideal of love as something transcendent, extraordinary, fatal, mysterious, poetic, and infinitely distant from ordinary life
i’ve told you already, i did, i told you
were you also a cardsharp?
pavel petrovich walked to the end of the garden, also grew thoughtful, and also raised his gaze to the sky
it should be only one of us
what do you care about that?
we’ve gone further in our convictions
is not it true, bazarov, he's a sybarite?
she pointed at someone in the crowd
why do you say that?
for no one is so much the ideologue of the romantic and the aesthetic as pavel
entering the courtyard, she turned right, toward the corner where a staircase led up to her apartment
i have heard that countess lambert is dissatisfied with the novel: do not believe it
fenechka asked, taking the heavily bound volume into her hands
but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance, so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first, as if with annoyance, but then it grew stronger and stronger
turgenev is a master of language; he is interested in words in a way that the other great nineteenth-century russian novelists—with the exception of gogol— are not
at last they began to fear pulkheriya aleksandrovna’s strange silence on several points
they hire unreliable people to change banknotes in offices: can you trust perfect strangers with a job like that?

he added with a laugh
put some money away for a rainy day?
why isn’t zametov there?
the term, with due allowance for the changes of a century and of cultures, points to two fundamental aspects of bazarov that underlie both his attractive and repulsive traits for most readers—his immaturity and his position as an outsider in a world he never made

raskolnikov was silent and stared fixedly and decisively at porfiry
for a long time he tried to grasp one but he couldn’t; he was growing tired of his efforts
in what way does he (or she) differ from that other contemporary reader?
but faith in the people seems just as irrational to bazarov as the rest of the 'romantic rubbish
linked to the defeminization of appearance was the unconscious longing to resemble the man, for the distinctive garb of the nihilist girl—short hair, cigarettes, plain garments—were boyish affectations
this is the same as yesterday, cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna bitterly
he was almost beginning to rave; an anxious smile wandered across his lips
a dirty mutt, trembling from the cold, ran across the road in front of him

it wasn’t so much that he understood, but that he clearly felt, with all the strength of his feeling, that not only with his previous sentimental expansiveness, but even with whatever resources he had available, he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the police office, even if instead of their being just police officers, they were all his own brothers and sisters, even then he would have had no reason to communicate with them, not for anything in his life

with trembling hands, pulkheriya aleksandrovna handed him the letter
you seem to have forgotten my sister is both beautiful and clever, and  you in particular, arkady nikolaevich, should not say such things, especially with such a serious expression
why are you here?
give it to me!
he accused herzen and ogaryov of slavophilism in their thinking about the supposed revolutionary potential of the peasantry
the lament of poor, consumptive, bereaved katerina ivanovna seemed to produce a strong effect on the public

by contrast, turgenev sees communities, large and small, as a threat to an always precarious individuality and sense of identity
he’s a former house serf
and how do i know?
i’m all mixed up; that was then!
if i differ from lowe, it is in seeing this plot not as another endorsement of romantic love, but as quite the opposite
the rude expression of this irony, and a causeless and purposeless harshness in the treatment of others relates to external cynicism
i, too, don’t know how to thank him, continued raskolnikov, suddenly frowning and lowering his head
'what are you complaining about, what are you seeking, what do you ask of life?
it is the lucidity of final self-confrontation, bazarov's lament over his lost, his unused powers: i was needed by russia  no, it's clear, i was not needed  and: i said i should rebel  i rebel, i rebel!
go back to them and stay with them
oh, lord, did he really spend it all on drink?
he was not bored with her, and she offered to repeat yesterday's performance of the sonata; but when at last odintsova returned and he saw her, his heart instantly felt a pang  she was coming through the garden at a somewhat tired pace; her cheeks were red, her eyes shining brighter than usual under her round straw hat
she must have hidden here and not slept the whole night
the second is that of the raznochintsy, literally persons of various classes, a term applied to those members of classes other than the gentry, usually the clergy or the minor and provincial professional and bureaucratic classes, who sought  from ralph e matlaw, turgenev's novels, harvard slavic studies iv ()

bowing politely to his former traveling companion, he cried, let's go!
it's not for nothing i have always said you were the kindest, smartest man in the whole world; now i see you are as reasonable as you are magnanimous
you don’t believe in god!
i found ’em in the street, and he says this with some uncertainty, without looking at me
she rushed to him and embraced him tightly once more
ilya petrovich replied strangely
yet they couldn’t find general kobelev for someone who was looking for him
he looked around at the worn yellowish wallpaper, at the dust, his couch
it doesn’t mean a thing!
her head was spinning
i didn’t say that; but perhaps you’re also right about that; however
katya made a slight curtsey, took up a position next to her sister, and began sorting the flowers
then he listened again for sounds on the staircase, listening attentively, for a long time
in addition, i can recommend ganot, traité élémentaire de physique expérimentale
that is why bazarov is easily excited, why everything vexes him, everything has an effect on him, despite all his firmness and consistency in words and actions
he recalled his late wife  she did not live to see it!
persecution from the government reached a climax in  when the book version appeared
she stood in the same place, three paces away from the table
you are a proponent of the do- mostroi
and it all works out
muttered raskolnikov at last, not even comprehending the question very well
petr petrovich grew angry
who’s that curly-haired fellow who just looked in here?
somewhere down below, in the depths, visible just beneath his feet, he seemed to see all of his recent past, his previous thoughts, previous problems, previous subjects, previous impressions, this entire panorama, even himself, and everything else, everything
he said with utmost clarity, with the most offensive precision, that the reason for all of it was his miserable condition, his poverty and helplessness, his desire to provide for the first steps in his life’s work with the help, at least, of the three thousand rubles he had counted on finding at the old woman’s apartment
gradually she grew used to him, but was still timid in his presence, when suddenly her mother, arina, died from cholera
i’d have replaced the rock and put it back the same way as it was before, pressed it down with my foot, and then gone away
the creation of such figures as bazarov's mother and father is a real triumph of talent

(the force of the juxtaposition is vitiated in translation; in the original, fathers is the last word of stanza  and child is the first word of stanza )
it means that i was bored to death with all of you and want to be alone, raskolnikov replied calmly
he repeated, involuntarily enjoying an awareness of his own maturity and freedom
i’ll be even worse!
painstakingly surrounded by flourishes
he was on the same bed, wrapped up as before in the same blanket; the candle was not lit; full daylight was showing through the window
you ought to consult an experienced doctor, and not that chubby fellow you see!
some clerks were sitting and writing in the second room, dressed only a little bit better than he was, and they were all strange-looking
but his heart didn’t stop

the fact is that the events are not particularly entertaining and that the idea is not startlingly true

they consider raphael a fool because, they say, he's an authority; and they themselves are disgustingly impotent and sterile; their imagination goes no further than girl at the fountain no matter how hard they try!
i thought about that, too
such criticism has long ceased to have any intrinsic value, yet it serves well to define the heavy weight of tradition still bearing down on much of turgenev criticism and scholarship, particularly in the west
replies vehemently to pavel pe-trovich's tirades and does not immediately succeed in gaining control over himself and once more shutting himself up in his derisive coldness
he can say that even though his teeth are still chattering, he-he!
you,  she says, seem bored
for this reason alone rodion was right to drive petr petrovich away earlier!
he shuddered, came to, raised his head, looked out the window, guessed the time, and jumped up, having come to his senses completely, as if someone had torn him away from the sofa
yes, said nikolai petrovich through his teeth
for some reason, raskolnikov didn’t like that at all; he regarded the new paper with hostility, as if regretting that anything had changed
this is your uncle, she repeated, almost whispering
but it was not the trembling of youthful timidity or the sweet fretting over a first declaration of love that overcame him: it was passion struggling within him—powerful and painful—

he’s a practical man, hardworking, honest, and capable of loving deeply
look, look: they must be very hungry, the poor fellows!
she was twisting the thin stem of a wildflower in her fingers, her light shawl had slipped down to her elbows, and the broad gray ribbons of her hat were clinging to her chest

what are you talking about?
perhaps he’d even come like that on purpose, to show that he wasn’t afraid of anyone

when mama was coming up the stairs, she even crossed herself out of fear
but no one can keep the upper hand with her for very long, katya added in a low voice
but the left was not unanimous
meanwhile, at the stroke of midnight, svidrigaylov crossed the tuchkov bridge in the direction of the petersburg side

arkady noticed all this, but kept his opinions to himself
nikolai petrovich exclaimed in despair more than once
they told me so

according to his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward, depending on the individual; then they pass away, as does any illness
aren’t you washing away half your crime by going to accept your suffering?
saying this, she hastened to throw on her cape and put on her hat while dunechka also got dressed
my young artist would have said to his contemporaries of his work: this, my friends, is what a fully developed man must be like!

my brother's a man of the old school, hot-tempered and stubborn  thank god it ended the way it did
marmeladov, who didn’t pay any attention to these people, continued his story
he was a very young man, about twenty-two, with a dark complexion and a lively countenance, seemingly older than his years, dressed fashionably like a dandy, his hair parted to the back of his head, well combed and well greased, with a large number of different rings on his white fingers scrubbed clean with a brush, and wearing gold chains on his vest

i don’t know what!
then it began to pour down rain; dunya, insulted and disgraced, had to make the trip, all eleven miles, with a peasant in an open cart
what would’ve happened to us now, dunya, without those three thousand rubles?
is it progressive or reactionary?
a page or two of condillac that very morning; but his methods were different, more up-to-date
drink some beer, more beer!
my purpose will be to suggest the further point that turgenev may be perceived not only as an artist, but in his artistry, as a certain kind of thinker

let us add in parentheses that to maintain all this is the only way to preserve one’s beauty even in old age

in that sense, really all of us behave almost in a deranged manner, and extremely frequently, with only the slight difference that the sick’ ones are somewhat more deranged than the rest of us, and therefore it’s essential to draw a distinction
for the most part the friends visit together, in the kirsanov family, in the bazarov family, in the provincial capital, in the village of the widow odintsov
(he stood and picked up his hat)
i have forgiven thee once
put him right on the sofa, with his head over here, raskolnikov said
you’ll come here again?

this way, this way, to my place!
i heard it myself
anna sergeevna continued farther down the path, her beautiful dress rustling lightly
razumikhin will be with you; i told him
raskolnikov cried in a frenzy

now i remember, said raskolnikov, after some minutes of sullen reflection

the rain still hadn’t ended

where’s the raising of lazarus?† find it for me, sonya
may , completely gray, stout, and somewhat stooped; he's waiting for his son, who just received his candidate's degree, as he himself had some time before
wer für die besten seiner zeit gelebt— der hat gelebt für alle zeiten
he even wondered whether he might be mistaken
what do you think?
the same set of values forms the background at the bazarovs's: when arkady and evgeny talk on the haystack about ultimate questions, they are interrupted by bazarov's father, who more than anyone (except, perhaps his wife) represents a devotion to home, to family, and to immediate neighbors, especially the peasants, whom he treats as part of his family
i do not understand you

good heavens, save her!

not on your life!
he taught us to read and taught me grammar and religion, she added with dignity
nikolai petrovich seemed much more excited than his son; he seemed to have become a little flustered, grown timid as it were
vasily ivanovich's eyes suddenly opened wide, his cheeks flushed slightly
just stand there in front of her?
what did you say?
no one much liked raskolnikov; everyone shunned him
