the little hand tripped along paying no heed to the numerals as it came up on them, touched and passed them, left them behind, far behind, and returned to come up on them again
he had been sitting there drumming his fingers on the table and twirling his moustache
heliotropic as science says of life-forms
why had they approached him with this proposal just now, prematurely rousing him from sensible resignation, filling him with doubt and indecision?
premièrement l’un et maintenant l’autre
that is not what i wanted to say
david was already no less stultified and alienated from his origins-if not to say, grown no less brutish-than solomon
hans castorp mulled this over as rapidly as possible
they attended an ice-skating contest, a bobsled race—for the winter sport season in our alpine valley was in full swing
kesselmeyer, you’ve eaten at my table…
instead, the more they talked the more confused i got
for although silly enough, they placed what we had heard under a soothing and accepted aspect, the aesthetic, which, however inappropriate,
they simply belonged to the fixed schedule of a normal day, and ended the main rest cure with an apostrophe
he spoke the c of coffee far back in his throat, as if already tasting and swallowing it
how goes it, lad!
the doctor came to look at him
he took the violinist's instrument from him, and having first turned it around in his hands to establish its origin, he improvised quite grandly on it, even inserting, just to make us laugh, a few bars of the cadenza from his violin concerto
i remained in munich for two days to say goodbye here and there and to supplement my gear with some minor items
but we ought to have made a million long before this, he said, his voice edgy with excitement, his hands trembling
and since, as he had noted, hans castorp was looking robust and really quite splendid thanks to his stay at the sanatorium, which had gone on much longer than expected, he assumed that his nephew would be returning home with him now
why, you’re asleep, joachim said
oh no, it won’t turn out all right
if only there had not been something in that sublime exercise of intellect that kept one in a state of constant anxiety
hanno’s gratitude to his teacher was boundless, and he abandoned himself to his guidance
interrogation under torture, what did the gentlemen think of that?
he was in charge of the sanatorium, its highest authority—and hans castorp’s heart felt a restive longing for paternal authority
have you firmly resolved the matter?
and as winter set in and then lost its fury again, thomas buddenbrook’s new house rose above the roomy cellars
i’ve just returned from a situation that is much sadder, let me tell you
the consul felt an irresistible need to go back upstairs and see about the ladies
development had been a small part of the �onata, a modest refuge for subjective illumination and energy
a great many noble and prudent minds have detested tobacco smoke
all i have to do is make a few payments and advances here and there, and patience and respect will be restored
you have already experienced the advantages of such a relationship
and so bourgeois imperialism, accustomed now to victory, could not warn enough against anarchy,
i’ve used it with you all along, and will for all eternity
opiates are the devil’s tool, for they create dullness, rigidity, stagnation, slavish inertia
a k ferge, the simple martyr to whom all higher things were foreign, had held such a ghostly hand in his own hand one evening and had determined by touch that it was well formed and whole, whereupon, by some means he could not quite describe, it had withdrawn itself from his grip, which though hearty had been quite within the bounds of respect
i assure you that the whole mood was shot to hell
i don’t always remember everything that may burst from my lips
publicly, i shall stand quite aloof from the whole affair
i have taken a couple of rooms at the city of hamburg inn … and here i am, antonie, to hear from your own lips that last, decisive word that will make me happier than i can possibly express
the league in which you claim we stand, has itself to do with love, you ninny
i’ve already made it clear to him how he behaved, thomas, she interrupted, sitting up and laying a hand across her breast, more than clear, let me tell you
yes, you shall have your look at the state of my affairs, nothing can escape your eyes
a narrative, then, can set to work and deal with time in much the same way as those depraved dreams
but i ask you, it’s almost eight years now since i’ve seen him—and under the circumstances
the one a piano teacher, the other an active partner in a visceral enterprise, that is to say, in a firm that produced sausage casings
the horses of the funeral coach were shrouded in black, with only their restless eyes visible
the lamps were extinguished, the curtains flew apart, anemic daylight filled the room, and cold foggy air poured in through the wide windows
material, it is the person himself-and so hardly suitable for artistic segmentation
at present he was busy supplementing an english-german dictionary that he considered inadequate
no sooner would she take time to catch her breath than new words were gushing and surging out of her
and are you going to accept?
that’s what people call a passion, i believe
i love my violin and have come rather far with it, but i value the piano more
it was just like a day many years before, when hans castorp had been privileged to hear a world-famous singer, an italian tenor, from whose throat the power of grace-filled art had poured out over the hearts of men
but that could be demonstrated only if a chill was also present—otherwise the skin remained hot
it turned out that they had mistaken a precipitate of gypsum for protoplasm
what about you, christian?
herr gosch was not doing well; with a lovely, sweeping gesture he rebuffed any assumption that he should be counted among life’s fortunate
but the consul returned alone again and walked over to herr grünlich, who was standing at the window staring out into the rain, his hands behind his back
for a slightly tipsy young master of the muffling art with an abnormal skin condition, who was no longer totally lacking in experience when it came to illicit matters, this was a speculation that bore the stamp of logic and truth and, far from being absurd, seemed as perfectly obvious as it was illuminating
partial payment, my foot!
but that only seems to be the case
they quoted herr stengel: you were asked to draw a line, and what have you done?
what have i ever done to him?
yes, it’s almost too beautiful, tony
she was quite aware of her obligations to her family and the firm, was proud of those obligations
well, i later rendered that service to my friend and like to think back to that evening and our first exploratory conversation on the subject
honored friends!—this humble rhyming
settembrini, the italian corrected him with particular verve, accompanied by a facetious bow
hans castorp was angry at the italian, and at himself, too, because it was his own lack of self-control that had provoked the gibe
what folly, what a misconception!
it’s an honor to meet you, herr grünlich
but recently—it must have been, wait a moment—probably eight weeks ago—
he, too, was often confined to bed; the cracked-porcelain sound in his voice rattled more loudly now when he spoke, and as his fever rose, he spoke more—and more caustically and cuttingly than ever
but then, although tony was not present at his farewell visit, herr grünlich left for hamburg
but there’s so little love in you that you never once visited me—not once—when i was lying there in the hospital in hamburg, struck down by rheumatic fever
and i realized that nothing was keeping me there, and that it would be a disgrace to stay
and so when tous-les-deux—the pallid, black-clad mother from mexico—happened to meet the cousins in the corridor, she expressed her gratitude, chiefly by a series of mournfully becoming gestures, and in her clanking french asked for them to receive in person the thanks of her son—de son seul et dernier fils qui allait mourir aussi
what did he have to say about it today?
only one i would not and will not hear, for it is a most certain spiteful slander and befits me not in the least
that clear, fresh voice reaches his spirit wandering along strange, hot paths and leads it back to cooling shade and peace
life could cancel itself by such means, then there could be no possibility of informed life
in a gurgling voice with a serious impediment, he would address hans castorp—as he did all the patients—by his room number and then proceed to rub him down with alcohol
and, to cap it all, at almost the same time that b grünlich went bankrupt, something even worse happened at dahlbeck & co, where jakob worked in hamburg
the old woman asked after a pause
he always was concerned about his body, much more than i, or at least in a different way than i, because i was always the civilian, and more interested in a nice warm bath and good food and drink, when what he wanted were challenges and exploits
and for whom should he have gone to any trouble?
are you going to go, hans?
you may well imagine that many topics of conversation offered themselves as we dined; but no sooner was the soup course ended than we left old anecdotes behind and proceeded to more serious and fascinating subjects
the senate had already proposed the latter
it has a castle and a cathedral, where one is shown the tomb of kaiser otto i i i , adelheid's grandson and theophano's son, who called himself both emperor of the romans and saxonicus, not because he wanted to be a saxon, but in the same sense that scipio took the name africanus-that is, because he had defeated the saxons
it was the theme, the first theme again!
but the tone, which is no more, for which, as it hangs there vibrating in the silence, only the soul still listens, and which was the dying note of sorrow-is no longer that, its meaning changes, it stands as a light in the night
and what are you reading, fräulein buddenbrook, if i might ask?
this was a significant decision, which, as i saw it, was uniquely stamped with destiny and which in some sense both annulled the recent past and reconnected with our common life from long ago, with moments whose memory i bore in my heart: with the time when i had found the lad experimenting on his uncle's harmonium, and, still farther back, with our singing canons with barnyard hanne under the linden tree
and from under his fingers came a swelling, blossoming, interweaving melody, from which arose in elegant counterpoint—at first only sporadic, but then ever more clear and vigorous—a great, old-fashioned, wonderful, and grandiose march, which moved toward a climax, intertwining, modulating, and finally resolving as the violin entered fortissimo
true, i have learned something about life, but that just makes the prospect of sitting around here at home like a silly goose all the more depressing
here one likewise experienced how behind a contemporary f��ade the depths of time are constantly interposing in soft ghostly tones, and not without also confronting the eye with enduring architectural tokens and even picturesquely breaching the present now and again in historical masquerade, in the folk costume of halle, in the garb of ancestral salt-workers
joachim’s feet seemed very large, his legs very thin—and they looked as if they had been wrapped, more for sport than for any military reason
hans castorp sat half propped up in bed, his head tilted to one side and a blurry look of fond devotion in his eyes, and he listened now to the harmonies drifting in through the open balcony door—though not without a mental shrug at the thought of settembrini’s babblings about music being politically suspect
life is not squeamish, and cares not a fig for morality
before she even had time to read the name, a gentleman appeared in the room—wearing a bell-shaped coat and pea-colored trousers
mynheer sat with his jaw slack, his hands palm down on the plaid traveling blanket spread over both his and clavdia’s knees
it was a baroque idea, but one deeply rooted in his nature-composed of arrogance, a recluse's shyness, the old-fashioned german provincialism of kaisersaschern, and an explicit cosmopolitanism
by autumn at the latest, he said, frau salomon would be back again—but then for good
whereas death had scorned christian and would only continue to tease him with fifty little tricks and pranks that would command no one’s respect
the pleural lining is covered by flesh, isolated, inaccessible—for good and all
they won’t obey my will, you see
the tonal space it provides is too limited
the same thing has just happened with you, my good engineer
he is the chief of police…
herr dieckmann, however, did not quite understand what he’d said, and so began to rattle off his menu
i can indeed depend on my good memory; moreover, right after reading the draft i put several things to paper for myself, in particular the passage about apostasy
and he wept … and in the next moment he no longer knew why he wept
nevertheless, he would have been unable to leave his dressing room if he knew he had left something undone or had done it a little too hastily, for fear of forfeiting that sense of freshness, calm, and wholeness—which he would lose in any case within an hour and would then have to patch and cobble as best he could
pastor pringsheim, who had pulled on his wrist-warmers, began to speak again
gerda is at the casino—for a violin concert by tamayo
he now set them on his lap on such occasions, which both parties found just as delightful, even more so
it hasn’t emptied out entirely yet
’mid these halls with laughter chiming,
i did not tell him that it was in fact he who was politicizing things, and that nowadays the word german was in no way synonymous with intellectual purity, but a party slogan
that much is perfectly obvious
and the main thing is that mother will not be upset by my taking such a step—no more today than she would be a year from now
once the dilation of the stomach had been cured without any alleviation of the headaches and severe attacks of nausea, he began to assign more and more of the ailment's symptoms to the brain-bolstered in this view by his patient's desperate need to be kept out of the light
but never wash them first, dear—the blood has to go in, too, mercy sake
this effect is preceded by a kind of bold running start in a dramatic parlando-an obvious reminiscence of the first violin's recitative in the last movement of beethoven's a major quartet-except that the grand phrase there is followed by somethi;g quite different from a festival of melody in which the parody of being carried away becomes passion of such serious intent that one feels somehow embarrassed
i may be forgiven for a more or less randomly directed polemic, but i regard it as barbarism, as inhumanity, to term as soullessness such longings for a soul-the longings of the little mermaid!
but in the darkness into which he fled to escape confusion, he could hear settembrini’s voice droning on in praise of literature
for as she charmed me, so did she work her charm and yielded to me in love-and i was initiate and the promise sealed
world, a far more european space than the political colossus to its north, where the word international has long been spoken as a slur and where gloomy provincialism has fouled the air and turned it musty
we first have to let darkness wash over our eyes to see anything—that’s obvious
deeply worried, i asked myself what efforts, what intellectual tricks, detours, and ironies would be necessary to save art, to reconquer it and achieve a work that as a travesty of innocence could still confess the state of comprehension from which it would be wrested!
the consul stood in front of her—appalled, dazed, close to shock—and said nothing
their inedibility is known throughout the natural world, however, and they are secure-sadly secure
tacked to the wall above it was an arithmetical etching that he had found in some curio shop or other: a so-called magic square, like the one visible in durer's melancolia-along with hour-glass, compass, balance scales, polyhedron, and other symbols
he walked over to the glass door leading to a narrow veranda and gazed out at the soggy front yard for a few minutes
while day after day, in a constant state of silent agitation, i have faithfully attempted to do justice to my biographical task, to give worthy form to intimate and personal matters, i have simply let happen those outside events that are part of the age in which i write
his conduct, to be sure, never dissuaded me from my observation that from the very first day he dearly loved his little nephew, that the boy's arrival had brought a radiant daylight into his life
he is well known for his method of rhythmically modifying a fugue theme in the very first answer, in such a way that, although the thematic is strictly maintained, it can no longer be recognized as a repetition
this incurred the censure of sor alfo, who felt that in so doing the jurist-quest' uomo, he would say on such occasions-was presuming a bit too much
just lazin’ through my day,
finally they left the room to make way for an old woman, a disagreeable creature, who kept rubbing her toothless gums together and had come to help sister leandra wash and dress the body
moreover, not satisfied with just composing a hymn entitled to the fatherland for male chorus, he even wanted to dedicate it to the german kaiser
you were taking your life in your hands—a devil on the right, a devil on the left, how in the hell were you supposed to survive?
yet another guest, the art historian and diirer scholar, professor gilgen holzschuher, made me feel uneasy for similar reasons that i find it hard to justify; and that was doubly true for the poet daniel zur hohe, who was also often in attendance-a gaunt thirtyyear-old clad in clerical black up to his tight collar, with the profile of a bird of prey and a hammering way of speaking that went something like:  indeed, indeed, not bad, no doubt at all, one can well say that!
he did this with a metal whistle whose tone was adjustable by a screw and that could produce a frequency so high that the human ear barely perceived it even at close range, whereas its effect on the quite differently evolved eardrum of a dog was very powerful, even from astonishing distances, and kaschperl would keep still as a mouse whenever the secret tone that no one else could hear pierced the night
but now hans castorp realized to his amazement that the flush that had come to his freshly shaven cheeks had not subsided, or at least the warmth that had come with it was not about to depart—the same hot, dry face that had bothered him yesterday evening, and that had disappeared while he slept, was back now in full force
in any case, those words had spoken of liberated music's never extinguished homesickness for origins still bound to the cult; and beethoven's violent attempts at the fugue had been those of a great dynamic and emotional spirit wrestling with an ingeniously cool compositional form that upon its knees had praised god, the orderer of the cosmos and all its many rounds, yet all the while had been caught up in another world of passionsstrict, highly abstract, ruled by numbers and a chiming relationship with time
but then she continued, as lively as before, but, tom, you really needn’t see it that way
but god gave you both a child, the consul said, deeply touched
it all belongs to the realm of the intellect and has nothing to do with either of you personally, which is the only way something can be an insult
his name would be called out and he would stand up and not know a single line—and there would be a scene, a loud and terrible catastrophe, no matter how good a mood the professor was in
and jurisprudence, the making and executing of laws?
only the briefest, highly compact musical moment is genuine and serious
let me tell you something, he said in conclusion—they had arrived in joachim’s room, and his cousin was getting ready for rest cure
having again consulted only a leipzig street directory, he now sought treatment from a certain dr zimbalist, who resided on one of the commercial streets that converge at market square
there really is some resemblance—i’ve never been in a monastery, but i can imagine it’s much like here
his nose looked like a little flat button between his protruding cheekbones, and his gray eyes squinted and blinked in all directions a little stupidly, although at certain moments they could unexpectedly grow larger and larger, sticking out until they almost popped
it’s certainly prettier than if your name was jack or joe
let me feel, my child
say what you like, there is something pleasant about waking of a morning in a large bedroom with lovely, cheerful wallpaper and finding that the first thing you touch is a heavy satin quilt; and it is exceptional to have an early breakfast in a room opening onto a terrace, with the fresh morning air drifting in from the front garden through an open glass door, and to be served neither coffee, nor tea, but a cup of chocolate—yes, every morning, a cup of birthday chocolate, with a thick moist piece of pound cake
she expatiated on the pleasures of coughing—yes, there was something perfectly delightful and enjoyable about a tickle in the depths of your chest, that got worse and worse until you reached down deep for it, squeezing and pressing to let it have its way
remarkably enough, both our pastor, the reverend rector zwilling and
after a proper period of silence, he replied, my good engineer, i have not the remotest desire to disconcert or offend you in your protestantism
old buddenbrook repeated with a giggle
i’ve always been a great concertgoer, he said
and the closer election day drew near, the clearer it became that he and hermann hagenström had the best chances
and he wasn’t even wearing an overcoat
what do you know, she’s emerged from beyond the caucasus again
his hands, however, were genteel and long-fingered, with beautifully shaped oval and convex nails; and the finished effect was so undeniably that of a gentleman that he could dare to wear his informal street clothes to affairs where evening dress was the rule-and at such receptions, women preferred him just as he was to his rivals in correct black and white, and one would see him surrounded by females whose admiration was undisguised
his father was born on a norwegian ship, and ended up a captain on the same line
we no longer need indulge ourselves in dialectic extravagance for your sake
it was both tender and full at the same time—and cool, one could only presume
but if i use it, then i feel i’ve done my duty and that everything is in order; my conscience is clear, and i feel calm and content, and swallowing is absolutely effortless
timm sat down beaming with pride, and dr mantelsack apparently jotted down satisfactory beside his name
but on foot, how far is it then?
you relieve yourself noticeably—the same thing happens to you that happened to judas iscariot when he fell headlong from the bough—your bowels gush out
he was absent too often because of illness and was totally inattentive because his thoughts would linger over some harmonic relationship or some unraveled marvel in a piece of music that he had heard his mother and herr pfühl play
for long before i dandled with that poisonous moth, my soul, in its conceit and pride, was upon the road to satan, and my datum was fixed that i should strive after him from my youth on, for as you must know, man is made and predestined for bliss or for hell, and i was born for hell
but what i think is that it’s well-nigh—ida still used words like well-nigh—past time for advising, my child
what a shame, joachim said
you’re not really serious, are you?
what do you think, for example, of h c f burmeester & co in hamburg?
as light increased now early in the new year, adrian's health improved visibly, the series of tormenting illnesses that had confined him to his bed now halted abruptly; psychologically he appeared to have overcome the foundering of his life's plans and the shocking damage that had gone with it; his spirit rose anew-he may even have had difficulty remaining cool and collected amid the storm of ideas bombarding him, and the year   became the year that yielded a miracle harvest of finest chamber music
does it make you uneasy?
he could hardly put a glass of grog to his lips of an evening without spilling half of it, his arm trembled so damnably
i think a great deal of you, too
not that he had been unable to cover them; the firm had at once shown what it could do, without any hesitation or embarrassment
fine, the sacrifice of blood and fat, salted and seasoned with sweet odors, that once fed god, giving him his body, is for the psalmist nothing but a 'symbol'  (and i can still hear the indescribable disdain with which dr breisacher spoke that word); one does not slaughter the animal, but-as incredible as it may sound-thanksgiving and humility
but you hold on to something only as long as it is rising in value or at least steady
i think of a coffin as an absolutely lovely piece of furniture, even when it’s empty, and if there’s someone lying in it, it’s really quite sublime in my eyes
i definitely have a fever, there’s no other explanation
everyone burst iqto laughter-even adrian, who let his clenched hands rest on the keys and bent his head down over them
the madness of ascetics
but for the moment he was safe and sound, and all the rest could take its course
one could tell from herr settembrini’s expression that he was still busy pursuing his train of thought even after he fell silent
their names were von zutawski, cieszynski, von rosinski, michael lodygowski, leo von asarapetian, and the like
