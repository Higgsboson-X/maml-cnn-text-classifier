as we go under the portal you can also explain to me the meaning of that painted gardener that you see as you go into the church
in the fifteenth century the seine washed five islands within the walls of paris: the îie louviers, where there were then trees and now only timber; the île-aux-vaches and the îie notre-dame, both deserted, apart from one hovel, both fiefs of the bishop (in the seventeenth century these two islands were made into one, which was then built upon and is now called the îie saint-louis); finally the îie de la cité, the city, with at its tip the cow-ferryman’s islet, since buried beneath the esplanade of the pont-neuf

the greeks tried to quibble about the different kinds of money

his merit, his learning, his position as immediate vassal of the bishop of paris, opened wide for him the gates of the church

we’ve all seen that there are two of you
the streets meanwhile were with every moment becoming darker and lonelier

they did not even try to run away
compère coictier stayed dumb with surprise
the ligurians encamped on the mappalia surrounded his house

the reader may perhaps not have forgotten that part of the court of miracles was enclosed by the ancient town wall, a good number of whose towers were beginning at that time to fall into ruin
jehan bowed low to him, and went back down the cloister stairs whistling
with bronze winnowing fans the temple slaves took up the ashes which had fallen on the edge of the slab; and they threw them in the air, so that the sacrifice should be sprinkled over the town and up to the region of the stars
at length the king looked at him
meanwhile the three damoiselles (for the title dame was at that time reserved for noblewomen) were all talking at once
the creaking of the water wheels bringing water to the top floor of the palaces was no longer audible and in the middle of the terraces camels rested quietly, lying on their bellies as ostriches do

the same law that you apply to truands, the truands apply to you
he sometimes lectured jehan severely and at length on the subject, and this was endured undaunted
occasionally a half-burned bit of wall stood at the side of the road
what have you come here for?
each face, each stone of the venerable monument is a page not only of the history of france, but also of the history of science and art
it’s a miracle,  put in henriette la gaultière
yet that’s simple enough!
the other end contained the chapel where louis xi had had himself sculptured kneeling before the virgin, and to which he had transferred, heedless of the two niches left empty in the row of royal statues, those of charlemagne and st louis, two saints who, he supposed, must enjoy much favour in heaven as kings of france
at that the elders decreed the execution of the captives, although the suffete had written that they should not be put to death
at each wicket, they all had to bow their heads, except the old man, bent with age
then the leaders demanded from all the barbarians an oath of complete obedience
quasimodo then took up the rearguard, and followed the archdeacon walking backwards, squat, snarling, monstrous, bristling, flexing his limbs, licking his boar-like tusks, growling like a wild beast, and sending huge ripples through the crowd with a mere look or gesture
she stuck two skeletal arms out of her cell, and cried out in a voice like a death-rattle: so it’s you, daughter of egypt!
taanach started back with surprise, and in order to know more about it said:
next they thought of gisco
and that wild boar in front of them?
everyone wanted to contribute
even to the ferryman’s!
there were, too, some fine buildings breaking through the petrified waves of this sea of gables
the next two days were spent paying the men from magdala, leptis, hecatompylus; spendius did the rounds of the gauls
a man rushed to the corpse
however, the door stood firm: devil take it!
by the way,  gringoire added, looking at the archdeacon, half mockingly, you still think of her, then?
clemency carries the torch ahead of all the other virtues
they were for all that a people, and he was their sovereign
in the first place, the streets, intersecting and tangled, formed numerous diverting patterns in the mass
and her tone had something both thoughtful and passionate about it
he recalled the violent scene of which he had caught just a glimpse, the gypsy girl struggling with two men, the fact that quasimodo had had a companion, and the grim, haughty face of the archdeacon passed vaguely through his memory
fortunately the street was dark, and the student drunk
just now, while you were speaking, your breath passed over my face, and i was as delighted as a dying man lying drinking at the side of a stream
and when you observe that this form of expression is not only the best for conservation, but also the simplest, the most convenient, the most universally available; when you think that it is not encumbered by baggage and requires the moving of no heavy apparatus; when you compare the way thought, before it can be translated into a building, has to set in motion four or five other arts and tons of gold, a whole mountain of stone, a whole forest of timber, a whole people of workmen; when you compare it with thought becoming a book, needing only a little paper, a little ink, and a pen, how can anyone be surprised if human intelligence has forsaken architecture for printing?
the unexpected sight of novel foods aroused their greed
their ramparts, kept ruined through carthaginian jealousy, were so weak that they would fall down at a push from someone’s shoulder
now, with la esmeralda dead, the sponge was saturated
then behind the numidians, the maurusians, and the gaetulians pressed the yellow men who lived beyond taggir in cedar forests
cut the knaves to pieces!
when he heard the abbot’s men-at-arms crying out their challenges around the crenellated circumvallation of saint-germain, he turned aside, took a path he found between the abbey mill and the leper house of the village, and after a few moments found himself on the edge of the pré-aux-clercs
was it a confession?
god help me, gentlemen!
note that, compère olivier
to the centuries and revolutions, which at least devastated impartially and on the grand scale, has been added the swarm of architects from the schools, licensed, sworn, and accredited, degrading with all the discernment and choice of bad taste, substituting louis xv chicory for gothic lace to the greater glory of the parthenon

their companions, in terror, left the place
the barbarians did not need any encircling ramparts on the side towards africa: that belonged to them

bohemian girl, on such a day as may please our lord the king, at the hour of noon, you will be taken in a tumbril, wearing a shift, barefoot, a rope round your neck, before the great portal of notre-dame, and there you will do public penance with a wax torch of two pounds’ weight in your hand, thence you will be taken to the place de grève, where you will be hanged and strangled on the town gibbet; likewise your goat; and you will pay the official number lions of gold in reparation for the crimes committed and confessed by you of witchcraft, magic, lechery, and murder against the person of monsieur phoebus de châteaupers
right,  said gringoire, i understand that much
just as her eyes closed, when all feeling was drifting away, she thought she felt a fiery touch imprinted on her lips, a kiss more searing than the executioner’s red-hot iron
he turned his right foot round his left leg, stood on tiptoe on his left foot, and stretched out his arm; but just as he touched the dummy, his body, now balanced only on one foot, swayed on the stool which had only three; he tried automatically to steady himself on the dummy, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibrations of the hundreds of bells on the dummy, which, under the impulse from his hand, first turned on its own axis, and then swung majestically between the two posts
then the africans demanded corn, according to the grand council’s undertakings
my plan had frightening aspects which held me back
let’s not disturb her
we are observing silence like so many pythagoreans or fish!
for three days they stuffed themselves
in the middle of the night gusts of wind blew up
i won’t tell you, poor old man that you are, to go and visit the burial chambers of the pyramids, of which ancient herodotus speaks, nor the brick tower of babel, nor the immense white marble sanctuary of the indian temple of eklinga
he had fallen to his knees and gazed longingly at her with blazing eyes
the soldiers were almost the only ones to leave
they had crossed the desert, drinking from brackish wells constructed with camel bones; the zuaeces, covered in ostrich feathers, had come on quadrigas; the garamantes, masked with black veils, sitting well back on their painted mares; others on donkeys, wild asses, zebras, buffaloes; and some dragged along their families and their idols as well as the boat-shaped roofs of their huts
they have pillaged everything!
the same jealousy that a husband feels for his wife’s honour, a son’s appreciation of his father’s love, a good vassal must feel for the glory -of his king, he must drain himself dry in zeal for his house, in the increase of his service
start at once,  the other went on
at the hour appointed spendius found mâtho there
so the romanesque abbey, the philosophical church, gothic art, saxon art, the heavy round pillar recalling gregory vii, the hermetic symbolism which made nicolas flamel the precursor of luther, papal unity, schism, saint-germain-des-prés, saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie, everything is merged, combined, amalgamated in notre-dame
soon at the edge of the stockades there rose two crossed standards, the accepted sign for requesting corpses
that’s a good sentence!
his body is already all broken
i have the hammer and the nail, and those implements are no more fearsome in my hands than a mallet in the hands of a cutler—yet all that is needed is to find the magic word that ezekiel pronounced when he hit the nail
raucous cries came out of their bushy beards; their torn coats of mail beat against their sword-hilts, and through the holes in the bronze could be seen their naked members, as fearful as weapons of war
but spendius reassured them
while daedalus, who is strength, took measurements, while orpheus, who is intelligence, sang, the pillar, which is a letter, the arcade, which is a syllable, the pyramid, which is a word, set in motion at once by a geometrical and a poetic law, were grouping, combining, blending, rising, descending, lying in juxtaposition on the ground, rising in tiers into the sky, until they had written at the dictation of the general idea of an epoch those wonderful books which were also wonderful buildings: the pagodas of eklinga, the ramesseum of egypt, the temple of solomon
he huddled against his chest, like a child frightened by a ghost
it’s the archdeacon of josas,  said fleur-de-lys
several times above the crowd, they exchanged insults, which went unheard
try taking a bone away from a tiger!
and without any signal or word of command the soldiers from utica and those from the bridge ran pell-mell in a combined attack on hamilcar
and the proctors’ sideboards!
at that the student said, looking at once grave and resolute: all right, brother, i’m sorry to have to tell you that i have received from other quarters some very handsome offers and proposals
that’s enough, sire,  tristan answered
he was obliged to sit down, so intense was his shock
he went on, come here!
while he still paid her occasional visits, from some remnant of human respect, he felt doubly uncomfortable with fleur-de-lys; first, because as a result of scattering his affections in all sorts of places he had kept back very little for her; then because in the midst of so many stiff, starched, and proper lovely ladies he went in constant fear lest his mouth, so accustomed to bad language, might suddenly take the bit between its teeth and run off into the language of the tavern
in paris there were quite a number of such cells for praying to god and doing penance; almost all were occupied
the victim was fastened on to this wheel, kneeling, with his arms behind his back
you, your shadow, the image of the luminous apparition which had one day crossed the space before me
hamilcar’s daughter no longer extended her fasts with such fervour
she’s the recluse in the rat-hole
after the kingdom of the argoteers came the empire of galilee
and his hand went to the hilt of his dagger
it is a boar!
the two distinct crowds mingled without becoming confused, the one dressed in linen or wool with felt caps like pine cones, and the other dressed in armour and helmeted
first came a buzzing in the ears, nails went black, the chest went cold, they lay on their side and expired without a cry
tristan cast a sidelong look at the recluse
the whistle he had given her she had left lying on the ground
i was full of religion for love of her; and i saw you through her smile as though through an opening in the heavens—oh!
then tight lipped he crouched back on the cushions; he tore the fringes with his nails, breathing heavily, with staring eyes
the fugitives reappeared one by one, like shadows; the women too risked returning, for there still remained some, especially with the libyans, despite the appalling massacre committed by the numidians
sweat ran down his chest, between the squareness of his muscles; and his breathing shook his sides with the bronze belt set with leather thongs which hung down to his knees, more solid than marble
and then he laughed again, at the thought that phoebus was still alive, that after all the captain was living, was merry and contented, had finer actons than ever, and a new mistress whom he was taking to see the old one hang
hamilcar stepped over him
thirty stalwart fellows, square-limbed, with the look of locksmiths, stepped out from the ranks with hammers, pincers, and iron bars on their shoulders
he added: be my son and defend your father!
however, at intervals her blue lips parted in a breath, and quivered, but as lifelessly and mechanically as leaves shifting in the wind
gringoire was extremely put out
it was the formidable figure of quasimodo
perhaps she is there among them!
come on, you’ll be second up
the entire human race is on the scaffolding
what does it matter after all?
all his men together gave a great shout, and mâtho, carried away by this anger, cried that he accepted the alliance
her hands were untied, she was made to get down, accompanied by her goat, which had been also untied and was bleating with joy at feeling free, and they made her walk barefoot over the hard pavement to the foot of the steps of the portal
this was, however, the sole human contact remaining to her—the gaoler’s periodic visit
on the terrace of the temple of khamon gigantic pieces of gold plate weighed down three long tables at which the priests, the elders, and the rich would sit, and there was a fourth one, for hamilcar, narr’havas, and her; for, as salammbo had saved the fatherland by recovering the veil, the people were making her marriage into a day of national rejoicing, and below, in the square, waited for her to appear
the pretty pink feet especially never ceased to amaze her and send her into transports of delight!
carians proudly tossed their helmet plumes, cappadocian archers had painted great flowers on their bodies with herbal juices, and some lydians in woman’s dress wore slippers and earrings as they dined
forgive me, mademoiselle,  gringoire said with a smile, but why did you take me for a husband?
by the way, master,  gringoire suddenly went on, as we came out on to the parvis through those crazy truands, did your reverence notice the poor little devil whose brains your deaf man was busy dashing out against the balustrade of the gallery of kings?
it was narr’havas who had been following him for some time, step by step, with one of those large nets used for catching wild beasts, and profiting from the moment he was bending down, had thrown it over him
the newcomer took another step forward: jupiter!
whom do you have to thank for breathing this air, seeing that sky, and being still able to amuse your lark’s brain with frivolities and follies?
she was not much concerned about that
where’s bellevigne de l’étoile?
so they do not answer!
the wavering, feeble illumination from the fires enabled gringoire to make out, confused as he was, all round the vast square a hideous frame of old houses, whose rotten, shrivelled, stunted façades, each pierced by one or two lighted attic windows, looked to him in the darkness like the heads of old women, standing in a circle, monstrous and baleful, watching the witches’ sabbath with blinking eyes
it was a redoubt, circular in shape, carpeted with mats of gleaming straw, the ceiling beams embellished with fleurs-de-lys of gilded tin and the space in between painted, panelled with ornate woodwork sprinkled with rosettes of white tin, and painted a beautiful bright green, made of orpiment and fine indigo
the old church, all vibrating and resonant, lived in a perpetual rejoicing of bells
we must make a bonfire this evening in the champ-gaillard,  the other continued, with maître andry’s books
the dummy had already been taken down to make room for him
here,  answered a black robe she had not noticed before
the king could not stop himself saying: good!
down with the doctors!
some of rembrandt’s pictures have that sort of background
it was the accused
the grave or my bed!
his fortress was still to be seen in number today barely his church remains
but… that’s my nasty animal,  said old falourdel, and i recognize both of them right enough!
it’s the melancholy lot of men of my profession to walk the streets at night
it is still the same inner framework, the same logical disposition of the parts
she replied with a negative nod of her head, and her pensive gaze fixed on the room’s vaulted ceiling
you will leave their huts open every night so that they can mix freely
although sicca was a sacred city it could not hold such large numbers; the temple, with its dependencies, alone took up half of it
it hid behind a wall of lake mud and defended on top by thorny brushwood
finally when it was fifty cubits up in the air it turned right and left several times, then lowered; and like a giant arm holding a cohort of pygmies in its hand, it set down the basket full of men on the edge of the wall
among other things she had a pair of little shoes!
but not a bit of interest in our lady the virgin mary
couldn’t they at least be left to swear in peace and utter the odd profanity on such a fine day, in the excellent company of churchmen and harlots?
phoebus could not see him
she and her mother just scraped a living
you will avenge us, kill me!
the condemned girl stayed unmoving where she was, waiting for them to dispose of her
they rushed upon the blades held out
so saying she threw her arms round the officer’s neck, looked up at him beseechingly and smiling beautifully amid her tears, her delicate breasts rubbed against his woollen doublet and its rough braid
i shall writhe on the ground, break stone with my forehead, damn myself, and curse you, lord, if you keep my child from me!
she could not have come for the zaïmph?
two voices were speaking there
it was a place without cover
that is too much!
then, jehan went back to the wench, and broke a bottle which was on a table, exclaiming:
lent to tigillas, until the end of the season, two kikars at /% marine interest; to bar-malkarth,  shekels against the pledge of thirty slaves
saint louis of france, my master, transgressed the church of monsieur saint paul for the same purpose; and monsieur alphonse, the king of jerusalem’s son, even the church of the holy sepulchre
the provost addressed him sternly: what have you done then to be here, scoundrel?
but i want her!
nor can our cathedral be placed in that other family of lofty, airy churches, rich with stained glass and sculpture; of pointed forms and bold attitudes; communal and civic as political symbols, free, fanciful and unrestrained as works of art; a second transformation of architecture, no longer hieroglyphic, immutable, and priestly, but artistic, progressive, and popular, which begins with the return from the crusades and ends with louis xi
at the moment when we introduced the reader to it, this little room was very dark
i’ll go round the taverns, i’ll fight, i’ll break pots, and i’ll visit the girls!
he intended to take the pont saint-michel; children were running about on the bridge with squibs and rockets
so they went to it with a will; and amid the general clamour came a fearful chorus of blasphemies and obscenities from all these unbridled tongues of clerks and students, restrained for the rest of the year by fear of saint louis’s branding irons on their tongues
quasimodo contented himself with seizing him round the waist and hurling him ten yards into the crowd
you’ll be hanged,  the other replied without hesitation
within their range, at the foot of the formidable building, lies the porte saint-antoine, hidden between its two towers
coins of gold, silver, and bronze, laid out on tables or put away in recesses, piled along all four walls up to the roofbeams
it was all her fault
it was one of those famous cages for prisoners of state known as the king’s little girls’
i saw your foot, that foot for which i would have given an empire to kiss just once and die, that foot which i should have been so overjoyed to feel crushing my head, i saw that foot clamped in that horrible boot which turns the limbs of a living creature into bloody mush
the hosier’s patriotism was flattered
it’s rather hard to explain,  the poet answered
oh, twenty if you like, master!
it had let all the water with which it had been filled run out, and the flowers in it were withered
you’re putting a lot of warmth into that oath!
they explained themselves more clearly, saying they must have hanno’s head
but parisians rarely harbour a grudge; and then, by having the performance begin on their own authority, the good citizens had scored over the cardinal, and that triumph was enough for them
she was crazy about her, and kept thanking god for her
to the left the monolithic, firm, dense, compacted, bristling trapezium of the university
then she started clapping her hands again, laughing and shouting: we are going to be happy!
mâtho resumed command of his soldiers
ideo, domni, coram stryga demonstrata, crimine patente, intentione criminis existente, in nomine sanctae ecclesiae nostrae-dominae parisiensis, quae est in saisina habendi omnimodam altam et bassam justitiam in ilia hac intemerata civitatis insula, tenore praesentium declaramus nos requirere; primo, aliquandam pecuniariam indemnitatem; secundo, amendationem honorabilem ante portalium maximum nostrae-dominae, ecclesiae cathedralis; tertio, sententiam in virtute cujus ista stryga cum sua capella, seu in trivio vulgariter dicto la grève, seu in insula exeunte in fluvio sequanae, juxta pointam jardinis regalis, executae sint!
goodness, what a pretty voice you have!
the flames from the lamp flickered in gusts of hot air
what about it, comrades?
to weaken the mercenaries the suffete had thought it wise to keep him busy far away in his kingdom
it was a strange reversal
add a score of secondary groups, serving maids and lads rushing about with jugs on their head, gamblers squatting over their billiards, marbles, dice, vachettes, the exciting game of tringlet, quarrels in one corner, kisses in another, and you will have some idea of the whole scene, over which the brightness of a great blazing fire flickered, making a thousand distorted and grotesque shadows dance over the tavern walls
beneath the stranger’s brows he met a gaze no less piercing and mistrustful than his own
that’s one defect missing,  observed jehan
rejoice, light of the baals!
even if you were satan l’hermite,  gudule replied, regaining hope, i wouldn’t tell you any different and i wouldn’t be afraid of you
here and there golden plates glinted as they moved
the town seemed to be roused
they were swarthy, with crinkly hair and silver rings in their ears
it was laden with houses, of which only the dark silhouette could be made out, boldly picked out in black against the light background of sky and water
look not at the face,
gradually he had come closer; the smell of blood, the sight of slaughter and the trumpets’ clamour had finally made his heart leap
on the upper end of the two posts they fitted a crossbar, the whole forming a very neat portable gallows, which gringoire had the satisfaction of seeing erected before him in the twinkling of an eye
god’s great thunderbolts are not for bombarding lettuces
coictier went red with anger
the only place i can take her is to la falourdel’s, the bawd on the bridge, and i’ll have to pay for the room
all right,  he cried, to the devil!
meanwhile mâtho’s immobility amazed spendius, he was even paler than before, and with staring eyes was following something on the horizon, leaning with both hands on the edge of the terrace
so, maître olivier, take this as said
nor was it the arrival of some embassy, a frequent occurrence in the fifteenth century, all bedizened and plumed
in his hand he carried one of those whips with white leather thongs used at that time by the sergeants of the wand for pushing back the crowd, and which were called boullayes
quasimodo was too deaf and claude too rapt in thought to take in all these gracious comments
suddenly the whole town rose up; blue, yellow and white veils waved on the walls, in the red evening glow
they lifted up the hyacinth curtain hanging in front of the door; and through the opening of that corner could be seen, beyond the other rooms, the great rosy sky which seemed to continue the vault, resting on the horizon upon the deep blue sea
one evening he casually asked mâtho if there were no springs inside the city
monsieur is interested in science?
she felt as though she were supported by the strength of the gods; and looking him in the face she demanded the zaïmph, asking for it in proud and eloquent words
yes’, there was some ineffable quality which made fleur-de-lys feel hurt
she fell to the pavement inert
it was, be it said in passing, a strange destiny for the church of notre-dame at that time to be thus loved to two different degrees and so devotedly by two beings as dissimilar as claude and quasimodo; loved by the one, a kind of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, its stature, the harmonies emanating from its magnificent whole; loved by the other, a man of learned and passionate imagination, for what it signified, its myth, for the meaning it contained, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its façade like the original text beneath a later one in a palimpsest; in a word, for the enigma it offered eternally to the intellect
cripple slaves, for tank’s sake!
the voice was that of phoebus de châteaupers
the king will rule in arras;
that’s the time of my appointment
unlike hanno, hamilcar would probably not go by the hot-springs mountain
the sky was white, the river water was white
my name’s jehan frollo, and my brother is an archdeacon
but suddenly the space broadened out, and they recognized the western face of the acropolis
a cry of horror went up from the truands
the victims were barely at the edge of the opening when they disappeared like a drop of water on a red hot plate, and a puff of white smoke rose up against the great scarlet mass
spendius squatted at the edge of the fountain, washing his bloody hands
the bohemian shook his head
i came within a hair’s breadth of being hanged
the numidian stayed with the mercenaries
certainly,  gringoire answered, rather taken aback by the question
a child tore off his ear; a girl, hiding the point of a spindle under her sleeve, split open his cheek; they tore out handfuls of hair, strips of flesh; others with sticks on which were stuck sponges soaked in filth dabbed at his face
by becoming a truand i cheerfully gave up half of a house in paradise that my brother promised me—dimidiam domum in paradiso [half a house in paradise/the parvis]
the beginning will have been good
next taanach slipped a large robe on her, made of cloth from the seres’ country, white with green stripes
they saw her in this attitude fearlessly eyeing all those soldiers with a gaze which had become once more wild and crazy
monsieur le recteur, it’s no one’s fault, the small shambles, parva boucheria
… salvum me fac, deus, quoniam intraverunt aquae usque ad animam meam
spendius, standing against the barrier, had them carefully searched; mâtho, facing him, examined the crowd, looking for someone whom he might have seen at salammbo’s
there is a diana flying in the air, but so outstanding, so tender, so delicate, her action so artless, her hair so beautifully dressed, crowned with a crescent, her flesh so white that it leads into temptation those who look at it with too much curiosity
he told spendius that evening
then he began running all over the church, looking for his gypsy, bellowing strange cries at every corner of the walls, scattering his red hair over the pavement
little jehan frollo, nicknamed du moulin, of the mill’, from the place where he had been put out to nurse, had not grown up along the lines which claude had tried to imprint upon him
she had dragged herself to her place
her small foot too was andalusian, for it fitted both snugly and easily into her dainty shoe
her former character came back too, even some of her gaiety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her taste for singing, her modesty
autharitus’s army now extended from tunis to rhades
the movement of its web made the huge spider suddenly shoot out of its central cell, then with one bound it pounced on the fly, bending it in two with its front antennae, while its hideous trunk scooped out the head
it was the season when the doves of carthage emigrated to sicily, to the mountain of eryx, round the temple of venus
numerous bodies of men left
when he entered the cell, he found it empty
provisions were scattered from their baskets; lumps of salt, packets of gum, rotten dates, guru nuts were trodden underfoot; and sometimes on a breast crawling with vermin, hanging on a slender cord, was some diamond sought after by satraps – an almost fabulous stone, enough to buy an empire
the archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard
this quotation which the student borrowed, perhaps to make mischief, from the cell’s wall, had a singular effect on the priest
so the people of malqua found themselves caught between the old enclosure of byrsa from behind and the barbarians in front
she is remote and quite inaccessible!
thus saying, she gazed at the captain with her large black eyes moist with joy and affection
there were only two distinct images left in his mind: la esmeralda and the gallows
twenty times during the night he got up to supervise everything himself down to the smallest details
this look lasted only for a flash
said the king in a low voice, pale and trembling with rage
look at him trotting along on his mule!
they drew up on the plain, forming a circle in front of him
at that he cried loudly: gudule!
hopes of deliverance revived
barca, carthage needs you to take command of all the punic forces against the mercenaries!
he did not finish
the thought of his son, like the touch of a god, had suddenly calmed him
he lost three more months equipping the  elephants which were kept on the ramparts; they were the conquerors of regulus; the people cherished them, and no treatment was too good for these old friends
they waited until he was in a good position in front of them
the captain was a brave man and would have been scarcely upset by a robber with a rapier in his hand
the carthaginians arrived on the plain before they did
why had he abandoned them, once peace had been concluded?
and then my mystery will bring me in a lot of hard cash, if they ever pay me for it
a good number of these honest spectators had been shivering since daybreak in front of the great steps of the palais; some even claimed to have spent the night lying in the great doorway to be sure of entering first
all the thought of that time is in fact written in that sombre romanesque style
she felt a lascivious hand straying over her
i don’t like that
the band of argoteers applauded clopin’s words and formed a circle round the gallows, laughing so unmercifully that gringoire saw that he was providing them with too much sport not to have everything to fear from them
corpses, too tightly squeezed in the crowd, did not fall; held up by their comrades’ shoulders they went on upright and staring for several minutes
the libyans also complained
human skeletons could be seen along the walls
the archdeacon had gone extremely pale
everyone rushed to the chapel
the crowd of servants parted, and mâtho passed slowly through them with bowed head; but at the door he stopped, for the fringe of the zaïmph had caught on one of the golden stars paving the flags
and then they remade it; a claim that at least neither time nor revolutions had advanced
that’s right, my good friend jehan, my poor comrade, the rue galiache, that’s right, quite right
to hasten their death they used tricks; the last remnant of their disgusting ration was stolen from them; they were trampled on, as if by accident; the dying, to make people believe they were vigorous, tried to stretch out their arms, raise themselves up, laugh
behind the purple works, whence blue smoke rose slowly into the sky, a jackal’s bark rang out; hamilcar stopped
clopin made a sign
this man, whose clothes were concealed by the crowd around him, did not look more than number years old; yet he was bald; at his temples he had scarcely more than a few scanty tufts of hair already grey; his broad, high forehead was beginning to be furrowed with wrinkles; but in his deep-set eyes shone an extraordinary youthfulness, ardent vitality, intense passion
so he would sometimes spend hours at a time squatting in front of one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it
then they turned everything upside down in confusion: mules, servants, the litter, the stores, the baggage
several times a day they came out of their camp
after all, nature was not dumb in the poor devil, and his spinal column, dreadfully misshapen though it was, was no less sensitive to excitement than anyone else’s
that was the embassy from flanders
it’s a cat of mine,  the archdeacon said quickly, treating himself to a mouse or something under there
at once he ran through the crowd, calling: master!
greenish strips hung from their foreheads; they were hacked to pieces, crushed to the marrow, turned blue by choking, or split in two by the elephants’ tusks
it was freedom of architecture
they vied with each other to get their clutches on him
a graft occurs, sap circulates, vegetation continues
the cardinal was in torment
the soldiers and the numidians were so tightly packed together that they could not draw their swords
moloch, you are burning me!
to which his companion this time replied: yes, i think so
as his spongy bones would not hold under the iron spikes, bits of his limbs had come away, and all that remained on the cross were shapeless bits and pieces, like those animal fragments that hunters hang on their doors
at that time there was no lighting in the parvis de notre-dame
yes, lord, they have just now dashed his head before my eyes against the stones of your house, and it is because of me, because of this woman, because of her…
listen to me, my friends!
or rather we have all ruined each other through the inexplicable play of fatality!
i’m unlucky enough to live near notre-dame; all night long i hear him prowling about in the guttering
quasimodo threw down at his feet, bit by bit, the student’s iron shell
i don’t see why i should have myself hanged in another person’s place
she was there, lost in the darkness, buried, interred, walled up
she started to dance again
through the forest he pursued the she-monster whose tail coiled over the dead leaves like a silver stream; and he came to a meadow where women, with the hindquarters of dragons, stood around a great fire, raised on the tips of their tails
la esmeralda’s in the place!
gringoire listened to him at first with an undecided look, then he softened, and ended by pulling a tragic grimace which made his wan face look like that of a newborn baby with colic
gringoire stopped up his ears
the ground shook beneath the stamp of countless feet
taanach went back up into the room
the king’s palaces, princely residences, churches especially had the right of asylum
for digging and searching in certain places, both in paris and elsewhere, for treasure said to be hidden, but without finding anything—number livres parisis
what about this mahiet fargel,  went on the archdeacon, whose gown you tore?
i shall do still more: you shall see!
and like a hind catching the scent of the hounds, she stood up, hurried to the window, opened it, and rushed on to the balcony
rows of arches, one behind the other, opened out in the middle of large walls separating basins
mercy, eye of baal!
the worthy deaf man, assailed on every side, had lost, if not all heart, at least all hope of saving, not himself, he had no thought of himself, but the gypsy girl
what is there to laugh at?
lay siege to the church, smash down the doors, take out the beautiful girl, save her from the judges, save her from the priests, wreck the cloister, burn the bishop in his palace, we’ll do it in less time than it takes a burgomaster to eat a spoonful of soup
good fat oudarde was getting ready to reply, and the quarrel might have led to blows, if mahiette had not suddenly cried out: just look at all those people flocking together there at the end of the bridge!
he bent over to speak in her ear and added (the spectators thought he was hearing her last confession): will you have me?
she thought now only how happy she would be to see the zaïmph again, and how she blessed schahabarim for his exhortations
four sergeants of the bailiff of the palais, whose duty was to stand guard over all popular entertainments, whether holidays or executions, stood at the four corners of the marble table
he came to visit salammbo
besides, it is still the same today, the mouth of any scholar who pays compliments to another is a jar of honeyed venom
soon the two masses formed a single chain of human bodies; it flowed over into the intervals of the terrace, and a little looser at each end, rolled about continually without making progress
it was apparently then that, as he was trying to work out in the depths of his desolate reflections who could so unexpectedly have abducted the gypsy, he thought of the archdeacon
he said in the tone of a man just waking up
they lived there, without rulers or religion, all mixed together, completely naked, both sickly and wild, execrated by the people for centuries because of their disgusting diet
all of a sudden lights appeared on the topmost terrace of the palace, the middle door opened, and a woman, hamilcar’s daughter herself, dressed in black, appeared on the threshold
meanwhile the ranks of the clibanarii lay extended over the plain; the mercenaries tore their armour off them, put it on, then returned to the fight
they took my child away, they stole my child, they ate my child
don’t bite me, monster!
the three long vessels, filled almost to sinking point, advanced to the applause of the watching army
mouths open to cry remained gaping; hands flew as they were lopped off
no one could follow them or even speak to them, or approach the ramparts; for a few minutes the whole town was as silent as a huge tomb
suddenly he was choked by sobs, and collapsing to his knees:
asylums were hedged about with such respect that, according to tradition, it extended at times even to animals
they had been telling me for the past few days: la falourdel, don’t work too hard at your spinning-wheel in the evenings, the devil likes to comb old women’s distaffs with his horns
they give me an écu
the priest struck his forehead
beneath her hair, which spread out down to the ground, a harsh and wasted profile could just be discerned; from her robe just the tip of a bare foot protruded, clenched on the freezing, unyielding stone
in the middle twelve copper pedestals each bore a great glass ball, and vague gleams of red filled these hollow globes, like enormous eyeballs still pulsing with life
said mâtho, i will go on with the war all alone!
hamilcar seized the slave with one leap; covering the man’s mouth with his hands, he cried still louder:
she wanted to know him better and yet his presence would have embarrassed her
as if it were something impossible and hamilcar someone immortal
the wheel began to turn
this little bedroom’ which the king had kept for himself in the famous state prison was still spacious enough, and occupied the top floor of a turret set into the keep
they felt seized with shame, and anger, at having been kept in check for so long before the church by a hunchback
the elders had been dragged away
they filled the street so that the walls almost burst, and this long mass of armed soldiers streamed out between the tall rows of six-storied houses, daubed with tar
but soon realizing that any denial would be vain, hamilcar gave way; and he showed them into the trading house
the two visitors withdrew
it’s true,  he said, i was forgetting that we are in a hurry—but that’s no reason, master, to rage at people so
in a few minutes the sentence was drawn up
the captain roared with laughter: corne de baœuf!
i think i touched his heart with the tip
her arms, adorned with diamonds, were left bare outside a sleeveless tunic, spangled with red flowers on a dead black background
this grand staircase, as i say, poured ceaselessly into the place like a cascade into a lake
if you have come from hell, i am going there with you
they shook their collars full of little bells, trumpeted; and their drivers bent their heads beneath the shower of fire-arrows which began to rain from the towers
then they penetrated into a small, completely circular room, so high that it looked like the inside of a pillar
you know, madame, that many most pious princes have trespassed against the privilege of churches for the glory of god and the needs of the state
the phalanx exterminated the remnant of the barbarians at their leisure
spendius, who had spent three years in the slave prison, did not know the districts at all well
the human heart (dom claude had meditated on such matters) can contain only a certain amount of despair
the immense accumulation at carnac is already a completed formula
the university was built on hilly ground
so the disaster he had feared for so long had come, and he sought frantically to see whether there was no way, no means of escape
as he said this in his gentlest voice, he came extremely close to the gypsy girl, his fondling hands resumed their position around that delicate, supple waist, his eyes grew brighter and brighter, and all the evidence proclaimed that monsieur phoebus was clearly on the brink of one of those moments when jupiter himself commits such follies that good homer is obliged to enlist the aid of a cloud
at the corner of the street of sateb he leaned against the low roof of a shop, back to the wall, and went no further
this spectator had missed nothing of what had been going on since midday before the portal of notre-dame
spendius fell in a faint on the mat
and she went back to stroking the pretty creature, saying over and over: djali!
he put a question or two to her all the same
the church is watched day and night
so claude crouched down in the dust and lumps of plaster which crumbled beneath him
you ask why i rescued you
and heedless of their clamouring, he said that in abandoning the suffete, it was the republic they had abandoned
and she had the sweetest fine dark hair, which was already curling
the unclean-eaters thought up atrocious things
what a feeling one has of waters falling, sap failing, the thought of ages and peoples withdrawing from it!
let’s get a move on, she would recognize me
phoebus,  the gypsy continued, gently removing the captain’s tenacious hands from round her waist, you are kind, you are generous, you are handsome
and to have nothing to offer her but a dingy priest’s cassock which would fill her with fear and disgust!
there was no cavalry to extricate them, except for  numidians who turned against the right-hand squadron of the clibanarii
that’ll do,  trouillefou broke in, without letting him finish
during an eclipse she had almost died
it was indefinable and charming; something pure, resonant, airy, winged, so to speak
the phalanx began to waver, the captains ran about in dismay, the rear numbers pushed the soldiers, and the barbarians had reformed; they were returning; victory was theirs
then he went off towards the cape of grapes and made a long detour to encircle the barbarians, an inopportune and even dangerous operation
it was impossible for the barbarians to resist; only the greek infantry had bronze weapons; all the others had cutlasses on the ends of poles, sickles taken from farms, swords made out of wheel-rims; the blades were too soft and twisted as they struck, and while they tried to straighten them under their heels the carthaginians, to right and left, massacred them at leisure
none the less, to give criticism its due as well, the poet could have developed this fine idea in something less than two hundred lines
she had no doubt about it
name of a pope!
hell with you there is my heaven, the sight of you is more delightful than that of god!
pretty fine heart of oak,  said the king, thumping the frame work with his fist
under the rope sparkled a little amulet decorated with green glass beads, which she had been allowed to keep, no doubt because nothing is refused to those about to die
a procession of all the gentlemen of france, with their oriflammes blazing red for all to see
eh, you lynx, haven’t you ever lain with your mate?
a plague on all fireworks!
a third was solemnly using his finger to spread over the table the melted tallow dripping from a candle
if you are to die, it will be later,  he said, later!
good-day, monsieur le recteur!
said gringoire, lost in the innumerable twists and turns, continually doubling back on themselves, but through which the girl followed a path which she seemed to know well, without hesitating and walking ever faster and faster
you are not well!
and each of them is deep, fifty cubits and full to the top!
hamilcar was quite sure that no one could take his son away from him
that’s right,  rym whispered to coppenole, punish the people for wanting, and do what they wanted
along the narrow paths the sentries marched to keep warm, or stood looking towards the horizon, with their pikes on their shoulders in a threatening attitude
he had, though, never felt such anxiety; if he succumbed it meant the destruction of the republic and he would perish on a cross; if, on the other hand, he won, by way of the pyrenees, gaul, and the alps he would reach italy and the barca’s empire would be eternal
it is still the same fibre vibrating, the deepest and most sensitive one; but instead of an angel stroking it, it is a demon who plucks it cruelly
guillaume rym made a deep bow, while coppenole, with his surly expression, looked like one of those bears his majesty had been speaking about
sometimes a plump hand, covered with rings, half opened the litter; a harsh voice shouted insults; then the bearers would stop, and take another route through the camp
an influence had come down from the moon upon the maiden; when the star was on the wane salammbo grew weaker
in paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords claiming quit-rent, there were twenty-five claiming justice and quit-rent, from the bishop of paris, who had a hundred and five streets, to the prior of notre-dame-des-champs, who had four
they moved aside when he went by, rolling his huge blue eyes
the spectacle it was awaiting was obviously one of those which are privileged to bring out and attract the lowest dregs of the population
what’s the matter with you that you’re whispering like that?
that’s a fine milch-cow for you
the archdeacon held out his hand to him: that’s settled then?
he began to flee through the church
finally, as their drivers were called indians’ (after the first ones, no doubt, who had come from india), he ordered that they should all be dressed in indian style, that is with a white padded band round their temples and a small loin cloth of byssus, which with its transverse folds looked like the two halves of a seashell fitting round their hips
this cell had been famous in paris for nearly three centuries, ever since madame rolande of the tour-roland, in mourning for her father who had died on the crusades, had had it hollowed out from the wall of her own house and there shut herself up for ever, retaining of her palace nothing but this dwelling, of which the door was walled up and the window open, winter and summer; all the rest she gave to the poor and to god
after a moment a symphony, intended to produce a striking effect as the holy virgin arrived, failed to materialize
and he closed the book violently
it was on the first day, but i got stung
the girl kneeling before the gibbet, covered by her long, flowing hair, let him speak without interruption
there is an old charter which expresses it artlessly, on the subject of loyalty: fidelitas in reges, quae tamen aliquoties seditionibus interrupta, multa peperit privilegia [loyalty to kings, although interrupted by a certain number of insurrections, has won many privileges])
he reckoned that there is nothing like the spectacle of a criminal trial for driving away melancholy, entertaining as the judges’ stupidity usually is
you can see that i am putting it together
if the reader wishes to know by whom, he has only to listen in to the conversation of three worthy gossips who, at the moment when we fixed our attention on the rat-hole, were proceeding in the very same direction as they walked beside the river up from the châtelet towards the grève
good-night father, good-night mother!
but woken by the sound of voices and footsteps they slowly stood up, came towards the elders, whom they recognized from their dress, rubbed against their legs and arched their backs with resounding yawns; their steaming breath passed over the light from the torches
behind, in the shadow cast by this trellis, a small boat lay hidden
meanwhile the chief truands had withdrawn beneath the porch of the gondelaurier mansion and were holding a council of war
salammbo, almost in a faint, was carried back on to her throne by priests bustling round her
lasciate ogni speranza[all hope abandon …]
as his distress increased, so their joy became greater, and amid catcalls those at the back cried out:
between mankind and himself the condemned person felt weighing down on his head an accumulation of stones and gaolers, and the whole prison, the massive fortress, was just an immense, complex lock shutting him out from the world of the living
she approached, seized the weapon by the hilt
in the daytime one could admire the variety of its buildings, all carved in stone or wood, and already offering complete samples of the different types of medieval domestic architecture, going back from the fifteenth through to the eleventh century, from the casement which was beginning to oust the ogive, back to the round romanesque arch which the ogive had supplanted, and which still occupied, beneath the ogive, the first floor of that ancient house of the tour-roland, in the corner of the place giving on to the seine, on the rue de la tannerie side
mâtho wanted to go up in the first to be ready
the good man had no other fields to cultivate but the king’s ill health
get a move on,  said tristan
to speak to mâtho,  she answered
above the officers’ commands, the trumpets’ calls and the scraping of the lyres, lead bullets and clay pellets whistled through the air, tore swords out of men’s hands, the brains out of their skulls
thus quasimodo’s gratitude was deep, passionate, unbounded; and although his adoptive father’s face was often stern and overcast, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude had never faltered for a moment
i’d very much like to know if it is god’s grace that there should be in paris anyone else with highway rights but the king, any other justice than our parliament, any other emperor than us in this empire!
they had seen such sums come out of it that they judged it to be inexhaustible; gisco had buried some in his tent
the incense smoked more fiercely in its large burners, and the naked masseurs, sweating like sponges, squeezed over his joints a paste composed of corn, sulphur, black wine, bitches’ milk, myrrh, galbanum, and styrax
he was too far from the social state and too near the state of nature to know what shame was
touched by this, she raised her head to answer
all night the people split into groups and debated at the street corners
his sword was there, near you!
gringoire realized that his band had been taken off by the procession of the pope of fools
but the elephants, whose rations had been cut, were restless in their tethers
and to go every evening, as was his wont, to that charming house in the rue galilee, in the precincts of the palais-royal, which he held in the right of his wife, madame ambroise de lore, to rest from the fatigue of sending some poor devil to spend his night in that little cell in the rue de l’escorcherie, which the provosts and échevins of paris were wont to use as their prison; it being number feet long, number feet number inches wide and n feet high
said jehan, that was nothing much!
they grew denser, larger; black mounds swayed along; suddenly square thickets appeared; it was the elephants and lances; a single cry rose up: the carthaginians!
my friends, my name is jehan du moulin, and i’m a gentleman
not for the banal reason that fire warms our feet or cooks our soup, but because it gives off sparks
everything is there, the cost of digging pits to put the sow in, the five hundred bundles of sticks collected from the harbour at morsant, the three pints of wine and the bread, the victim’s last meal, fraternally shared with the executioner, down to the eleven days of guarding and feeding the sow at number deniers parisis a day
olivier knelt down, and said coldly: sire, a witch has been condemned to death by your court of parliament
salammbo let herself slide down to him; and they made off at full gallop, circling the punic camp, looking for a gate somewhere
if only you could break that dreadful web with your gnat’s wings, you think you could reach the light!
mâtho felt his heart torn and his faith, as it were, betrayed
he embarked once more on flight
i don’t have any
this time he did not correct himself
the negress flung herself to the ground at his feet, and tried to kiss them; he roughly picked her up
everything was wiped out, everything was black
she took her feet in her hands, a habitual gesture of unhappy creatures who are cold, already observed in the recluse of the tour-roland, and her teeth chattered
they did not hurt her, but when these men touched her, when the leather touched her, she felt all her blood run back into her heart
were we now to try to penetrate as far as quasimodo’s soul through that hard, thick crust; were we to plumb the depths of that misshapen organism; were it given to us to inspect with a torch behind those organs impermeable to light, to explore the dark interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate its obscure corners and absurd impasses, and suddenly to cast a bright light on the psyche chained up in the depths of that cavern, we should no doubt find the wretch in some pathetic, stunted, rachitic posture like those prisoners kept below the roof in venice, growing old bent double in a stone box too low and too short for movement
they are richer and less sacred
the asturian bull, unmoved by the picador’s attacks, is irritated by the dogs and banderillas
hamilcar went forward to the candelabra
in the angle of the pediments, on top of the walls, in the corner of the squares, everywhere, could be seen divinities with hideous heads, colossal or squat, with huge bellies or disproportionately flattened, opening their jaws, spreading their arms, holding forks, chains or javelins; and the blue of the sea lay at the bottom of the streets, made to look even steeper by the perspective
very well,  the king’s advocate said drily, he’s dying
but since you don’t like it, i don’t mind being called goton
the suffete had the idea of negotiations to gain time, and one morning the barbarians found in their lines a sheepskin covered with writing
they resumed their march
everywhere lay scattered gums, powders, roots, glass phials, branches of filipendula, rose petals; and the smells were suffocating, despite the swirls of styrax crackling in the middle on a bronze tripod
now and then this noise and clamour grew louder, the current driving the whole crowd towards the grand staircase ebbed, broke into turbulence and eddies
but i do, i see a lot of objections!
the gods dwell where their effigies are
it’s the bailiff burning
no, you don’t know it, you were too small!
she’s got it into her head
the greatest disasters,  answered mistricole
she came down the first staircase which ran diagonally along the first floor, then the second, the third, and she stopped, on the last terrace, at the head of the galley staircase
said the king between two sips of tisane
the very next day he drew , gold kikars from the syssitia, and decreed a tax of  shekels on the rich
at that hour all the members of the syssitia were asleep
spendius had raised one of the slabs, entered the water, and then closed it again on himself
a new day was dawning
they had recognized quasimodo
the girl pulled a face
do i hate them?
the crowbars and hammers were working away below
the streets were invested, the church backed on to the river
he said, so that the strength of the serpents, children of the sun, may penetrate the marrow of your bones, and take courage, reflection of the gods!
eustache, who up to that moment had been distracted by a little cart pulled by a large dog, which had just gone by, suddenly noticed that his three guides were looking at something through the window and, seized with curiosity in his turn, he got up on a marker stone, stood on tiptoe and stuck his fat, red face in the opening as he cried: mother, do let me see then!
trembling and straining his eyes, he gazed, beyond eschmoûn, at the high terrace of a palace set above palm trees: an ecstatic smile lit up his face, as if some great light had dawned upon him; he opened his arms, sent kisses on the breeze and murmured: come, come!
the girl stayed motionless, frozen, speechless before the terrifying apparition, like a dove raising its head just as the round-eyed osprey looks into the nest
end of the gold écu turned into a dry leaf
quasimodo leaned out over the square and saw that the object of this frantic, tender appeal was a young man, a captain, a handsome horseman, with gleaming weapons and finery, who was caracoling by at the far end of the square, and taking off his plumed hat to a lovely lady smiling on her balcony
the storm was moving away; occasional drops of water splashed one by one to vibrate the roof of the tent
just one little parisis, brother,  jehan persisted with his entreaty
he lived alone in his tent, with only a young boy by him, and no one ever ate with them, not even narr’havas, for whom, however, he showed extraordinary consideration since hanno’s defeat; but the numidian king had too much interest in becoming his son not to be wary
he looks at the sails passing far out to sea; he is gloomy, he refuses food, he asks questions about the gods, and he wants to know carthage
the carthaginians grinding their teeth looked at the top of the hill where the barbarians stood
meanwhile the captain’s gesture had uncovered the mysterious amulet that she wore round her neck
when he fell silent, exhausted and panting, she repeated faintly: oh!
anyhow,  added the first soldier, there isn’t a boat on this side of the water or on the other
some districts were already talking and making a noise
she entreated him with a suppliant look
he repeatedly sent messages urging autharitus and spendius to make haste
now we should like permission from those of our readers with the power to generalize an image or idea, as the modern style puts it, to ask whether they have a clear picture of the scene presented by the vast parallelogram of the great hall of the palais at the moment on which our attention is focused
the bronze statue continued to advance towards khamon square
this kind of tomb was in any case by no means rare in towns in the middle ages
the great silver cross glimmered in the depths of the darkness, sprinkled with a few points of twinkling light, like the milky way of that sepulchral night
she opened an eye, looked at quasimodo, then abruptly closed it again, as if terrified by her saviour
where are you going then?
some watched in the embrasures with fishing nets and when a barbarian arrived he found himself caught in the meshes and struggled like a fish
she saw a great body of armed men, on foot and on horseback, drawn up on the grève
he said in rapture, and flung his arm round the gypsy’s waist
the quay was absolutely deserted
these two images brought together confronted him with a terrifying group, and the more he concentrated on them what remained of his powers of attention and thought, the more he saw them grow, in a fantastic progression, the one in grace, charm, beauty, light, the other in horror, so that in the end la esmeralda appeared to him as a star, the gibbet as a huge fleshless arm
the punic slingers, pushed aside here and there, stayed gaping
the leather tent, turned up at the corners, gave a view of the whole mountainside covered with soldiers, and as she was at the centre, salammbo could be seen from every side
who told me so?
do you know who it might be?
it was known that there were scarcely , left, and to finish them off there was no need to use soldiers
are you really going to take my daughter from me?
a hundred and twenty livres, and not even parisis
it was indeed the first month of the year
then they saw a long scar on his pale forehead; it twitched like a snake between his eyebrows; he was trembling in every limb
the king of tunis went on
the laughing band of children was already far off
at once he sent off narr’havas to guard the borders of his kingdom
they danced deliriously round the great waterfall and, in the wildness of their joy, ran into it to wet their heads
for pity’s sake, tell me if he is alive!
as for jehan frollo, he was in a critical situation
but today there was resentment against them because the money was not there to pay them
i could cast myself at your knees; why!
the streets grew deeper and narrower; every open space was filled up and disappeared
horn and thunder,  said one of the two drinkers
the second effect of his misfortune was to make him vicious
vanished with the mother,  mahiette replied
she murmured, it’s the icy hand of death,—who are you, then?
beside this breviary is a narrow, pointed window, closed by two intersecting iron bars, looking on to the square, the only opening which admits a little fresh air and daylight to a small doorless cell, set at ground level in the thickness of the old house’s wall, and filled with a peace made all the more profound, a silence made all the more mournful by the fact that a public square, the noisiest and busiest in paris, teems and yells all around
there was no sound but the whirr of crickets
recall these impressions, and you will easily realize what gringoire felt as he contemplated in visible and palpable form that esmeralda of whom, up till then, he had caught only a glimpse through a whirlwind of dance, song, and excitement
the soldier’s terror as he examines the bronze battering ram and says: the tower will crumble
one in particular had a great gleaming scythe for a long time mowing at the horses’ legs
the crowd clapped their hands
a month, maybe two weeks, my lord
the man did not fall
such an imperious demeanour intimidated him
their companions, waiting for them, and not seeing them come back, thought they had been betrayed
then leaning to speak in his ear: i have brought you with me to steal it!

their horses fidgeted, dazzled by the glare of the torches, which crackled in the darkness; the human spectre struggled and shouted:

all sorts of most violent weapons
some of them climbed up beside him

some appeared holding parasols, with parrots on their shoulders
demonades how i am suffering!
she did not seem to notice

about two years, or eighteen months, after the events which conclude this history, when they came to the cellar to look for the corpse of olivier le daim, who had been hanged two days before, and to whom charles viii granted the favour of being buried at saint-laurent in better company, they found among all these hideous carcasses two skeletons, one clasping the other in a strange embrace

compère coppenole—they serve no purpose
he had a linen robe, with flowers painted on it, and golden fringes at the bottom; two silver arrows held back his braided hair at the edge of his ears; his right hand rested on a pike shaft, decorated with amber rings and tufts of bristles

in most cases it was enough to present the tambourine to the goat in such and such a way to obtain from it the desired trick

the monotonous chant of those saying the offices, the people’s response to the priest, sometimes a mumble, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious vibration of the stained glass, the organ blaring out like a hundred trumpets, the three bell towers humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra, over which a gigantic musical scale leaped without cease up and down from congregation to bell tower, deadened her memory, her imagination, her pain

archdeacon claude was also believed to have made a thorough study of the colossal statue of saint christopher and the long, enigmatic figure which then stood at the entrance from the parvis and which the people derisively called monsieur legris but what everyone had been able to observe was the interminable hours he often spent, sitting on the parapet of the parvis, contemplating the statues of the doorway, sometimes examining the foolish virgins with their lamps upside down, sometimes the wise virgins with their lamps upright; at other times calculating the angle of sight of the crow on the left-hand doorway, looking at some mysterious point inside the church where the philosophers’ stone is surely hidden, if it is not in nicolas flamel’s cellar
quasimodo picked up his lantern and went down on to the platform between the towers for a closer view and to work out some means of defence

salammbo kept going forward; the barbarian knelt, and a long arrow pierced the hem of her robe
spendius, on the contrary, became bolder and more cheerful
