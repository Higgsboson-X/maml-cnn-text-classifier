she went in there, then closed the shining doors
from four fountains, close to each other in a row, clear water flowed in various directions,
or think about his fate
and so i died
you men should be ashamed
for hector and aeneas, troy's best men
and then himself climbed in the ocean-going boat
eumaeus, by telling me these things,
even fair-haired niobe remembered food,with twelve of her own children murdered in her home,her six young daughters and her six strong sons
which a craftsman had once planed with skill
who started all this business, not because
by myself and then rub on the olive oil
always asking questions about everything—
my friends, is there some man confident enoughof his own daring spirit to venture outamong stout-hearted trojans, to seeif he can trap an enemy soldier,some straggler, or catch wind of some reportof what the trojans say among themselves,whether they are keen to stay beside the ships,away from home, or to go back to the city,now that they have beaten the achaeans?
around him, his close companions were all busy, in a hurry to get their morning meal prepared
and get all the women in the house to come
who, as they grieve around me, drain my heart, whenever you are not among us
and bright red wine
on the broad back of the sea
and if a man is harsh
escorting mortal men when any man
what form of drama remained, if it was not to be born from the womb of music, in that mysterious half-light of the dionysian?
what each man's destiny will be or not,
that fair-haired artemis would strike at me,
only very few of them are better
be the sort of men who would defend him?
as we recall them
the swineherd will bring me to the city
should welcome any guest in front of him
standing by the altar, prayed to lord poseidon
o my friend, that day menoetius sent you from phthia in agamemnon's cause, he gave you orders
get up now, stranger, and go to the city
oh, how far from me then was just this entire doctrine of resignation!—
to see if you did, in fact, entertain
he slew imbrius, a spearman, son of mentor, who owned many horses
so now, daughter of zeus, tell us his story, starting anywhere you wish
handed it to the wise old woman, who smoothed it out, and folded it, then hung the tunic on a peg
on those murderers of our sons and brothers
the spear struck amphion, son of selagus,who owned much property in paesus, with many crops
both good and bad—i know what's going on
i am finished with you
aided by malicious sleep, have injured me
through that, such an strange idiosyncratic glimpse into the hellenic was granted to me that it had to appear to me as if our classical-hellenistic scholarship (which is so proud of itself) had up to this point known, for the most part, only how to gloat over games with shadows and trivialities
goddess athena with the gleaming eyes replied to zeus:
in aeschylus we acknowledge the union of the frightened zeus, worried about the end of his power, with the titan
calling out to them:
lycaon's fine son saw diomedes moving fastalong the plain, pushing trojan ranks in front of him, in complete disorder
he has, first of all, as a dionysian artist, become entirely one with the primordial oneness of his pain and contradictory nature and produces the reflection of this primordial oneness as music, if music can with justice be called a re-working of the world, its second coat
and weeping, the old man of the sea
from the doors, since i am here by myself
they leapt up to get armour on
but we will not be going back to our estates
they set torches in between,
will say it is a wedding
gleaming-eyed athena said these words and left,
who's been gone so long
what fools you are, you strangers, or else you come from somewhere far away—
i do not care at all if this annoys you
telemachus to speak about his father,
when she’d recovered and her spirit had returned, she started her lament
the gold one stopped that ash spear from aeneas
teucer, son of telamon, master of your people,my dear comrade, keep on shooting as you are doing
with his sons and sons-in-law, to his lovely home
that woman, more than anyone, has covered herself
which seemed to him the finest place to go onshore
with one hand, lycaon grabbed achilles' knee
he cut down twenty trees,
so i gave him a cunning answer:
amphimedon, what have you suffered,
so from your chariots take out of harnessthose horses with their lovely manes, feed them,then quickly bring here from the citycattle and stout sheep
now lies dead—i mean antinous, the one
seduced by his own force and power,
will certainly see to it you acquire
after i would said this, he stretched out his hands to starry heaven
with these words, odysseus pulled socus' strong spear out of his flesh and removed it from his shield
and make things difficult, or odysseus
some god's just told me—he came and stood beside me—that even now
he took the food in his two hands and set it down right there at his feet, on his tattered bag, and ate, while the minstrel sang his song throughout the hall
his dear nurse eurycleia
but i do not think there's one
stand witness, and wide heaven above,
how can i handle those shameful suitors,
get going, you two
with impunity, but he stopped by antinous,
and zeus' child, what a bold man you are!
in all sorts of ways—a courageous warrior,
swift-footed achilles rose to speak:
and i would not miss my parents or my home,
in spite of all their literature on dreams and numerous dream anecdotes, we can speak of the dreams of the greeks only hypothetically, although with fair certainty
so now the god made manifest talks and acts in such a way that he looks like an erring, striving, suffering individual
as soon as you have escaped the dark blue sea
he would laid no hand on his fast, black, well-decked ship
would you support the suitors or odysseus?
for me, if the gods keep me safe and i get home,peleus himself will find me a wife
for as danaans fought, they shed their own blood also
i learned of this
we made it home—
she was the only god present at this battle
so let's think now
whom he included with the animals
as hector spoke, death's final end slid over him
nausicaa gazed at him in admiration,
that we ca not string his bow, it's a disgrace
you wo not want to acquaint yourself with work
listen to me, trojans, dardanians, allies—victory clearly falls to war-loving menelaus
with many noble riches, to collapse
a skilful speaker full of ancient wisdom,
lie there, son of otrynteus, of all menthe one we fear the most
athena, daughter of aegis-bearing zeus, cried out—
mother, do not encourage me to grieve,
and observed what happens, then let him woo
but there are no wide plains in ithaca,
concerning the process just described, however, we may still say with equal assurance that it is merely a glorious appearance, namely, the aforementioned apollinian illusion whose influence aims to deliver us from the dionysian flood and excess
she spoke to him—her words had wings:
sons of atreus: these are, of course, menelaus and agamemnon, for whose sake many achaean kings joined the expedition to troy, because of a promise they had made to menelaus to help him recover his wife, helen
lying on the portico, resting in their beds,
glorious menelaus, everything you sayis true enough
he feels the actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more elated when these actions annihilate their agent
then zeus, to make the fight for his dear son more difficult, spread ominous darkness over that fierce battle
right at the outer gate, with helmet on,
her sisters quickly plunged under the waves
just as a man longs for supper, when all day long a pair of wine-dark oxen pull a well-made plough
to bring about your reconciliation,a dowry bigger than any man so farhas ever handed over with his daughter
in fact, i would have run off long ago
were handling and inspecting it, haggling
at this point,we need to think with prudence
to use the long ladder to come down again
long-suffering lord odysseus answered him and said:
he drew back his long-shadowed spear, then hurled it unerringly
no, it's better to clash in battle right away
she burst out crying, rushed straight up to him, while there gathered round them other female servants of stout-hearted odysseus
with these words, she led headstrong ares from the battle,then sat him down by scamander river bank
when agamemnon saw dark blood flowing from the wound,
and reached the island of thrinacia
from this perfect primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended
and set it in the blazing fire to harden
were eating in the hut, with the other men as well
run into trouble they have brought on themselves
he would set before him
he urged hector, swift ares' equal, to challenge menelaus
if alexander slays menelaus, let him keep helen, all her property
odysseus' dear son jumped up out of bed and dressed
is she still living in the palace halls,
it was my longing for you,
far behind, prayers carry on their healing
in age i can claim to be his senior
so come on now,
encouraged, the wise prophet then declared:
old horseman peleus will not be welcoming me at my returnback to his home, nor will my mother thetis
in all quarters of the old world (setting aside here the newer worlds), from rome to babylon, we can confirm the existence of dionysian celebrations, of a type, at best, related to the greeks in much the same way as the bearded satyr whose name and characteristics are taken from the goat is related to dionysus himself
and perhaps several people remember, like me, amid the dangers and terrors of a dream successfully cheering themselves up by shouting: it is a dream!
and let that expert archer teucer come with him
then he took a massive fleece from a well-fed goat and grabbed a pointed spear
and hateful eriphyle, too, who sold
they all shouted speeches at me
then none of those many danaans there could claim the ends of the line are the most vulnerable
a god dried up the place
the land and forests
glorious odysseus, for your loving care,
brought me here by force
that said, telamonian ajax left
mighty son of atreus, why urge me on?
would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture, having trained himself for what is serious and frightening, to desire a new art, an art of metaphysical consolation, tragedy as his own personal helen of troy, and to have to cry out with faust:
into the middle of the crowd he then brought out the loser's prize, a woman skilled in every kind of work, worth four oxen
the man running off in front was a brave warrior, but the man going after him was greater
when i recall odysseus and think of him,
now we are brawling over beggars
around it poplars grow
apollo was so enraged at niobe,with his silver bow he killed the sons
this feature naturally destroys its nature completely, no matter how much aristotle approved of this arrangement of the chorus
looking like an old and miserable beggar,
with his fine comrades and many treasures
so he can wrap the heifer's horns with gold
where do i go, dear lad?
and yet another man can be so beautiful,
he came up to menelaus
i want to grieve
some fast ship, so all men will be amazed
menelaus, expert at war cries, then replied:
men closed their ranks around him, leaning their shields against their shoulders with their spears extended
woman, be happy about making love
or else her mind had changed
for helios hyperion we will build
in fact, i want her more than clytaemnestra, the wife i married
do as you wish
to begrudge what someone else may get
that makes things difficult, even for a man skilled in speaking
in dionysian art and in its tragic symbolism this same nature speaks to us with its true, undisguised voice: be as i am!
the women all wailed with her
would strike telemachus in his own house
of other things more pitiful than these
who are you among men?
because our fathers were good friends, as well,
around him were assembled shades of all those who would been killed with him and met their fate in aegisthus' house
will rule our home and slaves, battle spoils
of his ancestral house from years ago,
i will also send iris to great-hearted priam, telling him to go to the achaean ships,to beg for his dear son, bearing presentsfor achilles to delight his heart
all sorts of things—like traveling to the towns
when i would finished speaking, teiresias quickly gave me his reply:
prepare a meal as soon as possible
men are gathering up and treading other grapes
of what those suitors were scheming in their hearts
confused, our eyes look after what has disappeared; for what they see has been raised as from a depression into golden light, so full and green, so amply alive, immeasurable and full of yearning
and a crew prepared to take odysseus
flayed from a creature nine years old,
or from a stone
saying this, patroclus led off, and meriones, that godlike man, went too
he shot an arrow  and hit him on his sculpted body armour,in the right shoulder
athena dragged the fast ship down into the sea and stocked it with supplies, all the materials
mighty agamemnon's spear struck against his shield, but the shield could not hold out—the bronze went through,piercing deïcoön's belt and sinking in his gut
medon was a bastard son of noble oïleus and ajax's brother
to be held back here
drank some honey wine, then handed the cup back
eurymachus, if you gave me all the goods you got from your own fathers,
and were carried in the waves, like cormorants,
they might gain a breathing space, something rarein warfare
but the goddess with the gleaming eyes, athena,
and spoke to him, saying:
he will earn you an enormous sum of money,
encourage all your men
our bed, which no one else has ever seen,
saw him, shook his head, then spoke to his own heart:
this land of ithaca, goes to my mistress
the most painful figure of the greek stage, the unlucky oedipus, is understood by sophocles as the noble man who is destined for error and misery in spite of his wisdom, but who at the end through his immense suffering exerts a beneficial effect around him which is effective on those different from him
with its brass floors and high-pitched roof, i think you won’t leave here and go back disappointed,
after this whole courtship, i hope they never
amphiaraus, a man who could rouse people up,
grant that we two come back to the ships covered in glory, after doing something great,something the trojans will regret
let no sceptred king ever be considerate
just as pandareus' daughter,
then antinous addressed them both with this reproach:
but no fear gripped idomeneus, as if he were some pampered child
eager to slaughter us in war, even so,
the rock face rises sheer, the water there
but if agamemnon, son of atreus,or all achaeans learn that you are here,those sons you have left behind will have to paya ransom three times greater for your life
priam, lying at achilles' feet, wept aloudfor man-killing hector, and achilles also wept for his own father and once more for patroclus
not at all—many men have heard of it,
will take away from many excellent men
to the right—an eagle clutching in its talons
standing right beside her, swift-footed iris spoke:
who would match him as a gentle master,
grant that odysseus, sacker of cities,
thus the pair of them continued arguing
then hector of the shining helmet answered her:
behind the mules and wagon
for wise odysseus' return to his own home
and that's why now
mighty son of atreus, agamemnon,ruler of men, it would be far better to worry about all this some other time, when there's a let up in the fight, when the hearthere in my chest is less enraged
the sharp bronze pressed on through the other side,  coming out his forehead
when i was as far from land as a man's voice
but if your heart still resentsatreus' son and his gifts, then take pityon all achaeans, our exhausted soldiers
opened after loosening the lid
of bronze and gold and rich supplies of clothing
in every one two warriors bit the dust, slain by my spear
bright-eyed athena met him—she was disguised
if you are one of the immortal godscome down from heaven, i wo not fight you
to escape in his black ship
but he did not care for my sacrifice
to sleep, and there's a time to take delight
we would come to the well-built home of peleus, mustering men across fertile achaea
their father's sheep and bent-horned cattle
the next i saw was oedipus' mother,
a shepherd to his people, caeneus, exadios, god-like polyphemus,theseus, son of aegeus, all god-like men—the mightiest earthborn men, the strongest
let's rouse the powerful fighting spiritof horse-taming hector, so he challengesone of the danaans to fight him alone,in a grim single combat, one on one
you claim he was destroyed
and so he quickly ran away and then moved across
there i saw high-born tyro first of all, daughter, she said, of noble samoneus,
the people here are not fond of strangers—
i am surprised at that—at dawn yesterday
and i will guide you to men's cities there
she stood close by the famous earthshaker and said:
by those destructive winds
but he failed to reach old age—
do not wake her up
you dogs, because you thought i would not come back from troy to my own home,
all achaeans were then gripped with anxious expectation
when i picked the finest troops for ambush
and now the son i love
and ca not you now rouse yourself to save him,though he's a corpse, for his wife, his mother,and his child to look at, and for priam, too,his father, and the people, who would burn himwith all speed and give him burial rites?
his words had wings:
irus will soon be in trouble, something he brought on himself—he wo not be
great-hearted son of peleus, why ask memy lineage?
to themyou were great glory when you were alive
the men who ate the food this land produced
the noblest form of that other form of greek serenity, the alexandrian, is the cheerfulness of the theoretical man
there is a river minyeïus, which meets the sea near arene
peisistratus, will you promise to do something for me,
so i can give you your gift as my guest,
the spirit had departed, going underground like vapour, muttering faintly
god gives poetic power to your song
my own heart and spirit are urging me,in a strange and fearful way, to go there,to the ships and wide achaean camp
so now i think argives and trojans should part company,since you have suffered many hardships,thanks to the fight between myself and paris, a fight that he began
then raise a massive mountain round their town
so the two best fighters, achilles and the greater ajax, are encamped there
for i say to you, and this will happen,because of agamemnon's arrogance some day gifts three times greater than this girlwill be set down before you
once he sets off in his hollow ship, roaming
so many cattle and fat sheep and drained from jars so much wine
he needed me thereto protect him from destruction
all the men of ithaca will soon come here
but he's a crafty one
he did and ordered us to carve our way
stout-hearted epeians saw the man go down, leader of their horsemen, their best fighting man
you must stay here
we two, pallas athena and myself, have often sworn among immortalsnot to rescue trojans from wretched death,not even when all troy is being engulfedin all-consuming, blazing fire, set offby achaea's warrior sons
most of the day
roused them all to laugh with no sense of control
then he set on the shield a herd of straight-horned cattle, with cows crafted out of gold and tin
he lost his loyal friends on the wine-dark sea and his hollow ship,
and do not ever think about gods' anger
let him in his heart
terrifying screams, as they went at each other
my friends, how far east or west we are
as odysseus said this, they listened eagerly and then obeyed his words
were always in a group
is what they finally did, for it was their fate
from far away has visited my house
full of furious passion, they went at danaans,
he climbed into the chariot
my friend, son of capaneus, come on,get down from the chariot, so you can pullthis sharp arrow from my shoulder for me
six from every ship were killed
like horn or iron, and he kept up his deceit
just as thundering ocean surf crashes on the sand,wave after wave, driven by the west wind's power,one wave rising at sea, then booming down on shore, arching in crests and crashing down among the rocks,spewing salt foam, so then danaan ranks,row after row, moved out, spirits firmly set on war
tell me of noble odysseus' mother
the bronze on achilles' chest glittered like that star,  as he ran forward
then he removed the wondrous mist over achilles' eyes
because i did not welcome you this way
he held a golden cup, poured gleaming wine, libations, on the flaming sacrifice
athena then spoke out winged words of triumph:
or a stronger bond than when man and wife
when loaded down with wine
with a clatter of hooves, the mules moved quickly off, carrying the clothing and the girl, not by herself, for her attendants went with her as well
to get back to your own dear native land
after saying this, he went on board the ship,
had gone there to collect a debt the people owed—
he sailed for ten days on the water, then for seven more,
please rouse yourself to help me return home,
zeus himself addressed them
one man struck the door post of the well-built hall
to view in isolation from the rest
as athena spoke, white-armed goddess hera smiled
against me, blocked my route, and shook the sea in an amazing way
going in close,he took his stand
close to the fields, in reithron's harbour,
his mother went into the house, calling her attendants, who brought together the matrons from the city
laden with bread and meat, as the steward
i do not see you as someone with much skill in competition—
hang on, my heart
take off these clothes,
once, when i was eager to assist you, zeus seized me by the feet and threw me out,down from heaven's heights
the opposite of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to smash the mythical works that surround it
when he returns to his dear native land
but now i am dead
i will tell you something—and this will happen—
the world is at every moment the attained manifestation of god, as the eternally changing, eternally new vision of the person who suffers most, who is the most rent with contradictions, the one with the richest sense of protest, who knows how to save himself only in illusion
behind such a way of thinking and evaluating, which must be hostile to art, so long as it is in any way consistent, i always perceived also a hostility to life, the wrathful, vengeful aversion to life itself
they came to the ships and huts of the myrmidons
this titanic impulse to become something like the atlas of all individuals and to bear them on one's wide back, higher and higher, further and further, is the common link between the promethean and the dionysian
he would made the glittering shield for ajax from the hides of seven well-fed bulls
until the breaking seas had loosened off
so these two talked to one another, as they stood in the house of hades, deep beneath the earth
had had enough of crying and mourning,
any other injury against you
of the phaeacians, who by their descent
we were over there in troy,
my friends, you who believe in dionysian music, you also know what tragedy means to us
that you will kill a cow or sheep
and did so truthfully—i will not hide from you
on her golden throne, the lovely goddess
what cruel god has been attacking you?
his twelve children live there in the palace,
can tell his friends how much we excel
you can do me harm, destroy my manhood
if we know everything which is going to happen, who will want to sit around waiting to see that it really does happen?
mock you here, all of them
now, melanthius, you can really keep watch all night long,
prayers are the daughters of almighty zeus
with this staff as his support, agamemnon spoke:
his companions skinned it, then prepared the meat, slicing it skillfully and putting it on spits
menelaus then drew back his long-shadowed spear, and hurled it
and their dear delicate children to our ships,when we have destroyed their city
with this, the ethical basis of pessimistic tragedy is established together with the justification of human evil, that is, human guilt as the penalty for that sin
after the attending women had washed both men,
so xanthus cried out, calling to the god:
above her head, it spoke to her, saying:
at that point, their quarrelmight have got much worse, but achilles himself  stood up and said:
he's that stranger all the men dishonoured
since the time he left, when i was still a child, no one's looked after them, and smoky fires
but it's impossibleto deal with you, achilles
the bird came close to them, then veered off to the right before the horses
trojans held their spears up high, then turned to face achaeans
and zeus' child, poseidon did not kill me
to telemachus—his words had wings:
every item he would been asked to mention to her,
polydamas, keep all the best men here
this man will take you home
whoever's willing will give me something
we glad of that,
just as in autumn north wind sweeps the thistle down along the plain, and the tufts bunch up together, that how the winds then drove his raft to and fro across the sea
all right, then, do that
thanks to my plans and what i had in mind
when we saw charybdis, we were afraid we would be destroyed
in a black ship over to king echetus,
had ordered him to say
peisistratus, leader of men, stepped up
with this rod in hand, mighty hermes flew away
they told him to bathe there in the flowing river, but lord odysseus said to the attendants:
i could make trojans and danaans hate you, too
telemachus spoke, and everyone endorsed his words
she set up torches and pulled the work apart
what's happened to our sworn oaths, when we claimedwe were the best, the bravest?
they left the two men there, for their fighting days were done, and charged to battle, creating havoc
let's kill the enemy instead
with this idea we think we have, for the first time, reached a true understanding of the original and astonishing meaning of the chorus
with some assertive speech in front of you,
even sun god helioswill not see the two of us, and his rays
those illuminated illusory pictures of the sophoclean heroes are the reverse of that: briefly put, the apollonian of the mask, necessary creations of a glimpse into the inner terror of nature, are like bright spots to heal us from the horrifying night of the disabled gaze
why are you going like this to the ships alone,away from your army in the dead of night,when other warriors are fast asleep?
since he became a roaming wanderer
show me the town
with the remaining ships, which followed me
hector of the shining helmet, still weak, replied:
to which i have come—while you are present here
his skin grew dark once more, his countenance filled out,
so no one robs you on your journey,
he's already done great harm
the third one mixed deliciously sweet wine
and assigned a house
at priam's words, his wife cried out
now's not the time
but in some place far away odysseus
turn even someone really sensible
which you are giving me
felt great joy, happy to learn of his ancestral lands from what pallas athena said, daughter of zeus,
to cheer me up or secure my favour
then the breath of north wind boreas
in their distress they spoke winged words to me:
since you are the younger one,you must begin
when the two men had approached each other, standing at close range, menelaus threw but missed—  his spear point was deflected
our women, too, who wore their girdles low
fine men, who fight in the lycians' front ranks
once she would finished saying the oath, they both set off, wrapping themselves in mist
after athena spoke, she poured sleep on his eyelids
the two ajaxes, attendants of the war god ares,  were willing, meriones, too
as odysseus said these words, a black cloud of grief swallowed up laertes
back to his native land in empty ships,abandoning courageous menelaus
listen now to me
and, lady, that's how i am amazed at you, lost in wonder,
three of his fellows had gone off, herding pigs in different directions
though you will have trouble
just as a strong man with a sharp axe strikes a farm ox right behind its horns,  slicing clean through sinews, so the ox stumbles forward and falls down—that's how aretus jerked forward and then fell onto his back
old man, divinely bred, i ca not sit down
if indeed you are his son
of all of them
you are a disgrace, good only for display
over there, close to him, ask him questions?
it was an omen
the extraordinary courage and wisdom of kant and schopenhauer have succeeded in gaining the most difficult victory, the victory over the optimism concealed in the essence of logic--an optimism that is the basis of our culture
so he will take pity and not ring our city
meriones was the first to speak:
they give splendid presents and do not consume
as quickly as you can urge menelaus,
there were never any waves, large or small
will protect you from all suitors' insults
and all the roads grew dark
stranger, you have been speaking as a friend,
its revelation, being like a parable, seemed to summon us to teat the veil and to uncover the mysterious background; but at the same time this all-illuminated total visibility cast a spell over the eyes and prevented them from penetrating deeper
always to offer nasty provocation,
as soon as dawn arrives,
then, with a terrifying shout, achilles charged, lusting to kill
make sure you act with care—
those who flee help no one, and they get no glory
felt too much pain
by what sap is this parasitic opera nourished, if not by that of true art?
i know what you are saying—i understand
i did not have a large supply of food,
with his bronze spear odysseus killed pidytes from percote
dear wife, what sort of crimes have priamor priam's children committed against you, that you should be so vehemently keento destroy that well-built city ilion?
from all his boars
he would stand far off and shoot an arrow through them
they did not think he would killed the man on purpose
he is my guest,
in the fragrance waves'
your bride can wear it on her wedding day,
then let the wide earth open up for me
but while i was moving through the sacred groves on my way to circe's home, a goddess
she rubbed me with rich oil, then dressed me
so they could not move their limbs or lift their bodies
you have explained this well, exploring all these matters very fairly
with his own wits, unless some god himself
the ones who serve them
astonished, he recognized that all these famous people had no correct and clear insight into their occupations and carried out their work instinctually
other trojans, both men and horses,are being driven back in great confusion,routed by ajax, son of telamon
then, with athena going on board ahead of him,
they quickly rounded up the finest beasts
now he's come and killed our finest men by far
halls, corridors, and courtyards were full of people gathering—a massive crowd,
both sleep and food, for of all achaeans
i carried riches back
a massive ring of mountains round our city
you have got a shovel used for winnowing
