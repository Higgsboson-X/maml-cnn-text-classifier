she went in there, then closed the shining doors
from four fountains, close to each other in a row, clear water flowed in various directions,
or think about his fate
and so i died
you men should be ashamed
for hector and aeneas, troy's best men
and then himself climbed in the ocean-going boat
eumaeus, by telling me these things,
even fair-haired niobe remembered food,with twelve of her own children murdered in her home,her six young daughters and her six strong sons
which a craftsman had once planed with skill
who started all this business, not because
by myself and then rub on the olive oil
always asking questions about everything—
my friends, is there some man confident enoughof his own daring spirit to venture outamong stout-hearted trojans, to seeif he can trap an enemy soldier,some straggler, or catch wind of some reportof what the trojans say among themselves,whether they are keen to stay beside the ships,away from home, or to go back to the city,now that they have beaten the achaeans?
around him, his close companions were all busy, in a hurry to get their morning meal prepared
and get all the women in the house to come
who, as they grieve around me, drain my heart, whenever you are not among us
and bright red wine
on the broad back of the sea
and if a man is harsh
escorting mortal men when any man
what form of drama remained, if it was not to be born from the womb of music, in that mysterious half-light of the dionysian?
what each man's destiny will be or not,
that fair-haired artemis would strike at me,
only very few of them are better
be the sort of men who would defend him?
as we recall them
the swineherd will bring me to the city
should welcome any guest in front of him
standing by the altar, prayed to lord poseidon
o my friend, that day menoetius sent you from phthia in agamemnon's cause, he gave you orders
get up now, stranger, and go to the city
oh, how far from me then was just this entire doctrine of resignation!—
to see if you did, in fact, entertain
he slew imbrius, a spearman, son of mentor, who owned many horses
so now, daughter of zeus, tell us his story, starting anywhere you wish
handed it to the wise old woman, who smoothed it out, and folded it, then hung the tunic on a peg
on those murderers of our sons and brothers
the spear struck amphion, son of selagus,who owned much property in paesus, with many crops
both good and bad—i know what's going on
i am finished with you
aided by malicious sleep, have injured me
through that, such an strange idiosyncratic glimpse into the hellenic was granted to me that it had to appear to me as if our classical-hellenistic scholarship (which is so proud of itself) had up to this point known, for the most part, only how to gloat over games with shadows and trivialities
goddess athena with the gleaming eyes replied to zeus:
in aeschylus we acknowledge the union of the frightened zeus, worried about the end of his power, with the titan
calling out to them:
lycaon's fine son saw diomedes moving fastalong the plain, pushing trojan ranks in front of him, in complete disorder
he has, first of all, as a dionysian artist, become entirely one with the primordial oneness of his pain and contradictory nature and produces the reflection of this primordial oneness as music, if music can with justice be called a re-working of the world, its second coat
and weeping, the old man of the sea
from the doors, since i am here by myself
they leapt up to get armour on
but we will not be going back to our estates
they set torches in between,
will say it is a wedding
gleaming-eyed athena said these words and left,
who's been gone so long
what fools you are, you strangers, or else you come from somewhere far away—
i do not care at all if this annoys you
telemachus to speak about his father,
when she’d recovered and her spirit had returned, she started her lament
the gold one stopped that ash spear from aeneas
teucer, son of telamon, master of your people,my dear comrade, keep on shooting as you are doing
with his sons and sons-in-law, to his lovely home
that woman, more than anyone, has covered herself
which seemed to him the finest place to go onshore
with one hand, lycaon grabbed achilles' knee
he cut down twenty trees,
so i gave him a cunning answer:
amphimedon, what have you suffered,
so from your chariots take out of harnessthose horses with their lovely manes, feed them,then quickly bring here from the citycattle and stout sheep
now lies dead—i mean antinous, the one
seduced by his own force and power,
will certainly see to it you acquire
after i would said this, he stretched out his hands to starry heaven
with these words, odysseus pulled socus' strong spear out of his flesh and removed it from his shield
and make things difficult, or odysseus
some god's just told me—he came and stood beside me—that even now
he took the food in his two hands and set it down right there at his feet, on his tattered bag, and ate, while the minstrel sang his song throughout the hall
his dear nurse eurycleia
but i do not think there's one
stand witness, and wide heaven above,
how can i handle those shameful suitors,
get going, you two
with impunity, but he stopped by antinous,
and zeus' child, what a bold man you are!
in all sorts of ways—a courageous warrior,
swift-footed achilles rose to speak:
and i would not miss my parents or my home,
in spite of all their literature on dreams and numerous dream anecdotes, we can speak of the dreams of the greeks only hypothetically, although with fair certainty
so now the god made manifest talks and acts in such a way that he looks like an erring, striving, suffering individual
as soon as you have escaped the dark blue sea
he would laid no hand on his fast, black, well-decked ship
would you support the suitors or odysseus?
for me, if the gods keep me safe and i get home,peleus himself will find me a wife
for as danaans fought, they shed their own blood also
i learned of this
we made it home—
she was the only god present at this battle
so let's think now
whom he included with the animals
as hector spoke, death's final end slid over him
nausicaa gazed at him in admiration,
that we ca not string his bow, it's a disgrace
you wo not want to acquaint yourself with work
listen to me, trojans, dardanians, allies—victory clearly falls to war-loving menelaus
with many noble riches, to collapse
a skilful speaker full of ancient wisdom,
lie there, son of otrynteus, of all menthe one we fear the most
athena, daughter of aegis-bearing zeus, cried out—
mother, do not encourage me to grieve,
and observed what happens, then let him woo
but there are no wide plains in ithaca,
concerning the process just described, however, we may still say with equal assurance that it is merely a glorious appearance, namely, the aforementioned apollinian illusion whose influence aims to deliver us from the dionysian flood and excess
she spoke to him—her words had wings:
sons of atreus: these are, of course, menelaus and agamemnon, for whose sake many achaean kings joined the expedition to troy, because of a promise they had made to menelaus to help him recover his wife, helen
lying on the portico, resting in their beds,
glorious menelaus, everything you sayis true enough
he feels the actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more elated when these actions annihilate their agent
then zeus, to make the fight for his dear son more difficult, spread ominous darkness over that fierce battle
right at the outer gate, with helmet on,
her sisters quickly plunged under the waves
just as a man longs for supper, when all day long a pair of wine-dark oxen pull a well-made plough
to bring about your reconciliation,a dowry bigger than any man so farhas ever handed over with his daughter
in fact, i would have run off long ago
were handling and inspecting it, haggling
at this point,we need to think with prudence
to use the long ladder to come down again
long-suffering lord odysseus answered him and said:
he drew back his long-shadowed spear, then hurled it unerringly
no, it's better to clash in battle right away
she burst out crying, rushed straight up to him, while there gathered round them other female servants of stout-hearted odysseus
with these words, she led headstrong ares from the battle,then sat him down by scamander river bank
when agamemnon saw dark blood flowing from the wound,
and reached the island of thrinacia
from this perfect primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended
and set it in the blazing fire to harden
were eating in the hut, with the other men as well
run into trouble they have brought on themselves
he would set before him
he urged hector, swift ares' equal, to challenge menelaus
if alexander slays menelaus, let him keep helen, all her property
odysseus' dear son jumped up out of bed and dressed
is she still living in the palace halls,
it was my longing for you,
far behind, prayers carry on their healing
in age i can claim to be his senior
so come on now,
encouraged, the wise prophet then declared:
old horseman peleus will not be welcoming me at my returnback to his home, nor will my mother thetis
in all quarters of the old world (setting aside here the newer worlds), from rome to babylon, we can confirm the existence of dionysian celebrations, of a type, at best, related to the greeks in much the same way as the bearded satyr whose name and characteristics are taken from the goat is related to dionysus himself
and perhaps several people remember, like me, amid the dangers and terrors of a dream successfully cheering themselves up by shouting: it is a dream!
and let that expert archer teucer come with him
then he took a massive fleece from a well-fed goat and grabbed a pointed spear
and hateful eriphyle, too, who sold
they all shouted speeches at me
then none of those many danaans there could claim the ends of the line are the most vulnerable
a god dried up the place
the land and forests
glorious odysseus, for your loving care,
brought me here by force
that said, telamonian ajax left
mighty son of atreus, why urge me on?
would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture, having trained himself for what is serious and frightening, to desire a new art, an art of metaphysical consolation, tragedy as his own personal helen of troy, and to have to cry out with faust:
into the middle of the crowd he then brought out the loser's prize, a woman skilled in every kind of work, worth four oxen
the man running off in front was a brave warrior, but the man going after him was greater
when i recall odysseus and think of him,
now we are brawling over beggars
around it poplars grow
apollo was so enraged at niobe,with his silver bow he killed the sons
this feature naturally destroys its nature completely, no matter how much aristotle approved of this arrangement of the chorus
looking like an old and miserable beggar,
with his fine comrades and many treasures
so he can wrap the heifer's horns with gold
where do i go, dear lad?
and yet another man can be so beautiful,
he came up to menelaus
i want to grieve
some fast ship, so all men will be amazed
menelaus, expert at war cries, then replied:
men closed their ranks around him, leaning their shields against their shoulders with their spears extended
woman, be happy about making love
or else her mind had changed
for helios hyperion we will build
in fact, i want her more than clytaemnestra, the wife i married
do as you wish
to begrudge what someone else may get
that makes things difficult, even for a man skilled in speaking
in dionysian art and in its tragic symbolism this same nature speaks to us with its true, undisguised voice: be as i am!
the women all wailed with her
would strike telemachus in his own house
of other things more pitiful than these
who are you among men?
because our fathers were good friends, as well,
around him were assembled shades of all those who would been killed with him and met their fate in aegisthus' house
will rule our home and slaves, battle spoils
of his ancestral house from years ago,
i will also send iris to great-hearted priam, telling him to go to the achaean ships,to beg for his dear son, bearing presentsfor achilles to delight his heart
all sorts of things—like traveling to the towns
when i would finished speaking, teiresias quickly gave me his reply:
prepare a meal as soon as possible
men are gathering up and treading other grapes
of what those suitors were scheming in their hearts
confused, our eyes look after what has disappeared; for what they see has been raised as from a depression into golden light, so full and green, so amply alive, immeasurable and full of yearning
and a crew prepared to take odysseus
flayed from a creature nine years old,
or from a stone
saying this, patroclus led off, and meriones, that godlike man, went too
he shot an arrow  and hit him on his sculpted body armour,in the right shoulder
athena dragged the fast ship down into the sea and stocked it with supplies, all the materials
mighty agamemnon's spear struck against his shield, but the shield could not hold out—the bronze went through,piercing deïcoön's belt and sinking in his gut
medon was a bastard son of noble oïleus and ajax's brother
to be held back here
drank some honey wine, then handed the cup back
eurymachus, if you gave me all the goods you got from your own fathers,
and were carried in the waves, like cormorants,
they might gain a breathing space, something rarein warfare
but the goddess with the gleaming eyes, athena,
and spoke to him, saying:
he will earn you an enormous sum of money,
encourage all your men
our bed, which no one else has ever seen,
saw him, shook his head, then spoke to his own heart:
this land of ithaca, goes to my mistress
the most painful figure of the greek stage, the unlucky oedipus, is understood by sophocles as the noble man who is destined for error and misery in spite of his wisdom, but who at the end through his immense suffering exerts a beneficial effect around him which is effective on those different from him
with its brass floors and high-pitched roof, i think you won’t leave here and go back disappointed,
after this whole courtship, i hope they never
amphiaraus, a man who could rouse people up,
grant that we two come back to the ships covered in glory, after doing something great,something the trojans will regret
let no sceptred king ever be considerate
just as pandareus' daughter,
then antinous addressed them both with this reproach:
but no fear gripped idomeneus, as if he were some pampered child
eager to slaughter us in war, even so,
the rock face rises sheer, the water there
but if agamemnon, son of atreus,or all achaeans learn that you are here,those sons you have left behind will have to paya ransom three times greater for your life
priam, lying at achilles' feet, wept aloudfor man-killing hector, and achilles also wept for his own father and once more for patroclus
not at all—many men have heard of it,
will take away from many excellent men
to the right—an eagle clutching in its talons
standing right beside her, swift-footed iris spoke:
who would match him as a gentle master,
grant that odysseus, sacker of cities,
thus the pair of them continued arguing
then hector of the shining helmet answered her:
behind the mules and wagon
for wise odysseus' return to his own home
and that's why now
mighty son of atreus, agamemnon,ruler of men, it would be far better to worry about all this some other time, when there's a let up in the fight, when the hearthere in my chest is less enraged
the sharp bronze pressed on through the other side,  coming out his forehead
when i was as far from land as a man's voice
but if your heart still resentsatreus' son and his gifts, then take pityon all achaeans, our exhausted soldiers
opened after loosening the lid
of bronze and gold and rich supplies of clothing
in every one two warriors bit the dust, slain by my spear
bright-eyed athena met him—she was disguised
if you are one of the immortal godscome down from heaven, i wo not fight you
to escape in his black ship
but he did not care for my sacrifice
to sleep, and there's a time to take delight
we would come to the well-built home of peleus, mustering men across fertile achaea
their father's sheep and bent-horned cattle
the next i saw was oedipus' mother,
a shepherd to his people, caeneus, exadios, god-like polyphemus,theseus, son of aegeus, all god-like men—the mightiest earthborn men, the strongest
let's rouse the powerful fighting spiritof horse-taming hector, so he challengesone of the danaans to fight him alone,in a grim single combat, one on one
you claim he was destroyed
and so he quickly ran away and then moved across
there i saw high-born tyro first of all, daughter, she said, of noble samoneus,
the people here are not fond of strangers—
i am surprised at that—at dawn yesterday
and i will guide you to men's cities there
she stood close by the famous earthshaker and said:
by those destructive winds
but he failed to reach old age—
do not wake her up
you dogs, because you thought i would not come back from troy to my own home,
all achaeans were then gripped with anxious expectation
when i picked the finest troops for ambush
and now the son i love
and ca not you now rouse yourself to save him,though he's a corpse, for his wife, his mother,and his child to look at, and for priam, too,his father, and the people, who would burn himwith all speed and give him burial rites?
his words had wings:
irus will soon be in trouble, something he brought on himself—he wo not be
great-hearted son of peleus, why ask memy lineage?
to themyou were great glory when you were alive
the men who ate the food this land produced
the noblest form of that other form of greek serenity, the alexandrian, is the cheerfulness of the theoretical man
there is a river minyeïus, which meets the sea near arene
peisistratus, will you promise to do something for me,
so i can give you your gift as my guest,
the spirit had departed, going underground like vapour, muttering faintly
god gives poetic power to your song
my own heart and spirit are urging me,in a strange and fearful way, to go there,to the ships and wide achaean camp
so now i think argives and trojans should part company,since you have suffered many hardships,thanks to the fight between myself and paris, a fight that he began
then raise a massive mountain round their town
so the two best fighters, achilles and the greater ajax, are encamped there
for i say to you, and this will happen,because of agamemnon's arrogance some day gifts three times greater than this girlwill be set down before you
once he sets off in his hollow ship, roaming
so many cattle and fat sheep and drained from jars so much wine
he needed me thereto protect him from destruction
all the men of ithaca will soon come here
but he's a crafty one
he did and ordered us to carve our way
stout-hearted epeians saw the man go down, leader of their horsemen, their best fighting man
you must stay here
we two, pallas athena and myself, have often sworn among immortalsnot to rescue trojans from wretched death,not even when all troy is being engulfedin all-consuming, blazing fire, set offby achaea's warrior sons
most of the day
roused them all to laugh with no sense of control
then he set on the shield a herd of straight-horned cattle, with cows crafted out of gold and tin
he lost his loyal friends on the wine-dark sea and his hollow ship,
and do not ever think about gods' anger
let him in his heart
terrifying screams, as they went at each other
my friends, how far east or west we are
as odysseus said this, they listened eagerly and then obeyed his words
were always in a group
is what they finally did, for it was their fate
from far away has visited my house
full of furious passion, they went at danaans,
he climbed into the chariot
my friend, son of capaneus, come on,get down from the chariot, so you can pullthis sharp arrow from my shoulder for me
six from every ship were killed
like horn or iron, and he kept up his deceit
just as thundering ocean surf crashes on the sand,wave after wave, driven by the west wind's power,one wave rising at sea, then booming down on shore, arching in crests and crashing down among the rocks,spewing salt foam, so then danaan ranks,row after row, moved out, spirits firmly set on war
tell me of noble odysseus' mother
the bronze on achilles' chest glittered like that star,  as he ran forward
then he removed the wondrous mist over achilles' eyes
because i did not welcome you this way
he held a golden cup, poured gleaming wine, libations, on the flaming sacrifice
athena then spoke out winged words of triumph:
or a stronger bond than when man and wife
when loaded down with wine
with a clatter of hooves, the mules moved quickly off, carrying the clothing and the girl, not by herself, for her attendants went with her as well
to get back to your own dear native land
after saying this, he went on board the ship,
had gone there to collect a debt the people owed—
he sailed for ten days on the water, then for seven more,
please rouse yourself to help me return home,
zeus himself addressed them
one man struck the door post of the well-built hall
to view in isolation from the rest
as athena spoke, white-armed goddess hera smiled
against me, blocked my route, and shook the sea in an amazing way
going in close,he took his stand
close to the fields, in reithron's harbour,
his mother went into the house, calling her attendants, who brought together the matrons from the city
laden with bread and meat, as the steward
i do not see you as someone with much skill in competition—
hang on, my heart
take off these clothes,
once, when i was eager to assist you, zeus seized me by the feet and threw me out,down from heaven's heights
the opposite of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to smash the mythical works that surround it
when he returns to his dear native land
but now i am dead
i will tell you something—and this will happen—
the world is at every moment the attained manifestation of god, as the eternally changing, eternally new vision of the person who suffers most, who is the most rent with contradictions, the one with the richest sense of protest, who knows how to save himself only in illusion
behind such a way of thinking and evaluating, which must be hostile to art, so long as it is in any way consistent, i always perceived also a hostility to life, the wrathful, vengeful aversion to life itself
they came to the ships and huts of the myrmidons
this titanic impulse to become something like the atlas of all individuals and to bear them on one's wide back, higher and higher, further and further, is the common link between the promethean and the dionysian
he would made the glittering shield for ajax from the hides of seven well-fed bulls
until the breaking seas had loosened off
so these two talked to one another, as they stood in the house of hades, deep beneath the earth
had had enough of crying and mourning,
any other injury against you
of the phaeacians, who by their descent
we were over there in troy,
my friends, you who believe in dionysian music, you also know what tragedy means to us
that you will kill a cow or sheep
and did so truthfully—i will not hide from you
on her golden throne, the lovely goddess
what cruel god has been attacking you?
his twelve children live there in the palace,
can tell his friends how much we excel
you can do me harm, destroy my manhood
if we know everything which is going to happen, who will want to sit around waiting to see that it really does happen?
mock you here, all of them
now, melanthius, you can really keep watch all night long,
prayers are the daughters of almighty zeus
with this staff as his support, agamemnon spoke:
his companions skinned it, then prepared the meat, slicing it skillfully and putting it on spits
menelaus then drew back his long-shadowed spear, and hurled it
and their dear delicate children to our ships,when we have destroyed their city
with this, the ethical basis of pessimistic tragedy is established together with the justification of human evil, that is, human guilt as the penalty for that sin
after the attending women had washed both men,
so xanthus cried out, calling to the god:
above her head, it spoke to her, saying:
at that point, their quarrelmight have got much worse, but achilles himself  stood up and said:
he's that stranger all the men dishonoured
since the time he left, when i was still a child, no one's looked after them, and smoky fires
but it's impossibleto deal with you, achilles
the bird came close to them, then veered off to the right before the horses
trojans held their spears up high, then turned to face achaeans
and zeus' child, poseidon did not kill me
to telemachus—his words had wings:
every item he would been asked to mention to her,
polydamas, keep all the best men here
this man will take you home
whoever's willing will give me something
we glad of that,
just as in autumn north wind sweeps the thistle down along the plain, and the tufts bunch up together, that how the winds then drove his raft to and fro across the sea
all right, then, do that
thanks to my plans and what i had in mind
when we saw charybdis, we were afraid we would be destroyed
in a black ship over to king echetus,
had ordered him to say
peisistratus, leader of men, stepped up
with this rod in hand, mighty hermes flew away
they told him to bathe there in the flowing river, but lord odysseus said to the attendants:
i could make trojans and danaans hate you, too
telemachus spoke, and everyone endorsed his words
she set up torches and pulled the work apart
what's happened to our sworn oaths, when we claimedwe were the best, the bravest?
they left the two men there, for their fighting days were done, and charged to battle, creating havoc
let's kill the enemy instead
with this idea we think we have, for the first time, reached a true understanding of the original and astonishing meaning of the chorus
with some assertive speech in front of you,
even sun god helioswill not see the two of us, and his rays
those illuminated illusory pictures of the sophoclean heroes are the reverse of that: briefly put, the apollonian of the mask, necessary creations of a glimpse into the inner terror of nature, are like bright spots to heal us from the horrifying night of the disabled gaze
why are you going like this to the ships alone,away from your army in the dead of night,when other warriors are fast asleep?
since he became a roaming wanderer
show me the town
with the remaining ships, which followed me
hector of the shining helmet, still weak, replied:
to which i have come—while you are present here
his skin grew dark once more, his countenance filled out,
so no one robs you on your journey,
he's already done great harm
the third one mixed deliciously sweet wine
and assigned a house
at priam's words, his wife cried out
now's not the time
but in some place far away odysseus
turn even someone really sensible
which you are giving me
felt great joy, happy to learn of his ancestral lands from what pallas athena said, daughter of zeus,
to cheer me up or secure my favour
then the breath of north wind boreas
in their distress they spoke winged words to me:
since you are the younger one,you must begin
when the two men had approached each other, standing at close range, menelaus threw but missed—  his spear point was deflected
our women, too, who wore their girdles low
fine men, who fight in the lycians' front ranks
once she would finished saying the oath, they both set off, wrapping themselves in mist
after athena spoke, she poured sleep on his eyelids
the two ajaxes, attendants of the war god ares,  were willing, meriones, too
as odysseus said these words, a black cloud of grief swallowed up laertes
back to his native land in empty ships,abandoning courageous menelaus
listen now to me
and, lady, that's how i am amazed at you, lost in wonder,
three of his fellows had gone off, herding pigs in different directions
though you will have trouble
just as a strong man with a sharp axe strikes a farm ox right behind its horns,  slicing clean through sinews, so the ox stumbles forward and falls down—that's how aretus jerked forward and then fell onto his back
old man, divinely bred, i ca not sit down
if indeed you are his son
of all of them
you are a disgrace, good only for display
over there, close to him, ask him questions?
it was an omen
the extraordinary courage and wisdom of kant and schopenhauer have succeeded in gaining the most difficult victory, the victory over the optimism concealed in the essence of logic--an optimism that is the basis of our culture
so he will take pity and not ring our city
meriones was the first to speak:
they give splendid presents and do not consume
as quickly as you can urge menelaus,
there were never any waves, large or small
will protect you from all suitors' insults
and all the roads grew dark
stranger, you have been speaking as a friend,
its revelation, being like a parable, seemed to summon us to teat the veil and to uncover the mysterious background; but at the same time this all-illuminated total visibility cast a spell over the eyes and prevented them from penetrating deeper
always to offer nasty provocation,
as soon as dawn arrives,
then, with a terrifying shout, achilles charged, lusting to kill
make sure you act with care—
those who flee help no one, and they get no glory
felt too much pain
by what sap is this parasitic opera nourished, if not by that of true art?
i know what you are saying—i understand
i did not have a large supply of food,
with his bronze spear odysseus killed pidytes from percote
dear wife, what sort of crimes have priamor priam's children committed against you, that you should be so vehemently keento destroy that well-built city ilion?
from all his boars
he would stand far off and shoot an arrow through them
they did not think he would killed the man on purpose
he is my guest,
in the fragrance waves'
your bride can wear it on her wedding day,
then let the wide earth open up for me
but while i was moving through the sacred groves on my way to circe's home, a goddess
she rubbed me with rich oil, then dressed me
so they could not move their limbs or lift their bodies
you have explained this well, exploring all these matters very fairly
with his own wits, unless some god himself
the ones who serve them
astonished, he recognized that all these famous people had no correct and clear insight into their occupations and carried out their work instinctually
other trojans, both men and horses,are being driven back in great confusion,routed by ajax, son of telamon
then, with athena going on board ahead of him,
they quickly rounded up the finest beasts
now he's come and killed our finest men by far
halls, corridors, and courtyards were full of people gathering—a massive crowd,
both sleep and food, for of all achaeans
i carried riches back
a massive ring of mountains round our city
you have got a shovel used for winnowing
till bright-eyed athena cast sweet sleep on her eyes
may prompt him to?
standing by him, theoclymenus spoke—
the soldiers, like a fire consuming all the land,moved on out
so these men occupied themselves with dinner
when sleep took hold of him and eased his aching heart by sweetly flowing round him—for his splendid limbs were tired out from chasing after hector by wind-swept ilion—then poor patroclus came to him as a ghost, looking exactly like him in all respects—in stature, handsome eyes, and voice
other than his wife and one house steward
on his way back, he did some fearful things,with keen support from you, divine goddess
when every man had eatenas much food and drink as anyone could wish,geranian horseman nestor was the first to speak
they senttheir gods' most important holy priests
once i would appeased the anger of those gods who live forever, i made a funeral mound
as he thought about it, it seem to him a better plan to stand apart
then medon, a shrewd man, spoke out
are not we concerned about them any more, as their evil fate accomplishes its purpose?
that would be wrong
penned in there at night
who has sufficient strength to draw a bow
meanwhile, once his group had eaten their hearts' fill of food as sweet as honey, lord odysseus,
so glaucus spoke in prayer
in between these layers was a piece of felt
scowling at hector, swift-footed achilles then replied:
on your painful wanderings
pheidon, ruler of the thesprotians,
for what you have said is gnawing at my heart—
his soldiers amused themselves beside the breaking sea by throwing spears and discus or with archery
o father zeus, none of the other gods
did not bring to fulfillment
will resent us, once they learn about
or by some trick
or tilled or known the work of human beings
go rule your myrmidons
there's the rocky island asteris
the greeks are, as the egyptian priests say, eternal children, and where tragic art is concerned, only children who do not know what an exalted toy has arisen under their hands, something which will be destroyed
on the strings he plucked the prelude to a lovely song
will be carried out
hector then addressed both sides:
others, the ones they saw clearly moving off, back from the fight, they taunted with abuse
who commands the restless sea
the wife of agamemnon, atreus' son,
when it comes to fighting, we are not ignorant
that curse which gives men all kinds of trouble
the other shadows of the dead and gone
with an infinite supply of tasty food
apollo did not disobey his father
the men were already keen to fight, but they took his words to heart and fenced in the ships within a hedge of bronze
for he, according to the experience of all ages, always says i and sings out the entire chromatic sequence of the sounds of his passions and desires
now there's aegisthus, who took for himself
for we are staring at a great disaster
anything that's appropriate for guests
once he came to mycenaeas a peaceful guest with godlike polyneices, mustering men to assault the sacred walls of thebes
to marry whoever is the finest man
put armour on,and quickly
my friends, we are so amazed prince hectoris such a spearman, so courageous, warlike
then achaeans, who breathe fighting spirit, feared for machaon— they thought he might he captured, should the battle change
from his own friends
but not one of those men he would entertained now stoodin front of him, protecting him from wretched death
their lovely voices answering each other
but winds and waves still carried him ahead
but soon the argives by their ships would have reason to remember him
out of their wagon harnesses, then drove them
i think he might bitterly regret all this,  once our army is destroyed
my fame extends all the way to heaven
if you are being sincere in asking me
it delights my heartthat you think of me always as your friend
child of aegis-bearing zeus, untiring goddess, hear me
they hang around our house, day after day,
when the first growth of hair is on his lip,
two vultures sat there,
through her house, rousing my companions,
repeat in public everything i say, so other achaeans will grow angry,if he, still clothed in shamelessness, hopes at any time to deceive some argive
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared,
meriones went after phereclus as he ran off, hurled his spear straight into his right buttock
was with immortal gods, enjoying their feasts
now agamemnon has even shamed achilles,a much finer warrior than himself, stealing a prize, keeping it for his own use
on the left flank of that destructive battle, hector met paris, husband of fair-haired helen, encouraging his comrades, urging them to fight
moving from the surf where it pounded on the shore, he swam out to sea, but kept looking at the land, hoping to come across a sloping beach somewhere
without saying a word
who keeps him there by force
with these words, hector raised his spear and threw it
in a mortal man who lacks my wisdom
here also we become aware of the victory of appearances over the universal and of the delight in the particular, rather like an anatomical specimen
old man,you are a hard one
then eupeithes' son, antinous, said to them:
and spoke out, saying:
stretching out their arms in my direction,
and speaking morally, something like cowardice and falsehood?
my friends, leaders and rulers of the argives,since gods have granted that this man be killed,who's done much damage, more than all the rest, let's test these trojan by attacking themwith armed excursions round their city,to see what they intend—whether they will leavetheir lofty city now that hector's dead, or stay there, still keen to fight without him
when the noble lady reached the suitors, she stood beside a pillar holding up the well-made roof,
it smashed through his white teeth
my husband—you have lost your life so young,leaving me a widow in our home,with our son still an infant, the childborn to you and me in our wretchedness
those companions you just mentioned have been killed
and wiping the encrusted brine out of his hair
i formed a plan to move up close beside him,
they have understood, and it now disgusts them to act, for their actions can change nothing in the eternal nature of things
we moved across the island quite amazed
when hector did not meet his fair wife in the house,  he went and, standing in the doorway, asked his servant:
i have seen other menwho trusted their strong power and courageand with their numbers held their countryagainst zeus' will
have spun the threads of this
you can assess the plant
may you never meet her when she swallows!
when melanthius the goatherd was coming out
aeneas, counselor to bronze-armed trojans,from all i see, i think that man must bethe warlike son of tydeus
but i shall list the leaders, commanders of the ships, and all the ships in full
once i would plugged my comrades' ears with wax,
who has zeus as witness?
now at last, upon returning to the primitive source of its being, it may venture to stride along boldly and freely before the eyes of all nations without being attached to the lead strings of a romanic civilization; if only it can learn constantly from one people--the greeks, from whom to be able to learn at all itself is a high honor and a rare distinction
are not you content to share a feast with us,
achilles pulled out his sharp sword and struck, hitting him on the collar bone, beside his neck
her name is arete, born of the same line
we can understand why so feeble a culture hates true art; it fears destruction from its hands
the image which now reveals his unity with the heart of the world is a dream scene, which symbolizes that original contradiction and pain, together with the primordial joy in illusion
the spear struck him as he was strutting forward
at last diomedes, skilled at war shouts, cried out:
i do not thinkyou will long escape complete destruction at my hands
for their violent ways
and if the german should hesitantly look around for a leader who might bring him back again into his long lost home whose ways and paths he scarcely knows anymore, let him merely listen to the ecstatically luring call of the dionysian bird that hovers above him and wants to point the way for him
yes, indeed, dear wife, everything you have said
salutes the herdsman moving his beasts out
but when that great voice issued from his chest, with words like winter snowflakes, no man alivecould match odysseus
the arrow had been loosed by alexander,
who recognized him, in spite of his disguise
in peace, and do not compete with younger men
i am the son of apheidas, lord polypemon's son
on their heads the girls had lovely flower garlands
aeacus came from zeus himself, and zeusis stronger than rivers flowing to the sea, so zeus' line is stronger than all thosedescended from a river
when calypso, that lovely goddess, tried
but finally he reached the surface, spitting tart salt water from his mouth, as it streamed down from off his head
oh my child, why did i rear you,
but you are much too proud,
never would come back
but if she keeps on doing this for long,
those are the facts, and i do like to speak the truth
so long-suffering lord odysseus lay down there,
i do not blame you, but agamemnon
but come now, so we may rouse another man,someone who should be there when we discussour plans, whether we should flee or battle on
let's have no more crying
i must keep going
or were you fighting to seize their city and their women?
three times trojans and their allies were thrown into confusion
that's what he said
to strike at me unfairly, and by force
those weapons were the cause earth swallowed up
some were wiping tables down with porous sponges and setting them in place, while others passed around huge amounts of meat
when morning comes, we will go on board, set off on the wide sea
or i will seize himand pitch him into black tartarus, way down,into the deepest pit below the earth,where the gates are iron, the threshold bronze,as far below hades as heaven lies above the earth
waving two sharp spears, he roamed through all the army,rousing men to fight, steeling hearts for dreadful war
was true, when she claimed that out at sea,
it is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists of the time combated the old ecclesiastical conception of man as inherently corrupt and lost, with this newly created picture of the paradisiacal artist: so that opera is to be understood as the opposition dogma of the good man, but may also, at the same time, provide a consolation for that pessimism which, owing to the frightful uncertainty of all conditions of life, attracted precisely the serious-minded men of the time
while this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable aeternae veritates [eternal verities
his life was cut short on great ajax's deadly spear
and please your honoured mother and father
i can boast that i am no worse than her
may that never be
but you can hear a man's distress from anywhere
that life really so tragic would least of all explain the origin of an art form--assuming that art is not merely imitation of the reality of nature but rather a metaphysical supplement of the reality of nature, placed beside it for its overcoming
three and four times blessed, who died back then in spacious troy, while doing a favour
other than the two of us, you and me,
once odysseus had clearly seen how firm their minds were, he spoke to them again, saying these words:
one of the phaeacian elders there among them:
we have shared this food, and music has accompanied
wife, i will not disregard what you advise
warm up some water, so he can bathe,
the father of gods and men agreed
by now light was shining on the ground,
once the wine had addled cyclops' wits,
quickly they brought in a male ox, five years old, flayed it, and prepared the beast, slicing up the limbs
tragedy grew up out of this foundation and, for that very reason, has, from its inception, been spared the embarrasing business of counterfeiting reality
where are his horses?
now it's time to get a dinner ready
the battle shouts fill heaven
it was his apollonian insight that, like a barbarian king, he did not understand a divine image and was in danger of sinning against a divinity through his failure to understand
his sons were sitting with their father inside the courtyard, wetting garments with their tears
with loyal servants keeping watch on them
led him to a fatal destiny, the day he met
out of the violet sea, and moved on shore,
the slaughtered sheep, the wine and bread consumed
nausicaa, whose beauty was a gift from god,
for warmth and light
i hope angerlike this rage you are nursing never seizes me
odysseus will not stay away much longer
once the funeral gathering broke up, the men dispersed, each one going to his own ship, concerned to eat and then enjoy sweet sleep
when they would drunk down
lead out great priam to administer the oathin person, for his sons are over-proud, untrustworthy
though it's essential we move really fast
the first to begin the rout was peneleus, a boeotian
with this chorus, the profound greek, capable of the most delicate and the most severe suffering, consoled himself, the man who looked around with a daring gaze in the middle of the terrifying destructive instincts of so-called world history and equally into the cruelty of nature and who is in danger of longing for the denial of the will of buddhism
whipping you in shame from our assembly
these proud suitors telemachus and i
hear me, child of aegis-bearing zeus,
gleaming wine, and cattle for sacrifice,
to be sad all the time and never stop,
called the swineherd to him and, taking a whole loaf from the fine basket and as much meat as he could hold in both his hands, he spoke to him, saying:
i have managed hereto ease somewhat my heart's grief for the deathof menoetius' son, though the man i have killedis a lesser man than he
then his noble heart gave out a mighty groan,
men from aspledon and minyan orchomenus were led by ascalaphus and ialmenus, ares' sons
at cassandra's shout, no man or woman was left unaffected
no man stops zeus' plans,
purged the house and yard completely
by phaeacian noblemen enjoying his song,
in ithaca, and gave him countless gifts—
like a child—you are now too old for that
would not be sweet
attempting to get home, we had to take
i chopped off a piece, six feet in length,
we sat there eating rich supplies of meat
and kindness, as a father for a son
began to blow, and so our ships moved fast
we went inside the cave and looked around
sought her hand in marriage
his wife and noble son
and there i offered a full sacrifice
and prepare a place to sleep—a bed, cloaks,
i have come now from our shipshere to the plain
fleeing from argos because he would killed a man
so you are putting onthe immortal armour of the finest man,who makes other men afraid
i wish it were as certain that i wasthe son of aegis-bearing zeus himself,
he quickly spoke winged words to telemachus,
arrived from their fine ship
i have twenty geese come from the water
created out of merely premature and really immature personal experiences, which lay close to the threshold of something communicable, and built on the basis of art (for the problem of scientific research cannot be understood on the basis of scientific enquiry)—a book perhaps for artists with analytical tendencies and a capacity for retrospection (that means for exceptions, a type of artist whom it is necessary to seek out and whom one never wants to look for), full of psychological innovations and artists' secrets, with an artist's metaphysics in the background, a youthful work full of the spirit of youth and the melancholy of youth, independent, defiantly self-sufficient as well, even where it seemed to bow down with special reverence to an authority—in short, a first work also in the bad sense of the word, afflicted, in spite of the antiquity of the problem, with every fault of youth, above all with its excessive verbiage and its storm and stress
daughter of aegis-bearing zeus, in shape and form looking just like mentor, had both parties swear a solemn treaty designed to last forever
although some dear companions had been killed
the walls and beautiful pedestals,
but as the seasons came and went, the year arrived
through these gates the goddesses led out their horses, hera lashing them ahead
the cicones, and then came to the fertile land
tell me about the number of the suitors,
had quickly called achaeans to assembly,
she found him working with his bellows, moving round,
after that, peleus' son quickly set out other prizesfor the footrace—a finely crafted silver mixing bowl, holding six measures
now, at that moment, feelings between zeus and other immortal gods could have become much harsher, more incensed, if athena, fearing what might happen to the gods, had not jumped from the throne where she would been sitting, rushed out the door, seized ares' helmet from his head,  grabbed the shield from off his shoulders and the spear out of his mighty fist, and thrown them to one side
and let old nestor know what's happening
mother, you are a cruel woman, with an unfeeling heart
innards, flesh, and marrow—leaving nothing
divine charybdis terrified us all,
for a long time he stood in shock, speechless
the dialects they speak
to my own hut and entertaining you!
in fact, if anyoneever spoke rudely to me in the house—one of your brothers or sisters, some brother's well-dressed wife, or your mother—for your fatheralways was so kind, as if he were my own—you would speak out, persuading them to stop,using your gentleness, your soothing words
did you not tell us
with bread and meat and wine
if you gorged yourselves, then someday soon
having said this, queen hera went inside the house, sat on her throne
that's what hermes said, but his fine words did not persuade aegisthus in his heart
then he sprinkled over them
no one's heart went unsatisfied
then he created two splendid cities of mortal men
he may hear of it somewhere—and to gain
on his right shoulder he waved his dreadful spear made of pelian ash
then climbed out through the surf
and agree with what i am going to tell you—
that's what i asked, and he gave me his answer right away:
and eased disturbing worries he had in his heart
for gods and all achaeans understand
of those companions of the son of atreus
the best one for you, and then, when that ship
but come,let's enjoy our love together on the bed
but then the din of war raged round the sturdy wall
they boarded quickly and sat down at their benches
is telling her to ask about her husband
no island sloping down into the sea
this said, the two men pulled on fearful armour
any of his comrades who defend him
constantly disturbing them in their roadside nests— those fools make mischief for all sorts of people
attendants passed these hairsamong the leaders of the trojans and achaeans
the marriage or invent some other scheme
hector did not stay in the well-armed trojan group, but, like an eagle swooping down upon some flock of winged birds feeding by a river bank— wild geese or cranes or long-necked swans—he rushed straight at the dark-prowed ships to take on ajax
acroneus, ocyalus, and elatreus,
those two spectators he honoured as the only judges capable of rendering a verdict and as the masters of all his art
patroclus did the same, standing up as soon as he saw the embassy
once penelope said this, the old woman went through the chamber to instruct the women and urge them to appear
athena went down into the trojan crowd, looking like laodocus, antenor's son, a strong spearman, seeking godlike pandarus
he stood up quickly, looked at trojans and achaeans,saw trojans running off with argives driving themfrom the back, among them god poseidon
some newsfrom phthia that only you have heard?
but to be trapped here,all alone, that could be worse
and can you nownot face menelaus?
poseidon watched odysseus sailing on the sea,
so they could all offer sacrifices
when she would told me this, i replied and said:
let zeus judge between trojans and achaeans, as his heart desires
who loves lightning, for he accompanies
find their delight in different kinds of work
again and again we experience how a beethoven symphony makes it necessary for the individual listener to talk in images, even if it's true that the collection of different worlds of imagery created by a musical piece really looks fantastically confused, even contradictory
where i have twelve mares and sturdy mules
as he came out
that he is dead and gone, then come back here,
my honoured mother answered me at once:
could have a contest working in the spring,
looking round now, i ca not see them here,any of them
my heart fears that man, but i respect himtoo much to rob him, in case something bad comes to me later
then you would quickly learn
though i suspected something, i had to go
first to rise, well before the rest, was agamemnon, king of men
and then, when you have offered prayers of supplication to celebrated nations of the dead,
you sons of priam, that god-nurtured king,why are you still allowing the achaeans to keep slaughtering your troops?
hence, in the song and the lyrical mood, willing (our personal interest in our own purposes) and pure contemplation in the setting which presents itself are miraculously mixed up together
land rich in grass and wheat
but he has perished
past this island and not listened to us,
but some, i think, will not obey him
the point did not pass through, but its momentum knocked sarpedon back in the middle of his charge
where are you rushing off?
seeing him do that,they leapt quickly from their chariots and left them there
just as the mind races in a man who's voyaged to many lands,when in his fertile head he recalls everything, and thinks i wish i were here!
horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans,men who earlier were fighting one anotherin wretched war out there on the plain, both keen for war's destruction, are sitting still
back to his lair and brings to both of them
but we rushed on
the fish have eaten him down in the sea,
you speakin triumph about widowing his wifein her new bridal home, bringing sorrow, grief beyond enduring, to his parents
how i sail across the fish-filled seas
sufficient trouble—you here lamenting
that's how the loyal swineherd hugged telemachus
skilled in many magic potions, i met hermes of the golden wand
he, one solitary individual, stepped forward with an expression of contempt and superiority, as the pioneer of a brand new style of culture, art, and morality, into that world, a scrap of which we would count it an honour to catch
immortal night would end before i finished
he was pasturing his rich flocks in the fields
so he can quickly tell that fair-haired nymph
i will take care of this, make sure it comes to pass
phaeacians, how does this man seem to you for beauty, stature, and within himself,
king agamemnon stood up, hands gripping his staff, one fashioned by hephaestus' careful craftsmanship
when all of us, astonished, questioned him, he spoke out,
hephaestus is not home
until the cries of warfare reached my ships
hector, aeneas, and godlike chromius, afraid of both ajaxes, moved back once again, leaving aretus lying there with a mortal wound
the way you men behave
odysseus was alert enough to drop his staff
who hears and watches over everything
the two lapiths now began to kill in earnest
they straightened it, while i,
underneath he spread an untanned hide and on top
a double fold across her shoulders, and sandals
which i have reached, all these things will happen
went to the dark-water spring
does not happen to them later
in the home of the son of atreus,
for these cows and lovely sheep belong to helios,
for no matter what he says, she undermines it
when the fighting spirit in xanthus had been broken,the two gods fought no longer
then diomedes grabbed a spear and went away
meanwhile four women serving in her home
when this task was over,
he sliced up small pieces, then got them ready on the spits
they strike at me and hatch their wicked plans
seven talents of finely crafted gold,
and we found warrior menoetius and yourself, together with achilles
the sound of reconciliation from another world echoes most purely perhaps in oedipus at colonus
were more attracted to a nasty scheme
about your noble father
is always harder than a stone
where does he come from?
away from there and sailed in here at night
then my provisions would have all been spent,
feed your swift-footed horses properly
no god,hephaestus,can stand against you
but, yielding to my strength and power,
through her tears, she spoke to him—her words had wings:
but once i would reached my ships beside the sea
half-way between tenedos and rocky imbros, a wide cavern sits deep within the sea
greek art and pre-eminently greek tragedy delayed above all the destruction of myth
what is left now for music is music of stimulation or memory, that is, either music as a means of stimulating jaded and worn out nerves or sound painting
spoke out, and we came in and caught her
our guest, when he gets back, can tell his friends just how much we surpass all other men
she would come down there
and i agree with them
they were amazed to see these birds with their own eyes
he moved through those fighting in the front, like a swift hawk swooping down on daws or starlings
daughter of zeus,leave war and fights alone
one of them may hear
but telemachus ignored what he would just said
eurymachus—he gives more courting gifts
and give him a sharp spear, as a defense
they will both soon lose the urge to stay in bed
then housekeeper eurynome said to her:
out of this house against her will the one
which you may have seen with your own eyes
hector understood her words
why talk that way?
if i would had the foresight to anticipatewhat zeus is doing now when eurystheussent hercules down to the house of hades,the gate keeper, to fetch back from erebushades' dreadful hound, he would never have escapedthe deep rushing waters of the river styx
by that corpse ajax took many of their lives
in earlier days, all mortal men would claimthat priam's city was rich in gold and bronze
menelaus, son of atreus,
you must run quickly to achaean shipsto tell achilles, so he can bring the corpsein safety to his ship—the naked body,for now hector of the gleaming helmetwears his armour
let that bird appear over to your right,so, once you witness it with your own eyes,you can have faith, as you go to the shipsof those fast-riding argives
mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing zeus,planted elm trees all around his body
then one of her women
all other choral lyrics of the greeks are only an immense intensification of the apollonian solo singer; whereas in the dithyramb a congregation of unconscious actors stands before us, who look upon each other as transformed
she came out, bringing with her a basin and a water jug
there the attendants quickly set about their work
for agamemnon, to make sure his fame
was such a great one, and he killed so many
and have returned from pylos
wise penelope heard his words and rebuked melantho, saying to her:
because on trojan soil you were the king
among them, peleus' son began the urgent lamentations, placing his murderous hands on the chest of his companion,
what if i go out to stand against himbefore the city?
in his stubbornness, he refused to do that, swearing this oath:
if i, acting all alone, was overwhelmed
at these grinding stones twelve women used to work, making barley meal and flour, which feed men's marrow
noemon, son of phronius, then answered antinous:
they saw hector, skilled at war cries, his companions, all the soldiers standing idle in the rear,  all those warriors battling on by their swift ships
they found him inside his house, at a marriage feast he was providing for his many relatives,
but my heart prompts me nowto stand against you face to face once more,whether i kill you, or you kill me
with my people prospering around me
the bonze point drove on through
with a bright veil on her face
when they all came inside the son of atreus' hut, agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed an ox,a male five years old, to the exalted son of cronos
now, let's talk of something else
a much larger stone, swung it round, and threw it, using all his unimaginable force
since you owe your life to me
for agamemnon had dishonoured the god's priest, chryses, who would come to the ships to find his daughter, chryseis, bringing with him a huge ransom
with a boar to be butchered for the suitors,
the man who triumphs will call you his dear wife
groups of men are quick to grow enraged
are you suffering now?
or shall i tell the truth?
the river's stream flowed once more in its channel
but she left behind
supporting irus will use his heavy fists
instead his fate decrees
that mare i was awardedi freely give you
perhaps a goddess, or maybe a woman—
i must be frank
if you string the bow, you will face great trouble
i will take him someday on a trim black ship
back to his father's house
well, see how nicely this filthy beggar talks,
but hera,unable to contain her anger, burst out:
with that, dream flew off, sweet sleep released me
or have you come with news?
that's what i said, and their proud hearts agreed
and about a feast
what you have said
at that moment, achilles, slapping his thighs, said to patroclus:
now suddenly a tidal wave of the dionysian takes the single small individual crests on its back, just as the brother of prometheus, the titan atlas, shouldered the earth
a mighty oath i would not tell you,
returning from the ethiopians, saw him
a youthful palm-tree shoot growing up
who would find it easy to shift that bed
helen, child of zeus, who bears the aegis, sat down
while we are moving through the countryside
son of lord aretias, spoke to them and said:
they gathered piles of wood and made perfect sacrificial offerings to the gods
all the crew fell overboard and floated on the waves, like cormorants,
when he came to the wealthy land of ithaca,
as for the flocks those arrogant suitors stole,
the men must know our claim: we are sworn friends from our fathers' days till now!
no way to escape it now
helen the child of zeus replied, that's laertes' son, the great tactician odysseus
that was the time he shipped him to lemnos fortress, sold him off and the son of jason paid the price for the slave, but a stranger there released him from his chains, eetion out of imbros paid a princely ransom and sent him off to arisbe's shining walls
no messenger brought the truth of how her husband made his stand outside the gates
and what were the fighters thinking?
you raw recruit, green at the skills of battle!
i know him too well — he will never win me over!
that's what saved them, that alone, they and their ships along the churning surf
i yearned, in a boy’s way, to approach the king and take him by the hand
as he tries to lift an enormous rock, pallas rifles a spear that strikes his spine midway where it parts the ribs, and wrenches back the shaft that’s wedged in the bone as hisbo pounces down on him, filled with the hope to take his man off guard
no change of heart, not even a little?
but aeneas’ force is locked fast in its own ramparts now, no hope of a breakout
she nurses a lifelong love of chastity and the hunt while she remains untouched
what, are you apollo’s sister?
he vowed to me long ago, he bowed his head that i should never embark for home till i had brought the walls of ilium crashing down
throned in their midst, greatest in years and first in power, sits latinus, the king’s brow hardly marked by joy
latinus replied in a calming, peaceful way: brave of the brave, my boy, the more you excel in feats of daring, the more it falls to me to weigh the perils, with all my fears, the lethal risks we run
now turnus glories in that spoil, exults to make it his
but would to god i would hit you deep in the guts and ripped your life away!
like zeus's bolts when the lord of bright-haired hera flashes lightning, threatening to loose torrential rain or pelting hail or snow when a blizzard drifts on fields — or driving on, somewhere on earth, the giant jaws of rending war — so thick-and-fast the groans came from atrides, wrenching his chest, heaving up from his heart and rocked his very spirit to the core
love me as you do, you ca not persuade me now
but ajax, shielding patroclus round with his broad buckler, stood fast now like a lion cornered round his young when hunters cross him, leading his cubs through woods — he ramps in all the pride of his power, bristling strength, the heavy folds of his forehead frowning down his eyes
capaneus' good son sthenelus saw them coming and quickly alerted diomedes, warnings flying: tydides, joy of my heart, dear comrade, look!
so he must have commanded — you maniac, you obeyed
but i, i will be there in person at your tents to take briseis in all her beauty, your own prize — so you can learn just how much greater i am than you and the next man up may shrink from matching words with me, from hoping to rival agamemnon strength for strength!
so he dispatched me, to teach you all these things, to make you a man of words and a man of action too
if my songs have any power, the day will never dawn that wipes you from the memory of the ages, not while the house of aeneas stands by the capitol’s rock unshaken, not while the roman father rules the world
aeneas said no more
then men who lived in methone and thaumacia, men who held meliboea and rugged ridged olizon: philoctetes the master archer had led them on in seven ships with fifty oarsmen aboard each, superbly skilled with the bow in lethal combat
but i with my courage, my hands, never conquered — for all their force not all the gods on olympus heights could ever turn me back
here nisus halts, looking back for his lost friend, no use— my poor euryalus!
exhausted, frenzied with building hunger, starved so long, his jaws parched for blood
soon as you ripen into manhood, reaching back for the models of your kin, remember— father aeneas and uncle hector fire your heart!
come, this handsome cup: accept it from me, i beg you!
rising in anger, zeus who drives the storm clouds thundered, insatiable hera!
you’ve earned your rest at last
you all stand forewarned!
digging a heel in his chest menelaus stripped his gear and vaunted out in glory, so home you will run from our racing ships, by god, all as corpses — see, you death-defying trojans?
he never commanded you to settle here on crete
king latinus has them summoned into the palace and takes his fathers’ throne amidst them all
the fighters loosed their sweating teams from the yokes, tethered them by the reins, each at his own chariot
still you could bring them round with gifts and winning words
he clutched a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him, ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft
he lunged in with a spear at thestor's son alcmaon, stabbed him, dragged out the shaft as the victim, caving into the spear's pull, pitched headfirst and his fine bronze armor clashed against his corpse
so you are no offspring of tydeus, the gallant, battle-hardened oeneus' son!
these, these were the captains of achaea and the kings
what a cortege you’ll see, old tiber, flowing past the massive tomb just built!
then, their weeping over, they lay his corpse on a litter, swathe him round in purple robes that form the well-known shroud
the true name of the old river albula’s lost and gone
he made his way through achaea's ships and shelters, flaring his great crimson cape with a strong hand and stopped at odysseus' huge black-bellied hull, moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings, upshore to telamonian ajax' camp or down to achilles' — trusting so to their arms' power and battle-strength they would hauled their trim ships up on either flank
meriones gave odysseus bow, quiver and sword and over his head he set a helmet made of leather
first agamemnon lord of men spilled the giant odius, chief of the halizonians off his car — the first to fall, as he veered away the spearhead punched his back between the shoulders, gouging his flesh and jutting out through his ribs — he fell with a crash, his armor rang against him
but if they are bent on seizing other countries, other people now, and it’s in their power to put our land astern, then we’ll build them twenty ships of italian oak
just step this way!
and our bravest man is dead, sarpedon, zeus's son — did zeus stand by him?
never without you, when i am bent on glory, whether in word or action, peace or war, you have my trust forever
so rose the relentless din of horse and fighting men breaking against them now as they struggled back to shore
no more running away
but you wo not lift a hand to fight beside them
then back over her brow she draped her headdress, fine fresh veils for hera the queen of gods, their pale, glimmering sheen like a rising sun, and under her smooth feet she fastened supple sandals
all hot pursuit, aeneas brandishes high his spear, that tree of a spear, and shouts from a savage heart: more delay!
or have the trojans sworn to carve you a fine estate?
but there you sit, hurling abuse at the son of atreus, agamemnon, marshal of armies, simply because our fighters give atrides the lion's share of all our plunder
with that, he binds his own brows with his mother’s myrtle
— queen hera wondered, her eyes glowing wide
the son of atreus, that skilled breaker of horses?
now tell me, muse, who were the bravest of them all, of the men and chariot-teams that came with atreus' sons?
resounding applause, cries of partisans fill the woods and the curving bayshore rolls the sound around and the pelted hillsides volley back the roar
but once at the front, hold off from the spear-play, out of range ourselves since who of us wants to double wounds on wounds?
to me your mother bore you
but here i fear the worst, i dread a breakthrough
three thracians too, of the northwind’s lofty stock, and three whom their father, idas, and fatherland ismarus sent away to the wars, but clausus kills them all with a novel twist of death for each
look at this prize!
go home with your ships and comrades, lord it over your myrmidons!
if only i’d gone down under your right hand—diomedes, strongest greek afield— and poured out my life on the battlegrounds of troy!
that's his hope, his prayer, thanks to achilles, ironbound by the ships and filled with anger still
give us this chance to make our way to aeneas, pallanteum too, and you’ll soon see us back, loaded with spoils, some bloody killing done
four altars to neptune
we will hand you agamemnon's loveliest daughter, lead her here from argos, marry her off to you if you will just help us raze the walls of troy
beachhead in latium, armies gather in death, caieta, aeneas’ nurse, you too have granted our shores a fame that never dies
and troy up in flames?
and do not go flying off on your own across the halls, a bird of evil omen — you ca not dissuade me now
the rest of the gods had feasted full on oxen, true, but the huntress alone, almighty zeus's daughter — oeneus gave her nothing
yours was the first bread i broke, demeter's gift, that day you seized me in priam's well-fenced orchard, hauled me away from father, loved ones, sold me off in holy lemnos and i, i fetched you a hundred bulls — and once released i brought three times that price
but if this image of devotion cannot move you, here, this bough—showing the bough enfolded in her robes— you know it well
there is the story of italy, rome in all her triumphs
that breathed enormous strength in the good captain — right through the front he went, helmed in flashing bronze
at once he went for automedon with that spear — quick as a god, the aide of swift achilles — keen to cut him down but his veering horses swept him well away — magnificent racing stallions, gifts of the gods to peleus, shining immortal gifts
but you’re not slow when it comes to nightly bouts of love, when the curved flute strikes up some frantic bacchic dance!
— and they vowed a princely gift
far in front, palinurus leads the tight formation, a line commanded to set their course by him
taking their lead, the ladies fill the shrine with the smoke of incense, pouring out their wails from the steep threshold: you, power of armies, queen of the battle, pallas, virgin goddess, shatter that phrygian pirate’s spear!
teuthras first, orestes lasher of stallions next, an aetolian spearman trechus, oenomaus and helenus, oenops' son, and oresbius cinched with shining belt who had lived in hyle hoarding his great wealth, his estate aslope the shores of lake cephisus, and round him boeotians held the fertile plain
all looked up, overjoyed — the people's spirits lifted
and with that he flung a javelin at his enemy, planting one shaft after another, racing round in a sweeping ring but the golden boss of aeneas’ shield stands fast
he thought he would take the city of priam then, that very day, the fool
and it’s no new love, you know, that stirs diana, no sweet lightning bolt of passion
i tell you this, and it would have come to pass: once my lightning had blasted you in your chariot, you could never have returned to mount olympus where the immortals make their home
and camilla too, our ally sprung from volscian stock, heading her horsemen, squadrons gleaming bronze
all but my prize of honor
she swore as he urged and sounded out the names of all the gods in the tartarean pit we call the titans
they cried with one voice
there he stood, tensing, braced to take them on — his huge pike kept beating the trojans off the hulls, any attacker flinging tireless fire, and all the time that terrible voice of his, bellowing out to cohorts, friends!
and the more they fight, the hotter their battle fury grows and now the trojans mass, regrouping to storm the site, clashing man to man, daring to foray farther out
i feel the wrong i do to one so dear, robbing him of his kingdom, lands in the west, his fields decreed by fate
and their backbones creaked as scuffling hands tugged for submission-holds and sweat streamed down their spines and clusters of raw welts broke out on ribs and shoulders slippery, red with blood, and still they grappled, harder, locking for victory, locked for that burnished tripod: odysseus no more able to trip and bring to ground his man than ajax could — odysseus' brawn held out
and ares led them in with the deadly queen enyo bringing uproar on, the savage chaos of battle — the god of combat wielding his giant shaft in hand, now ranging ahead of hector, now behind him
hector in glory cutting patroclus down with hacking bronze then tearing the handsome war-gear off his back?
three aides at his side the trojan killed—off guard, sprawled in a snarl of arms, then remus’ armor-bearer, then his charioteer, he caught him under his horses’ hoofs
quickly they swerve their prows and row for town
once they reached the warships moored at the hellespont the contingents scattered, each man to his own ship, but achilles still would not dismiss his myrmidons, he gave his battle-loving comrades strict commands: charioteers in fast formation — friends to the death!
noemon led her off while atrides took instead the polished cauldron bright in all its sheen
struggling shoulder-to-shoulder, triton and cymothoë hoist and heave the ships from the jagged rocks as the god himself whisks them up with his trident, clearing a channel through the deadly reefs, his chariot skimming over the cresting waves on spinning wheels to set the seas to rest
he will even honor you on a par with his orestes, full-grown by now, reared in the lap of luxury
he knew the goddess' voice — he went on the run, flinging off his cape as eurybates picked it up, the herald of ithaca always at his side
and the great rout you see is helpless, still not buried
how wretched we are, she cries, that no greek soldier dragged us off to die in the war beneath our country’s walls
all face the sea at the far edge of sandy pylos and the men who live within them, rich in sheep-flocks, rich in shambling cattle, will honor you like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath your scepter's sway live out your laws in sleek and shining peace
achaeans will never know where to find his bones, never collect them now — i will bury that man so deep in mud and rocks!
wild with striving, sergestus— wheeling his prow toward the rock, risking an inside track, the dangerous straits—crashes into the jutting reefs, unlucky man
myself, now that i’ve reached my peaceful haven, here at the harbor’s mouth i’m robbed of a happy death
where’s your fame that thrilled all sicily once?
officiating, aeneas produced two pairs of gauntlets matched in weight and bound both fighters’ hands with equal weapons
and last he picked up two tough spears, tipped in bronze, honed sharp, and the glare flashed off their brazen points and pierced the high skies — and awestruck at the sight athena and hera loosed a crack of thunder, exalting the great king of mycenae rich in gold
his trusty comrade achates keeps his pace and the same cares weigh down his plodding steps
permit us to haul our storm-racked ships ashore, trim new oars, hew timbers out of your woods, so that, if we are fated to sail for italy—king and crews restored— to italy, to latium we will sail with buoyant hearts
this she bears away, her features veiled in a heavy mist, this she distils in secret into the river water poured in burnished bowls, and fills them with healing power and sprinkles ambrosial juices bringing health, and redolent cure-all too
treat your guests like kings
lunging at paris, he grabbed his horsehair crest, swung him round, started to drag him into argive lines and now the braided chin-strap holding his helmet tight was gouging his soft throat — paris was choking, strangling
that's how far we outnumber them, i would say — achaeans to trojans — the men who hail from troy at least
hugging the shaft he writhed, gasping, shuddering like some wild bull in the hills that herdsmen shackle, trapping the beast with twisted ropes and he fights them all the way as the men drag him off — so he gasped with his wound
jove is just that brief, but golden venus is far from brief as she replies: oh father, everlasting king over men and all the world, what other force could we implore to save us now?
any decent man, a man with sense, loves his own, cares for his own as deeply as i, i loved that woman with all my heart, though i won her like a trophy with my spear
look at the souvenirs she left me!
worthless husks, the men you rule — if not, atrides, this outrage would have been your last
oh i had my share of troubles for you, achilles, did my share of labor
he gave you, mantua, walls and his mother’s name, mantua, rich in the rosters of her forebears
and at last she tears herself away, his enemy forever, fleeing back to the shadowed forests where sychaeus, her husband long ago, answers all her anguish, meets her love with love
pray god the news will never reach my ears!
i give way, my son
no more wavering now, now buoyant spirits seize aeneas’ heart
zeus let loose a terrific bolt and blazing white at the hoofs of diomedes' team it split the earth, a blinding smoking flash — molten sulphur exploding into the air, stallions shying, cringing against the car — and the shining reins flew free of nestor's grip
nevertheless — clearly victory goes to menelaus dear to ares
he stood there speechless a while, struck dumb
i will infiltrate their entire army, i will, all the way till i reach the ship of agamemnon!
the armies massing
once it had burned down and the flames died away, he scattered the coals and stretching the spitted meats across the embers, raised them onto supports and sprinkled clean pure salt
and achilles led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow, laying his man-killing hands on his great friend's chest, convulsed with bursts of grief
an eerie numbness unnerved him head to toe with dread, his hackles bristled in horror, voice choked in his throat
and i, if i would lanced your guts with bronze — strong as you are and cocksure of your hands — you would give me glory now, you would give your life to the famous horseman death!
up to his side he dashed and flanked great ajax tight, let fly with a spear and the glinting spearpoint hit the son of phausias, apisaon captain of armies, square in the liver, up under the midriff — his knees went limp as eurypylus rushed in, starting to rip the armor off his shoulders
and then, once he has bowed down to an unjust peace, may he never enjoy his realm and the light he yearns for, never, let him die before his day, unburied on some desolate beach!
but if you dare help your brother at closer range, go and do so, it becomes you
far apart on the shield, what’s more, he forged the homes of hell, the high gates of death and the torments of the doomed, with you, catiline, dangling from a beetling crag, cringing before the furies’ open mouths
they crowd the thwarts, their arms tense at the oars, ears tense for the signal; hearts pounding, racing with nerves high-strung and a grasping lust for glory
i have my own fate too, counter to theirs, to stamp out these accursed people with my sword— they’ve stolen away my bride!
and here the dreaded ferryman guards the flood, grisly in his squalor—charon
stop confusing my fixed resolve with this, this weeping and wailing just to serve his pleasure, atreus' mighty son
coroebus could not bear the sight of it—mad with rage he flung himself at the greek lines and met his death
seven women he will give you, flawless, skilled in crafts, women of lesbos — the ones he chose, his privilege, that day you captured the lesbos citadel yourself: they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty
at that, helenus first performs a sacrifice, slaughters many bulls
the fates have given mortals hearts that can endure
that's why the archer sends us pains and he will send us more and never drive this shameful destruction from the argives, not till we give back the girl with sparkling eyes to her loving father — no price, no ransom paid — and carry a sacred hundred bulls to chryse town
and as for our wives, each in her own hall must set big fires burning
not all of us here will die today without revenge
but aeneas, pressed by a crowd of friends and iulus grieving sorely— the fighter stood there bridling, fuming, hunched on his rugged spear, unmoved by all their tears
his daughter had married hector helmed in bronze
fearing this, the almighty father banished the winds to that black cavern, piled above them a mountain mass and imposed on all a king empowered, by binding pact, to rein them back on command or let them gallop free
i know of no troves of treasure, piled, lying idle, anywhere
so the blissful gods were rousing both opposing armies, clashing front to front but then, in their own ranks, their overpowering strife broke out in massive war
so i must do all i can to pay her back, the price for the life she saved
stop the attack, do not fight them at their ships!
our part is always to magnify your power
but, oh, how little they know, the omniscient seers
no more standing back, no fighting these argives at a distance — kill them hand-to-hand
but the rest of the long-haired achaeans will hold out, right here, until we have plundered troy
next mnestheus goes for gyas, the huge chimaera stripped of her helmsman, giving up the lead
he found polydamas, panthous' son, and prince agenor and reaching aeneas and hector helmed in bronze, shoulder-to-shoulder let his challenge fly: hector, you have wiped your allies from your mind!
but now meriones pulled back to his cohorts, stung with rage for two defeats at once: victory shattered, spearshaft smashed to bits
how can i go on living?
we must hurry now
piercing the tendons, ankle to heel behind both feet, he knotted straps of rawhide through them both, lashed them to his chariot, left the head to drag and mounting the car, hoisting the famous arms aboard, he whipped his team to a run and breakneck on they flew, holding nothing back
be gracious, guard your faithful
sped home on the winds to greece
too late for such defense, such help
off they went to the tents of agamemnon — a few sharp commands and the work was done
first we sight the gulf of tarentum, hercules’ town, if the tale is true, then looming over the waves ahead, lacinian juno’s temple, caulon’s fort on the rugged coast of scylaceum, wrecker of ships, then far across the seas, rising up from the swells, we can see mount etna, sicily, hear the tremendous groaning of waters, pounding rocks, the resounding roar of breakers crashing on the shore— reefs spring up, swirling sand in the sea-surge
you are his wife, with every right to probe him with your prayers
spurring them on and first to seize a deadly brand, she held it high in her right hand, shook it to flame and with all her power hurled the fire home
the old charioteer moved in and woke him roughly, dug a heel in his ribs, chiding him to his face, up with you, diomedes!
you are my son
if, with turnus dead, i am ready to take the trojans on as allies, why not stop the war while he is still alive?
even priam might pity our embattled troops
forced back from them, true, they braced for battle still and made a stand
the crime they committed once should be enough!
weaving a growing web, a dark red folding robe, working into the weft the endless bloody struggles stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze had suffered all for her at the god of battle's hands
already i have let fly at two of their best men, diomedes and menelaus — i have hit them both, and the blood gushed from both, direct hits, but i only roused their fury
rhipeus falls too, the most righteous man in troy, the most devoted to justice, true, but the gods had other plans
so now dismiss them from the pyre, have them prepare an evening meal
else for a good long while i would have felt the pain, writhing among the corpses there, or soldiered on, weak as a breathless ghost, beaten down by bronze
the latins, their eyes, their looks are trained on you
— you with the gall to go against my onslaught
and the quick oilean ajax heard him clearly, first on the run along the fighting front to meet him — idomeneus after him and idomeneus' good aide, meriones, a match for the butcher god of war
and the old king motioned a steward standing by to pour some clear pure water over his hands, and she came forward, bearing a jug and basin
breaking ranks they rushed ahead in their chariot, charging diomedes already dismounted, rearing up on foot
menacing so that tydeus' son pulled back, just a little, edging clear of the distant deadly archer's rage
and once you have roused our lines to the last man, we will hold out here and fight the argives down, hard-hit as we are — necessity drives us on
with that, he extends his right hand toward his friend ilioneus, greeting serestus with his left, and then the others, gallant gyas, gallant cloanthus
stunned by pictures of these disasters blurring through his mind, turnus stood there, staring, speechless, churning with mighty shame, with grief and madness all aswirl in that one fighting heart: with love spurred by rage and a sense of his own worth too
radiant gifts the gods presented peleus that day they drove you into a mortal's marriage bed
so he pleaded and hearing the old man's prayers, zeus who rules the world let loose a great crack of thunder, rending the skies
she and the boy and a servant finely gowned were standing watch on the tower, sobbing, grieving
let him get used to watching you in action, admire you as his model from his youth
aeneas the trojan captain checked him sharply: no talk of turning for home!
by now early dawn had risen up from the saffron bed of tithonus, scattering fresh light on the world
if only some other fighter had your years and you could march with the younger, fitter men!
the common people are split into warring factions
take up a long spear, shield on your shoulder, go for the trojans, urge your troops to battle
did i press him to leave his camp or cast his life to the winds?
from then on, we have solemnized this service and all our heirs have kept the day with joy
they’d come on the man by chance, a total stranger
we achaeans will pay you back, three, four times over, if zeus will grant us the gift, somehow, someday, to raze troy's massive ramparts to the ground
let idaeus add this too, a good sound proposal: see if they are willing to halt the brutal war until we can burn the bodies of our dead
no one at all to fear
or did your own itch for glory spur you on?
no more for them
i slipped through the door, up to the jutting roof where the doomed trojans were hurling futile spears
they lived off branches, berries and acorns, hunters’ rough-cut fare
the first among all, you would bear off shining, priceless gifts from him
so he triumphed and now he was bent on outrage, on shaming noble hector
apollo comes to your call
when he saw aeneas striding toward him over the fields, he reached out both his hands as his spirit lifted, tears ran down his cheeks, a cry broke from his lips: you’ve come at last?
zeus knows, no doubt, and every immortal too, which fighter is doomed to end all this in death
three times the cliffs roared out from between the hollow caves, three times we saw the spume exploding to spray the stars
when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man's land along his lines he strode, gripping his spear mid-haft, staving men to a standstill while agamemnon seated his argives geared for combat
i’ll lull him into a deep sleep and hide him far away on cythera’s heights or high idalium, my shrines, so he cannot learn of my trap or spring it open while it’s being set
let it remind you of the burial of patroclus
before his eyes the god of the lovely river, old tiber himself, seemed to rise from among the poplar leaves, gowned in his blue-grey linen fine as mist with a shady crown of reeds to wreathe his hair, and greeted aeneas to ease him of his anguish: born of the stock of gods, you who bring back troy to us from enemy hands and save her heights forever!
the guide and giant-killer refused him firmly, you test me again, old man, since i am young, but you will not persuade me, tempting me with a gift behind achilles' back
i seem to remember once before you fled my spear
there's powerful diomedes brought down by an archer, odysseus wounded, and agamemnon too, the famous spearman, and eurypylus took an arrow-shot in the thigh
they look up—the terrific peals come crashing over and over— and see blood-red in a brilliant sky, rifting a cloudbank, armor clashing out
i dedicate you, lausus, decked in the spoils i strip from that pirate’s corpse— my son, my living trophy over aeneas!
the skies have begun to rumble, peals of thunder first and the storm breaking next, a cloudburst pelting hail and the troops of hunters scatter up and down the plain, tyrian comrades, bands of dardans, venus’ grandson iulus panicking, running for cover, quick, and down the mountain gulleys erupt in torrents
what will your rutulians, all the rest of italy say if i betray you to death—may fortune forbid!— while you appeal for my daughter’s hand in marriage?
with my own eyes i saw him, clear, in broad daylight, moving through your gates
even if zeus the thundering lord of hera lets you seize your glory, you must not burn for war against these trojans, madmen lusting for battle — not without me — you will only make my glory that much less
diomedes killed the man and his aide-in-arms at once, axylus and calesius who always drove his team — both at a stroke he drove beneath the earth
but paris replied at once to helen's challenge: no more, dear one — do not rake me with your taunts, myself and all my courage
and with that he issues orders: trim your sails!
time and again i heard your claims in father's halls, boasting how you and you alone of all the immortals
rumor flies that idomeneus, famous cretan prince, has fled his father’s kingdom, an exile, and the shores of crete are now deserted, clear of enemies, homes derelict, standing ready for us to settle
now, again, your phoebus apollo pulls you through, the one you pray to, wading into our storm of spears
tell atrides to arm his long-haired achaeans, to attack at once, full force — now he can take the broad streets of troy
since fighting hector's flanked by god almighty
their cries rang out
the king of men agamemnon hailed him quickly: nestor, son of neleus, great pride of achaea, why turn your back on the lines where men are dying?
he picked off clitus, pisenor's shining son — the charioteer to noble panthous' son polydamas — wrestling the reins, struggling to head his horses straight for the point where most battalions panicked, eager to please prince hector and all his trojans, clitus raced on but his death came even faster
in the same breath he stretched his loving arms but could not seize him, no, the ghost slipped underground like a wisp of smoke
with that he put new strength in each man's spirit
all the warlords sounded their assent
which pact can he embrace?
come now, my olympian, swear your inviolate oath that he shall lord it over all who dwell around him — that child who drops between a woman's knees today, born of the stock of men who spring from zeus's blood
oh, my poor doomed people!
but now the son of tydeus came upon the king, the thirteenth man, and ripped away his life, his sweet life as he lay there breathing hard
from here i sailed
we broke our sworn truce
you, phoebus, herded his shambling crook-horned cattle along the spurs of ida's timbered ridges
they say you are peleus' son, that fine, flawless man; your mother, thetis, sleek-haired child of the sea
now as the king and queen provoked each other, glistening-footed thetis reached hephaestus' house, indestructible, bright as stars, shining among the gods, built of bronze by the crippled smith with his own hands
but i live on, not yet have i left the land of men and light of day but i will leave it all!
and so in the same breath i mourn for you and me, my doom-struck, harrowed heart!
yes, so the generation of dardanus will not perish, obliterated without an heir, without a trace: dardanus, dearest to zeus of all the sons that mortal women brought to birth for father
as mezentius spied him routing the lines far off, crested in purple plumes, the blue of his bride-to-be— like a famished lion stalking the cattle pens for prey, for the hunger will often drive him mad, just let him spot some goat on the run or a stag’s antlers branching high: his big jaws gape at the sport, his mane bristles, then a pouncing assault!
the great tactician odysseus gave him a dark glance and shot back at once, now what's this, atrides, this talk that slips through your clenched teeth?
and you used to plan their victory!
laodamia lay in the arms of zeus who rules the world and she bore the god a son, our great commander, sarpedon helmed in bronze
and now achilles set out a lump of pig iron, the shot eetion used to put with all his power before the swift runner pelides brought him down and hauled it off in the ships with all his other wealth
oh how wrong it is, this anger you keep smoldering in your heart!
his brains burst from the wound in sprays of blood, soaking the weapon's socket — his strength dissolved on the spot, his grip loosed and he dropped the foot of brave patroclus' corpse
and many reap the benefits of that treasure: troops of men he saves, as he himself knows best
what if it's fated for us to die beside this body — all dead in a mass?
nor do you lack the other brands of outrage, all that shame you heaped on me, you rabid dogs!
they lie when they say you are born of storming zeus
as soon as the wretched latin women hear the worst, the queen’s daughter lavinia is the first to tear her golden hair and score her lustrous cheeks, the rest of the women round her mad with grief and the long halls resound with trilling wails of sorrow
for awaiting the queen, beneath the great temple now, exploring its features one by one, amazed at it all, the city’s splendor, the work of rival workers’ hands and the vast scale of their labors—all at once he sees, spread out from first to last, the battles fought at troy, the fame of the trojan war now known throughout the world, atreus’ sons and priam—achilles, savage to both at once
why have swords or useless lances gripped in our fists?
and king agamemnon, thrilled to see his efforts, cheered him on with a flight of praise: old war-horse, if only your knees could match the spirit in your chest and your body's strength were planted firm as rock, but the great leveler, age, has worn you down
now, again, your phoebus apollo pulls you through, the one you pray to, wading into our storm of spears
are you that aeneas whom loving venus bore to dardan anchises on the simois’ banks at troy?
up with you — before all troy is torched to a cinder here and now!
in your hands alone the glory and power of king latinus rest, you alone can shore our sinking house
none of them knew it, each denied the mark
or you, serranus the sower, seeding your furrow?
the memories flooded over him, live tears flowing, and now he would lie on his side, now flat on his back, now facedown again
first pour out cups to father zeus and the other gods, then refresh yourself, if you would like to quench your thirst
and here is thetis now, in our own house!
she joined him now, and following in her steps a servant holding the boy against her breast, in the first flush of life, only a baby, hector's son, the darling of his eyes and radiant as a star
nestor stood there, stunned
and all my trojans join me, drinking deep of a trojan city’s welcome
here are the terms that i set forth — let zeus look down, my witness!
the great fighter sank to his knees, bracing himself with one strong forearm planted against the earth, and the world went black as night before his eyes
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind his heels with silver ankle-clasps, next he strapped the breastplate round his chest then over his shoulder achilles slung his sword, the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt, then hoisted the massive shield flashing far and wide like a full round moon — and gleaming bright as the light that reaches sailors out at sea, the flare of a watchfire burning strong in a lonely sheepfold up some mountain slope when the gale-winds hurl the crew that fights against them far over the fish-swarming sea, far from loved ones — so the gleam from achilles' well-wrought blazoned shield shot up and hit the skies
our kingdom is new
i know of no other armor
castaways, we know nothing, not the people, not the place— lost, hurled here by the gales and heavy seas
hope no more the gods’ decrees can be brushed aside by prayer
the old king woke in terror, roused the herald
but their master polydamas marked the kill at once, ran and planted himself across the horses' path and handed them on to protiaon's son astynous, shouting strict commands — watch my every move!
nearby, two four-horse chariots, driven to left and right, had torn mettus apart—man of alba, you should have kept your word— and tullus hauled the liar’s viscera through the brush as blood-drops dripped like dew from brakes of thorns
and on it flies, faster than spear or wind-swift shaft while the rest race on in her wake
lift up your prows, thrust them on, beaks plowing this enemy coast, keels cutting their own furrows!
all eyes are fixed on him—his blood is up and nothing can quench the fighter’s ardor now
the sword decides all once turnus sees his ranks of latins broken in battle, their spirits dashed and the war-god turned against them, now is the time, he knows, for him to keep his pledge
on it they always fixed their gifts to the local god and they hung their votive clothes in thanks for rescue
next diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud, hear me too, daughter of zeus, tireless goddess!
the rushing tiber still steams with our blood, the endless fields still glisten with our bones
lord marshal agamemnon rose up in their midst, streaming tears like a dark spring running down some desolate rock face, its shaded currents flowing
but night came on too soon
instantly there he stands, that immense man, dares, jaw thrust out, tremendous in all his power
they make a menace for every man in sight
acamas and the old hero pirous led the thracians, all the hellespont bounds within her riptide straits
listen to me, quickly!
so staunch they stood the trojan onslaught, never shrinking once as atrides ranged the ranks, shouting out commands: now be men, my friends!
so the outcome proved when the awestruck prophets sang the signs to later ages
the third can leave content with this greek helmet
everywhere — rocks, ramparts, breastworks swam with the blood of trojans, argives, both sides, but still the trojans could not rout the argives
have it your way
for all your power, soldier, crushed at my hands you will breach the gates of death!
mothers stand on the ramparts, trembling, eyes trailing the cloud of dust and the troops in gleaming bronze
holding it dear she tended it—marvelous devotion— draping the snow-white fleece and festal boughs
that sight was bruited about as a sign of wonder, terror: for lavinia, prophets sang of a brilliant fame to come, for the people they foretold a long, grueling war
book fourteen: hera outflanks zeus
poor fool — as if apollo would lift a hand to save him now from death, grim death
they hover at jove’s throne, crouch at his gates to serve that savage king and whet the fears of afflicted men whenever the king of gods lets loose horrific deaths and plagues or panics towns that deserve the scourge of war
here, flocking the altar, hecuba and her daughters huddled, blown headlong down like doves by a black storm— clutching, all for nothing, the figures of their gods
he screamed in flames, his clear currents bubbling up like a cauldron whipped by crackling fire as it melts down the lard of a fat swine, splattering up around the rim — dry logs blazing under it, lashing it to the boil — so the river burned, his clear currents seethed and lost all will to flow
saturn’s second child— such tides of rage go churning through your heart
he begged the whole achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders, atreus' two sons, agamemnon, menelaus — all argives geared for war!
certain it is, i warn you, we wo not break off from battle and leave the field with no more than a youngster's banter light as this
but nisus storms the thick of them, out for volcens, one among all, volcens his lone concern
sighs heaved from his depths as achilles burst forth, ah god, time and again, my doomed, my dearest friend, you would set before us a seasoned meal yourself, here in our tents, in your quick and expert way, when argive forces rushed to fight the trojans, stampeding those breakers of horses into rout
so jove declares, and turns his glance away from the latian fields below
if father hyrtacus ever gave you gifts in my name to grace your altars, if i have ever adorned them with hunting trophies, hanging them from your dome, fixing them to your roofs— help me rout my enemies!
then achilles called the serving-women out: bathe and anoint the body — bear it aside first
but they had no lust for the grind of battle now — where was the man who marched their lines to war?
low as the first stir of stormwind caught in the trees when the rustling unseen murmur keeps on rolling, warning sailors that gales are coming on
you are the ones i chose, my troops at troy’s last stand
to see if zeus will stretch his hands above your heads and save your craven lives?
don’t just stand there!— iapyx cries, the first to inflame their hearts against the foe
but all lies in the lap of the great gods
i will lie in peace, once i have gone down to death
smoldering at the father, seized with wild resentment
now, once they’d paraded past the assembled crowd, triumphant on horseback, bright in the eyes of kinsmen, all riders took their places and epytides from afar called out get set— a crack of his whip, and watch, the long column, split into three equal squads, splits into rows of six, in bands dancing away, then recalled at the next command they wheeled and charged each other, lances tense for attack, wheeling charge into countercharge, return and turn through the whole arena, enemies circling, swerving back in their armor, acting out a mock display of war, now baring their backs in flight, now turning spears for attack, now making peace and riding file by file
but asius captain of armies, hyrtacus' son refused to leave his horses there with a driver reining back — and on he drove at the fast trim ships, chariot and all, the fool
i bring you a message sent by zeus: he says the gods are angry with you now and he is rising over them all in deathless wrath that you in heartsick fury still hold hector's body, here by your beaked ships, and will not give him back
whenever odysseus met some man of rank, a king, he would halt and hold him back with winning words: my friend — it's wrong to threaten you like a coward, but you stand fast, you keep your men in check!
blind to your own realm, oblivious to your fate!
the best men donned the best, the worst the worst and soon as they strapped the bronze around their bodies, out they moved and the god of earthquakes led them on, grasping his terrible long sword in his massive hand, the grip of power, the blade like a lightning flash
aeneas struggled long, wasting time on the tough stump, no power of his could loose the timber’s stubborn bite
but till that hour i will never cease my anger
then all night long till the breaking light of day we keep the watch fires blazing, hundreds of fires and the rising glare can leap and hit the skies, so the long-haired achaeans stand no chance tonight to cut and run on the sea's broad back
she flung to the winds her glittering headdress, the cap and the coronet, braided band and veil, all the regalia golden aphrodite gave her once, the day that hector, helmet aflash in sunlight, led her home to troy from her father's house with countless wedding gifts to win her heart
and there was mnestheus too, his glory riding high with yesterday’s triumph—driving turnus off the walls— and capys too, whose name comes down to us in capua, the famed campanian town
he set two-handled jars of honey and oil beside him, leaned them against the bier — and then with wild zeal slung the bodies of four massive stallions onto the pyre and gave a wrenching groan
i call on the springs and streams, the gods enthroned in the arching sky and gods of the deep blue sea!
eyes widening, noble hera coaxed him further: so troubled, sleep, why torture yourself with that?
aeneas broke in now, for he saw a young man walking at marcellus’ side, handsome, striking, his armor burnished bright but his face showed little joy, his eyes cast down
he will never force the man to go
at last, gaining the door of father’s ancient house, my first concern was to find the man, my first wish to spirit him off, into the high mountain range, but father, seeing ilium razed from the earth, refused to drag his life out now and suffer exile
ascanius strong as a god and phorcys led the phrygians in from ascania due east, primed for the clash of combat
then, tired of all delays, of ripping out the shafts— outmatched, on the defensive—aeneas now at last, at his wit’s end, bursts forth and hurls his spear and it splits the temples of mezentius’ warhorse
why, you have paphus, idalia, steep cythera too— why tamper with brute italians, a city rife with war?
that’s not how father, the old soldier, opheltes, brought me up in the thick of the greek terror, the death-throes at troy
and teucer gave his captain a faultless answer: great field marshal, why bother to spur me on?
by this sign, after thirty years have made their rounds ascanius will establish alba, bright as the city’s name
does someone need me?
he suddenly feared for red-haired menelaus but diomedes strong with the war cry answered, is that an order?
but admetus' son eumelus came in last of all
when will you ever let them lift the siege?
trust me, either the greeks are hiding, shut inside those beams, or the horse is a battle-engine geared to breach our walls, spy on our homes, come down on our city, overwhelm us— or some other deception’s lurking deep inside it
they stowed them safe in his shelters, settled the women and proud henchmen drove the teams to his herds
turnus, soon as he saw aeneas falling back from the lines, his chiefs in disarray, ignites with a blaze of hope
such limited vengeance hurts me most of all — but i intend that we will part in peace, at last, trojans and achaeans
then liris, pagasus over him: liris struggling to clutch his reins, thrown from his horse as it goes sprawling under him—pagasus rushes to help his falling comrade, reaches out with an unarmed hand and both of them side by side pitch headlong down
adamas, asius' son, and asius son of hyrtacus — where's othryoneus, tell me
the point impaled his shield, a flimsy defense for the youngster’s brash threats, and the shirt his mother wove him of soft gold mesh and his lap filled up with blood, and then his life slipped through the air, sorrowing down to the shades and left his corpse behind
if i slip inside the gates and walls, polydamas will be first to heap disgrace on me — he was the one who urged me to lead our trojans back to ilium just last night, the disastrous night achilles rose in arms like a god
on the same night theano brought into light the son of amycus, hecuba, great with the torch, bore paris
pleading, springing up with a two-handled cup, he reached it toward his loving mother's hands with his own winning words: patience, mother!
while the men themselves, armed for full assault, leapt down and swarmed to the trench's edge on foot and a long undying roar went up in the early dawn
and now the two returned to the halls of mighty zeus — hera of argos, boeotian athena, guard of armies, both had stopped the murderous ares' cutting men to pieces
so the pilot countered, iron grip on the tiller, never loosing his grasp, his eyes fixed on the stars
i urge you, mother — you know that i am right — work back into his good graces, so the father, our beloved father will never wheel on us again, send our banquets crashing!
go on, now mock our courage with high and mighty talk!
that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon
but your queen has not deserted you, shorn of honor, not in your hour of death, nor will your death lack glory among the race of man, nor will you bear the shame of dying unavenged
mortal labor — the sweat i poured, my horses panting, spent from launching achaea's armies, heaping pains on priam and priam's sons
odius and eurybates, you escort them
but you won’t escape my blade, whirling in my right hand, cries turnus
no, medon formed them up, oileus' bastard son whom rhene bore to oileus, grim raider of cities
and swift achilles kept on coursing hector, nonstop as a hound in the mountains starts a fawn from its lair, hunting him down the gorges, down the narrow glens and the fawn goes to ground, hiding deep in brush but the hound comes racing fast, nosing him out until he lands his kill
i fathered hero sons in the wide realm of troy and now not a single one is left, i tell you
but the mortals there soon nursed a fallen immortal back to life
it's sacrilege for a single drop to touch my head till i place patroclus on his pyre and heap his mound and cut my hair for him — for a second grief this harsh will never touch my heart while i am still among the living
surely his body can be pierced by bronze, even his — he has only one life, and people say he's mortal: it's only the son of cronus handing him the glory
while he spoke, evander had marked his eyes, his features, his whole frame, and now he replies, pointedly: bravest of the trojans, how i welcome you, recognize you, with all my heart!
for my own father—now i remember—anchises left to me these secret signs of fate: when, my son, borne to an unknown shore, reduced to iron rations, hunger drives you to eat your own platters, then’s the moment, exhausted as you are, to hope for home
shrilling a woman’s cries and tearing her hair, insane, she rushes onto the high walls, seeking the front ranks posted there—without a thought for the fighters, none for the perils, the spears, no, she fills the air with wails of mourning: you— is this you i see, euryalus?
and spinning in terror off he ran but as he spun odysseus plunged a spear in his back between the shoulders — straight through his chest the shaft came jutting out and down socus crashed, odysseus vaunting over him: socus, son of hippasus, skilled breaker of horses, so, death in its rampage outraced you — no escape
nobody boasted he had struck aeneas
and out he marched, leading the way from council
and he sets afield a pair of trophies for the boxing: for the winner a bull with gilded horns and wreaths, a sword and a burnished helm to console the loser
but now the father gave it over to hector to guard his head in war since hector's death was closing on him quickly
but the trojan captains recognized the god, his immortal arms, and heard his arrows rustling in his quiver as he flew
why waste your breath?
and he shows him the grove of hallowed argiletum too, he swears by the spot, retells the death of argus, once his guest
do not pass over the better man and pick the worse
the men were forced to their seats, marshaled into ranks, the shouting died away
just as he dragged that corpse the brave agenor spied his ribs, bared by his shield as he bent low — agenor stabbed with a bronze spear and loosed his limbs, his life spirit left him and over his dead body now the savage work went on, achaeans and trojans mauling each other there like wolves, leaping, hurtling into each other, man throttling man
many a sleepless night i have bivouacked in harness, day after bloody day i have hacked my passage through, fighting other soldiers to win their wives as prizes
nothing can save you now — not even your silver-whirling, mighty-tiding river — not for all the bulls you have slaughtered to it for years, the rearing stallions drowned alive in its eddies
young men all come pouring from homes and fields and crowding mothers marvel, stare at her as she strides— awestruck, breathless, how the beauty of royal purple cloaks her glossy shoulders!
yes, thanks to you i rule this humble little kingdom of mine
there is an island fronting the bay of syracuse—over against plemyrium’s headland rocked by breakers—called ortygia once by men in the old days
down come the sails, the crewmen leap to the oars, no time to lose, they bend to it, churn the spray and sweep the clear blue sea
why, he would leap to accuse a friend without a fault
so she wavered, but the earth already held them fast, long dead in the life-giving earth of lacedaemon, the dear land of their fathers
none more just, none more devoted to duty, none more brave in arms
where have the fighting taunts all gone?
i see with my own eyes how zeus has blocked their finest archer's arrows
and the iron warrior brought his brother round — rough justice, fitting too
priam wept freely for man-killing hector, throbbing, crouching before achilles' feet as achilles wept himself, now for his father, now for patroclus once again, and their sobbing rose and fell throughout the house
finally diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth: atrides — i will be first to oppose you in your folly, here in assembly, king, where it's the custom
and he forged a fallow field, broad rich plowland tilled for the third time, and across it crews of plowmen wheeled their teams, driving them up and back and soon as they would reach the end-strip, moving into the turn, a man would run up quickly and hand them a cup of honeyed, mellow wine as the crews would turn back down along the furrows, pressing again to reach the end of the deep fallow field and the earth churned black behind them, like earth churning, solid gold as it was — that was the wonder of hephaestus' work
one hope saves the defeated: they know they can’t be saved!
does he still love his mother lost and gone?
the mass of troops i could never tally, never name, not even if i had ten tongues and ten mouths, a tireless voice and the heart inside me bronze, never unless you muses of olympus, daughters of zeus whose shield is rolling thunder, sing, sing in memory all who gathered under troy
come here, old friend, stand by me!
but father anchises lifts his eyes to the stars in joy and stretching his hands toward the sky, sings out: almighty jove!
it is no small labor to rescue all mankind, every mother's son
and next, once day broke in the east and put the stars to flight, aeneas summons his crews from down along the beach and greets them all from a mounded rise of ground: gallant sons of dardanus, born of the gods’ high blood, the wheeling year has passed, rounding out its months, since we committed to earth my godlike father’s bones, his relics, and sanctified the altars with our tears
quick, my friends, stand by him!
now, not far from here agylla city stands, founded on age-old rock by lydian people once, brilliant in war, who built on etruscan hilltops
why look, that man is worth an entire army, the fighter zeus holds dear with all his heart — how he exalts him now and mauls achaea's forces!
his war-belt lay beside him, gleaming in all its fire
but now, as it is, let him die and pay his debt to the trojans, pay with his own loyal blood
and they have no stomach left to fight to the end against the warships' sterns
strewn across the world, we all have borne unspeakable punishments, yes, we’ve paid the price in full for all our crimes
on one flank, caesar augustus leading italy into battle, the senate and people too, the gods of hearth and home and the great gods themselves
save your strength for better times to come
true, and what profit for us in the long run?
so he gloried but queen hera stirred in outrage, she shook on her throne and mount olympus quaked as she cried in the face of the rugged god poseidon, you ruthless — the earth-shaker with all your power — not even a twinge of pity deep inside your heart for all these argives dying!
what shattering anguish i would have suffered then if thetis had not taken me to her breast, eurynome too, the daughter of ocean's stream that runs around the world
only the twin snakes escape, sliding off and away to the heights of troy where the ruthless goddess holds her shrine, and there at her feet they hide, vanishing under minerva’s great round shield
and he forged on the shield two noble cities filled with mortal men
and zeus heard the chaos, throned on olympus heights, and laughed deep in his own great heart, delighted to see the gods engage in all-out conflict
they clung to their deathless hate of sacred troy, priam and priam's people, just as they had at first when paris in all his madness launched the war
if such a glorious destiny cannot fire your spirit, [if you will not shoulder the task for your own fame,] at least remember ascanius rising into his prime, the hopes you lodge in iulus, your only heir— you owe him italy’s realm, the land of rome!
and penthesilea leading her amazons bearing half-moon shields— she blazes with battle fury out in front of her army, cinching a golden breastband under her bared breast, a girl, a warrior queen who dares to battle men
i broke the faith i swore to the ashes of sychaeus
now a sharp ridge rises out in front of troy, all on its own and far across the plain with running-room around it, all sides clear
i will tell of horrendous wars, tell of battle lines and princes fired with courage, driven to their deaths, etruscan battalions, all hesperia called to arms
deucalion next — he lanced his arm with a bronze-shod spear, he spitted the trojan through where the elbow-tendons grip and there he stood, waiting achilles, arm dangling heavy, staring death in the face — and achilles chopped his neck and his sword sent head and helmet flying off together and marrow bubbling up from the clean-cut neckbone
but king agamemnon would not stop the quarrel, the first threat he hurled against achilles
achilles was lifting his spirits with it now, singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes
they all collected now, crowding into the royal halls through milling streets
these rites to jove of the styx that i have set in motion, i yearn to consummate them, end the pain of love, give that cursed trojan’s pyre to the flames
whose life would weigh him down to death?
you could hear some trojan or achaean calling, zeus — god of greatness, god of glory, all you immortals!
then they collected the white bones of hector — all his brothers, his friends-in-arms, mourning, and warm tears came streaming down their cheeks
in their command sailed thirty long curved ships
idomeneus cut down phaestus, maeonian bonis' son who shipped to troy from the good rich earth of tarne
after them, fast, full gallop!
hold on, full force — spur all our men to battle!
but he raged on, grimly camped by his fast fleet, the royal son of peleus, the swift runner achilles
then in the first light when we can trust the waves—a breeze has calmed the surf and a gentle rustling southwind makes the rigging sing, inviting us to sea—my crewmen crowd the beaches, launch the ships, and out from port we sail, leaving the land and cities sinking in our wake
and i thought his vaunts were empty, hollow boasting
they wage a relentless war against the latin people
camilla could skim the tips of the unreaped crops, never bruising the tender ears in her swift rush or wing her way, hovering over the mid-sea swell and never dip her racing feet in the waves
so she mocked, and the father of gods and mortals smiled broadly, calling the golden aphrodite over: fighting is not for you, my child, the works of war
next the men who held the strong-built city of athens, realm of high-hearted erechtheus
what heartbreak, now you lie in an unknown land, fresh game for the dogs and birds of latium!
gripping a sturdy spear, bronze-edged and sharp, he no sooner left his tent than stopped at once — what a grim, degrading piece of work he saw
he went on the run to achaea's ships and shelters, out for the heavy lance he would left aslant his hut
and he set to stripping his kill, paeon's spearman son
when he heard that, diomedes' spirits lifted
not that one trojan will ever take your lead — i will never permit it
let him whip the achaeans in headlong panic rout and roll them back once more, tumbling back on the oar-swept ships of peleus' son achilles
and men who lived in zelea under the foot of ida, a wealthy clan that drank the aesepus' dark waters — trojans all, and the shining son of lycaon led them on, pandarus, with the bow that came from apollo's own hands
zeus's daughter athena tended him once the grain-giving fields had borne him, long ago, and then she settled the king in athens, in her own rich shrine, where sons of athens worship him with bulls and goats as the years wheel round in season
oh, now at last i know the griefs of exile— i, in all my pain—at last a wound strikes home
mnestheus riding high, the higher for his success— oars at a racing stroke, wind at his beck and call— shoots into open water, homing down the coast
death never came, so now i can only waste away in tears
then the priceless ransom for hector's body: hauling it up from the vaults they piled it high on the wagon's well-made cradle, then they yoked the mules — stamping their sharp hoofs, trained for heavy loads — that the mysians once gave priam, princely gifts
how strong was achilles?
acestes, first to rush to his aged friend, pities entellus, hoists him off the ground
in her two sons' command sailed thirty long curved ships
phylas' daughter, polymela the gorgeous dancer bore the man when irresistible hermes, hermes the giant-killer lusted for her once — she ravished the god's bright eyes, swaying among the dancers singing goddess artemis with arrow of gold and cry that halloos the hunt
taking the trojans on alone, on the front lines but your comrade's dead, look, and hector himself, strapped in achilles' armor, swaggers on in glory!
both hands clawing the ground for soot and filth, he poured it over his head, fouled his handsome face and black ashes settled onto his fresh clean war-shirt
other hands can defend our city walls
wavering back and forth as their two attackers closed in a rush, whipping that purebred team along and pandarus shouted first, what mad bravado — lofty tydeus' boy will brave it out!
and now no man who waded into that work could scorn it any longer, anyone still not speared or stabbed by tearing bronze who whirled into the heart of all that slaughter — not even if great athena led him by the hand, flicking away the weapons hailing down against him
now — come, let's go to bed, let's lose ourselves in love!
a joy to your rivals, rank disgrace to yourself
but i, our home in flames, was shipped over strange seas, i bowed to the high and mighty pride of achilles’ son, produced him a child—in slavery
bear him first to his place of rest, bury him in his tomb
you are nothing to me — you and your overweening anger!
with that he dons androgeos’ crested helmet, his handsome blazoned shield and straps a greek sword to his hip, and comrades, spirits rising, take his lead
refrain from going hand to hand with the trojans!
when they had put aside desire for food and drink each went his way and slept in his own shelter
come, all we can do now is sit in the halls, far from our son, and wail for hector
the gods gave him beauty and the fine, gallant traits that go with men
who can stand against you?
go to athena's shrine, the queen of plunder, go with offerings, gather the older noble women and take a robe, the largest, loveliest robe that you can find throughout the royal halls, a gift that far and away you prize most yourself, and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess' knees
little iulus, clutching my right hand, keeps pace with tripping steps
the entire army answers his call to arms and brazen trumpets blast their harsh assent
the champion, never slowed by a fall, unshaken, goes back to fight and all the fiercer, anger fueling his power now, shame fires him up, and a sense of his own strength
his spear aimed in the melee — but adamas, asius' son missed nothing, he saw it all, rushed him, rammed antilochus' buckler dead center with sharp bronze but the blue-haired god poseidon crushed the spear, denied him the argive's life
juturna, terror-struck at the thought, the woman warrior knocks metiscus, turnus’ charioteer, from between the reins he grasps and leaves him sprawling far from the chariot pole as she herself takes over, shaking the rippling reins like metiscus to the life, his voice, his build, his gear
but he was a lightweight, trailed by a tiny band
now we will see, once and for all we will know if he returns as fast from his newest destination — or the firm life-giving earth can hold him down, the grave that hugs the strongest man alive
but soon as the lapiths saw the trojans storm the wall, and cries broke from the argives lost in sudden panic, then the two burst forth to fight before the gates like wild boars, a pair of them up on the hilltops bracing to take some breakneck rout of men and dogs and the two go slanting in on the charge, shattering timber round about them, shearing off the trunks at the roots and a grinding, screeching clatter of tusks goes up till a hunter spears them, tears their lives out — so the clatter screeched from the gleaming bronze that cased their chests as blows piled on blows
what good's to be won from tears that chill the spirit?
and so their spirits soared as they took positions down the passageways of battle all night long, and the watchfires blazed among them
turnus can sooner burn the ocean dry than burn these sacred pines of mine
apollo the son of zeus and leto
i bring you a message sent by zeus, a world away but he has you in his heart, he pities you now
arms, my comrades, bring me arms!
as long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger, the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
tearing his hair, defiling it with his own hands
here the enormous whirlpool gapes aswirl with filth, seethes and spews out all its silt in the wailing river
but thetis, clasping his knees, held on, clinging, pressing her question once again: grant my prayer, once and for all
not even they could bring his fighting spirit round until, at last, rocks were raining down on the chamber, curetes about to mount the towers and torch the great city!
priam and noble trojans command me to report, if it proves acceptable, pleasing to one and all, the offer of paris who caused our long hard campaign
as i scanned the horizon, yours were the first ships that i’d seen come ashore
obey me, all you argives
down he went, crushed by racing achilles' hands, destroyed in the river where he slaughtered other trojans too
where can he aim his rage?
he rose from his seat, not moving toward the center
and despite the god's undying lust for battle ares might have wasted away there on the spot if the monsters' stepmother, beautiful eriboea had not sent for hermes, and out of the cauldron hermes stole him away — the war-god breathing his last, all but broken down by the ruthless iron chains
who could deny your nerve there, your fighting hands?
all his paternal care is focused on his son
the old majestic priam gave his answer: dear woman, surely i wo not resist your urging now
i’ve journeyed through the course that fortune charted for me
look how they wear you out, the sons of achaea — curse them — battling round our walls!
agonizing now he probed his own great heart: why, why?
straightway rumor flies through libya’s great cities, rumor, swiftest of all the evils in the world
athenians all, and peteos' son menestheus led them on, and no one born on the earth could match that man in arraying teams of horse and shielded fighters — nestor his only rival, thanks to nestor's age
the archer sent them a bracing following wind, they stepped the mast, spread white sails wide, the wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow, sang out loud and strong as the ship made way, skimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal
they’re dazed, they’ve just debarked, they’ve got no land-legs yet!
the deathless aphrodite sank in dione's lap and her mother, folding her daughter in her arms, stroked her gently, whispered her name and asked, who has abused you now, dear child, tell me, who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling, cruel?
so aeneas says, in tears, turning back to his gates where pallas’ lifeless body lay outspread, guarded by old acoetes
but sarpedon hurled next with a flashing lance and missed his man but he hit the horse bold dancer, stabbing his right shoulder and down the stallion went, screaming his life out, shrieking down in the dust as his life breath winged away
i am on my way with a message for achilles, our great man of war — the plan that nestor, achaea's watch and ward, urged me to report
now, at this point, torn as i am with doubts, here is what i propose
with those words, fully aware, he offers up his throat to the sword and across his armor pours his life in waves of blood
just because some god exalts you in battle you think you can beat the rest at tactics too
all our argives dying there in droves!
the more he vaunted the more the river's anger rose, churning at heart for a way to halt his rampage, godlike achilles, and stop the trojans' rout
and iris racing the wind went veering off and priam ordered his sons to get a wagon ready, a good smooth-running one, to hitch the mules and strap a big wicker cradle across its frame
and there was helen of argos, sitting with all the women of the house, directing the rich embroidered work they had in hand
this maneuver will never work for them, this scheme they hatched for the moment as i raged on and on
not when i stormed europa, far-famed phoenix' daughter who bore me minos and rhadamanthys grand as gods
and now as he glanced back at achaea's troops and ships he tore out his hair by the roots, he looked to zeus on high, groaning from the depths of his proud, embattled heart
there lies my wealth, hoards of it, all i left behind when i sailed to troy on this, this insane voyage — and still more hoards from here: gold, ruddy bronze, women sashed and lovely, and gleaming gray iron, and i will haul it home, all i won as plunder
so he cried, driving them on, and all ears rang with his cries and a tight phalanx launched straight at the wall, brandishing sharp spears, swarming the bastions as hector grappled a boulder, bore it up and on
holding formation now the trojans rolled across it, apollo heading them, gripping the awesome storm-shield and he tore that argive rampart down with the same ease some boy at the seashore knocks sand castles down — he no sooner builds his playthings up, child's play, than he wrecks them all with hands and kicking feet, just for the sport of it
like shoals of fish darting before some big-bellied dolphin, escaping, cramming the coves of a good deepwater harbor, terrified for their lives — he devours all he catches — so the trojans down that terrible river's onrush cowered under its bluffs
as ajax heaved him up odysseus never missed a trick — he kicked him behind the knee, clipping the hollow, cut his legs from under him, knocked him backward — pinned as odysseus flung himself across his chest!
we’ll hunt these trojans down where victory opens up the first way in
the fourth was led by the old horseman phoenix, alcimedon led the fifth, laerces' gallant son
the troops were sleeping, weary from pitching camp, their weapons piled beside them on the ground, three neat rows of the burnished well-kept arms and beside each man his pair of battle-horses
with that sleep went drifting off to the famous tribes of men, stirring poseidon even more to defend the argives
so come, follow my orders
the greeks charged him with treason, a trumped-up charge, an innocent man, and just because he opposed the war they put him to death, but once he’s robbed of the light, they mourn him sorely
let each fighter think of his own wife, his home, remember the great works, the triumphs of our fathers
our aides will handle them — we will steer these racers straight at the trojans now, the great breakers of horses
this is the twelfth day he's lain there, too, but his body has not decayed, not in the least, nor have the worms begun to gnaw his corpse, the swarms that devour men who fall in battle
recognizing the fury’s ruffling wings at a distance, wretched juturna tears her hair, nails clawing her face, fists beating her breast, and cries to her brother: how, turnus, how can your sister help you now?
halting close beside it, he taunted fighting menelaus: back, high and mighty atrides, captain of armies — back from the corpse, and leave the bloody gear!
so he pleaded, lost in his own great innocence
fight like men, my comrades — call up your battle-fury!
not a word in reply to that from the archer-god but zeus's regal consort flew into rage at once and her outburst raked the huntress armed with arrows: how do you have the gall, you shameless bitch, to stand and fight me here?
she feared some argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out
the great man of war breaking into a broad smile, his gaze fixed on his son, in silence
oh no, when they were flung loose from their native land i dared to hunt those exiles through the breakers, battle them down the ocean far and wide
rearing, bolting in terror down the plain his horses snared themselves in tamarisk branches, splintered his curved chariot just at the pole's tip and breaking free they made a dash for the city walls where battle-teams by the drove stampeded back in panic
suddenly strange light flares from turnus’ eyes and his armor clangs, horrific, the blood-red plumes shake on his head and his shield shoots bolts of lightning
they look our way in despair, they must
he burst into tears, pleading, take me alive!
how much lighter the war would be for trojans then if you, their greatest scourge, were dead and gone!
now then, you have heard, great king, the king’s response, the view he takes of this mighty war of ours
the contingents scattered, each to its own ship
but if you long so deeply to know what we went through, to hear, in brief, the last great agony of troy, much as i shudder at the memory of it all— i shrank back in grief—i’ll try to tell it now
since all the sibyl foretold of you was true, misenus, all too true
but aeneas, taking a long, deep breath, replied, do not think for a moment, achilles, son of peleus, you can frighten me with words like a child, a fool — i am an old hand myself at trading taunts and insults
by now dank night had nearly reached her turning-point in the sky, and stretched on the hard thwarts beneath their oars the crews gave way to a deep, quiet rest, when down from the stars the god of sleep came gliding gently, cleaving the dark mists and scattering shadows, hunting you, palinurus, bringing you fatal sleep in all your innocence
or let him reign over those he’s beaten down
here is our brother eryx’ land
well, look at these alarms!
but aeneas turned and gave the god an answer: son of priam, why press me to go against achilles?
safeguard this second troy, this remnant left by the greeks and cruel achilles
well you know how to double round the post
alcimedon sprang aboard the hurtling chariot, quickly grasping the whip and reins in both fists as automedon leapt to ground
no, what lasting thanks in the long run for warring with our enemies, on and on, no end?
— and she's just returned from olympian zeus, just now
and all in an onrush dark as autumn days when the whole earth flattens black beneath a gale, when zeus flings down his pelting, punishing rains — up in arms, furious, storming against those men who brawl in the courts and render crooked judgments, men who throw all rights to the winds with no regard for the vengeful eyes of the gods — so all their rivers crest into flood spate, ravines overflowing cut the hilltops off into lonely islands, the roaring flood tide rolling down to the storm-torn sea, headlong down from the foothills washes away the good plowed worfk of men — rampaging so, the gasping trojan war-teams hurtled on
our prince of beauty — mad for women, you lure them all to ruin!
then back to her mighty father's sturdy halls she went as troops moved out, pouring out of the fast trim ships
if ever in argos' golden wheatlands one of us burned the fat thighs of sheep or bulls and begged a safe return and you promised with a nod — remember it now, olympian
three daughters are mine in my well-built halls — chrysothemis and laodice and iphianassa — and he may lead away whichever one he likes, with no bride-price asked, home to peleus' house
and the trojan front shrank back, glorious hector too as the argives yelled and dragged away the corpses, pushing on, breakneck on
there our orders say to place our gifts
to kill him too in this present bloody rampage over sarpedon's splendid body?
he dragged the heavy spear of hardened socus squelching out of his own wound and bulging shield
achilles swarms over them — they are stampeding, a terrible mauling's coming
he struck him full in the right shoulder, under the breastplate's hollow the ripping point tore deep, shearing its way through, armor splattered with blood as pandarus triumphed, shouting over tydides wildly, move up, attack, my high-hearted trojans, lash your stallions!
aeneas erupts in anger, stung by treachery now and seeing turnus’ horses swing his chariot round and speed away, over and over he calls out to jove, to the altars built for the treaty now a shambles
with that, cocking back his arm he sends the javelin whirring on and the river roars out as over the churning rapids poor camilla flies along on the whizzing shaft
just say the word—i’ll lead my prize away
if we all formed up along the ships right now, our best men picked for an ambush — that's where you really spot a fighter's mettle, where the brave and craven always show their stripes
he sank on the spot, hunched in his dear companion's arms, gasping out his life as he writhed along the ground like an earthworm stretched out in death, blood pooling, soaking the earth dark red
let bygones be bygones now
antilochus sprang, he plunged a sword in his temple and mydon, gasping, hurled from his bolted car facefirst, head and shoulders stuck in a dune a good long time for the sand was soft and deep — his lucky day — till his own horses trampled him down, down flat as antilochus lashed them hard and drove them back to achaea's waiting ranks
now closer, closing, front to front in the onset till paris sprang from the trojan forward ranks, a challenger, lithe, magnificent as a god, the skin of a leopard slung across his shoulders, a reflex bow at his back and battle-sword at hip and brandishing two sharp spears tipped in bronze he strode forth, challenging all the argive best to fight him face-to-face in mortal combat
and the men obeyed the swift runner's orders
at that moment, cries— they could hear them now, a crescendo of wailing, ghosts of infants weeping, robbed of their share of this sweet life, at its very threshold too: all, snatched from the breast on that black day that swept them off and drowned them in bitter death
not one of them dared to sit for terror seized them all — the great achilles who held back from the brutal fray so long had just come blazing forth
how many fewer friends had gnawed the dust of the wide world, brought down by enemy hands while i raged on and on
tell me, sibyl, what are the punishments, why this scourging?
the god of battle is in your hands, my men
no, this fate was assigned to me in my old age
but the hearty son of anchises tests their heft, turning over and over the heavy coiling straps
yet two men there, famous fighters, antilochus flanking thrasymedes still had not caught word of patroclus' death: they thought the gallant soldier still alive, fighting trojans up on the clashing front lines
the trojans roared assent, lost in folly
just let him see menelaus, atreus' fighting son brought down by your shaft and hoisted onto his pyre, mourned with grief and tears!
and then you will learn your entire race to come and the city walls that will be made your own
now will you take me to your ships or leave me here — bound and gagged right here?
but the goddess roused him on, her eyes blazing: true son of tydeus, diomedes, joy of my heart!
oh if only the gods loved him as much as i do
down on the trojan front he swept like something superhuman and now from his deep whirls the river roared to phoebus, disgrace — god of the silver bow and born of zeus!
a crier put a staff in his hands and called for silence
now aeneas, standing high astern, no sooner catches a glimpse of his own trojan camp than he quickly hoists his burnished, brazen shield in his left hand
dogs and vultures would eat his fallen corpse at once!
nothing among the greeks, no place at all
nearby, there’s procas, pride of the trojan people, then come capys, numitor, and the one who revives your name, silvius aeneas, your equal in arms and duty, famed, if he ever comes to rule the alban throne
who has words to capture that night’s disaster, tell that slaughter?
i am all alone, defend me!
but marshal agamemnon called out to the armies, hear me now, you trojans, dardans, trojan allies!
but young ascanius, deep in the valley, rides his eager mount and relishing every stride, outstrips them all, now goats, now stags, but his heart is racing, praying— if only they’d send among this feeble, easy game some frothing wild boar or a lion stalking down from the heights and tawny in the sun
and achilles sprang up with a start and staring wide, drove his fists together and cried in desolation, ah god!
indeed, an age will come, as the long years slip by, when assaracus’ royal house will quell achilles’ homeland, brilliant mycenae too, and enslave their people, rule defeated argos
mestor the indestructible, troilus, passionate horseman and hector, a god among men — no son of a mortal man, he seemed a deathless god's
we are the gods, with you at the helm, who crossed the billowing sea in ships
and the argives wheeled and gave ground quickly
they have bucklers to shield their left side, sickle-swords for combat, cut-and-thrust
boasting you would face achilles man-to-man in battle!
fight it out with each other, duel before the troops!
landing, we just begin to admire apollo’s city when king anius, king of men and priest of the god, his brow wreathed with the bands and holy laurel leaves, comes to meet us, spotting a long-lost friend, anchises
and you too, your fate awaits you too, godlike as you are, achilles — to die in battle beneath the proud rich trojans' walls!
but let's trade armor
priam must not see his son
urging so, but at first the women wavered, looking back at the ships with hateful glances, torn between their hapless love for the land they stood on now and the fated kingdom, calling still—when all at once the goddess towered into the sky on balanced wings, cleaving a giant rainbow, flying beneath the clouds
as a stallion full-fed at the manger, stalled too long, breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain, out for his favorite plunge in a river's cool currents, thundering in his pride — his head flung back, his mane streaming over his shoulders, sure and sleek in his glory, knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves — so hector hurtled on, his legs driving, his knees pumping, spurring his reinsmen once he heard the god's command
look at the power they display and the oakleaf civic crowns that shade their foreheads
all the lookout peaks stand out and the jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from the high heavens bursts the boundless bright air and all the stars shine clear and the shepherd's heart exults — so many fires burned between the ships and the xanthus' whirling rapids set by the men of troy, bright against their walls
so turnus blazes up into full explosive fury, bursting out at the king with reckless words: turnus spurns all delay!
so he threatened but the dogs were not about to feed on hector
versatile odysseus took the helm as captain
his own huge spear— the fighter luckily bore it in his grip— rugged with knots, the oakwood charred hard
the king himself pitched in with the lead heralds, summoning troops
come, tell me the truth now, point by point
as thick as leaves in autumn woods at the first frost that slip and float to earth, or dense as flocks of birds that wing from the heaving sea to shore when winter’s chill drives them over the waves to landfalls drenched in sunlight
as crimson as indian ivory stained with ruddy dye or white lilies aglow in a host of scarlet roses, so mixed the hues that lit the young girl’s face
as a burly farmhand wielding a whetted ax, chopping a field-ranging bull behind the horns, hacks through its whole hump and the beast heaves up then topples forward — so aretus reared, heaving up then toppled down on his back
how on earth can a man rage on forever?
that was all, and patroclus armed himself in achilles' gleaming bronze
pity the son and father, i pray you, kindly lady!
brave patroclus first — just as areilycus swerved in sudden flight he gored him in the hip with a slashing spear and the bronze lancehead hammered through his flesh, the shaft splintering bone as he pitched face-first, pounding the ground — and veteran menelaus wounded thoas, raking his chest where the shield-rim left it bare, and loosed his limbs — and amphiclus went for meges but meges saw him coming and got in first by far, spearing him up the thigh where it joins the body, the spot where a man's muscle bunches thickest: the tough sinews shredded around the weapon's point as the dark swirled down his eyes — nestor's sons on attack!
your old affection for your people?
our team could race with the rush of the west wind, the strongest, swiftest blast on earth, men say — still you are doomed to die by force, achilles, cut down by a deathless god and mortal man!
close range too, hector stabbed the wrist of leitus, brave alectryon's son, and knocked him out of action
what noble parents produced so fine a daughter?
no one may pass below the secret places of earth before he plucks the fruit, the golden foliage of that tree
it's no longer ghastly war for troy and achaea — now, i tell you, the argives fight the gods!
they made three rapid charges, three lunges and then — ajax stabbed through tydides' round balanced shield but failed to reach his flesh — saved by the breastplate just behind the buckler!
what bad luck — to snatch this curved bow off its peg that day i marched my trojans hard to your lovely town of troy, to please prince hector
and with that threat he called out to his horses, golden and whitefoot, blaze and silver flash!
a flash of his helmet as rangy hector shook his head: ajax, royal son of telamon, captain of armies, do not toy with me like a puny, weak-kneed boy or a woman never trained in works of war!
next laocoön rushing quick to the rescue, clutching his sword— they trap him, bind him in huge muscular whorls, their scaly backs lashing around his midriff twice and twice around his throat—their heads, their flaring necks mounting over their victim writhing still, his hands frantic to wrench apart their knotted trunks, his priestly bands splattered in filth, black venom and all the while his horrible screaming fills the skies, bellowing like some wounded bull struggling to shrug loose from his neck an axe that’s struck awry, to lumber clear of the altar
all else is just as your mother promised
but the goddess venus, lustrous among the cloudbanks, bearing her gifts, approached and when she spotted her son alone, off in a glade’s recess by the frigid stream, she hailed him, suddenly there before him: look, just forged to perfection by all my husband’s skill: the gifts i promised!
one love bound them, side by side they’d rush to attack, so now, standing the same watch, they held one gate
they flung wine from their cups and wet the earth and no fighter would dare drink until he would poured an offering out to the overwhelming son of cronus
patroclus, over against him, leapt down from his car and hit the ground, his left hand shaking a spear and seized with his right a jagged, glittering stone his hand could just cover — patroclus flung it hard, leaning into the heave, not backing away from hector, no, and no wasted shot
you want these trojans to pin you against your high sterns beached in the surf?
there is a country— the greeks called it hesperia, land of the west, an ancient land, mighty in war and rich in soil
one girl, chryseis, the fiery-eyed achaeans ferry out in a fast trim ship to chryse island, laden with presents for the god
you heart of iron!
not waiting for welcome the running god of luck went straight up to priam, clasped the old king's hands and asked him warmly, father — where do you drive these mules and team through the godsent night while other mortals sleep?
treasures cram our house, bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything, gladly, priceless ransom — if only he learns i am still alive in argive ships!
plenty of words there are, all kinds at its command — with all the room in the world for talk to range and stray
i blame no one
but hector seeing his own brother polydorus clutching his entrails, sinking limp to the ground — the mist came swirling down his eyes as well
what insanity shifts my fixed resolve?
why tell me of all that i must do?
oh would to god that i could sink my teeth in his liver, eat him raw!
as his rival passed the red-haired captain cursed him: antilochus — no one alive more treacherous than you!
but when they spun their appeals before us all, menelaus spoke out quickly — his words racing, few but clear as a bell, nothing long-winded or off the mark, though in fact the man was younger
so vultures will eat them raw, their firm young flesh, and we, we will drag their dear wives and helpless children back to the beaked ships, once we have seized their city!
the horns on its head ran sixteen hands in length and a bowyer good with goat-horn worked them up, fitted, clasped them tight, sanded them smooth and set the golden notch-rings at the tips
so that now the duty's ours — we are the ones to head our lycian front, brace and fling ourselves in the blaze of war, so a comrade strapped in combat gear may say, 'not without fame, the men who rule in lycia, these kings of ours who eat fat cuts of lamb and drink sweet wine, the finest stock we have
fourteen rutulians are picked to guard the ramparts, each commanding a hundred troops, their helmets crested with purple plumes, their war-gear glinting gold
teucer came to sidon once, banished from native ground, searching for new realms, and my father belus helped him
wherever i look, no use, i cannot see the achaean for the mission, such swirling mist blots out the men and horses both
well, once again i am bound to say what i think best
— words still on my lips as he groans in answer: the last day has come for the trojan people, no escaping this moment
or follow you on the run, once i have given the captains your command?
far better then, not now, with the enemy camped before our walls
a month — but look at us
all italy blazed— until that instant all unstirred, inert
i blaze for battle — your taunts ca not turn me back, not till we have fought it out with bronze
and how could hector have fled the fates of death so long?
with his last words he turned in his tracks and went his way
and a powerful, huge man loomed up at once, panopeus' son epeus, the famous boxing champion
why are you cowering here, skulking out of range?
she’d speak her heart but her voice chokes, mid-word
where have i come from?
ah, but little by little a lesser, tarnished age came stealing in, filled with the madness of war, the passion for possessions
hephaestus the master craftsman rose up first to harangue them all, trying now to bring his loving mother a little comfort, the white-armed goddess hera: oh disaster
a swift dark glance and the headstrong runner answered, hector, stop!
till abruptly she cries out in a blaze of fury: no goddess was your mother!
and now their entire army settled down to supper but all night long the argives raised patroclus' dirge
what are your ears for, ares, ca not you hear the truth?
book twelve: the trojans storm the rampart
take them with you as comrades in your fortunes
but zeus turned to hera, his wife and sister, saying, so, my ox-eyed queen, you have had your way at last, setting the famous runner achilles on his feet
that brought his brother's warrior spirit round
and dionysus was terrified, he dove beneath the surf where the sea-nymph thetis pressed him to her breast — dionysus numb with fear: shivers racked his body, thanks to the raucous onslaught of that man
out it flared, the fire inside my soul, my rage ablaze to avenge our fallen country—pay helen back, crime for crime
i will find a way to protect him from those swarms, the vicious flies that devour men who fall in battle
signs from my father’s shrine and a host of omens from the skies forbid me to wed her to a bridegroom chosen from our race
nearby, his brazen helmet swings from a branch and his heavy armor lies on the grass, in peace
or if glory spurs you on, if your strength is still like oak, if the dowry of a palace seems so very dear to your heart, courage!
here vulcan pounded out the salii, dancing priests of mars, the luperci, stripped, their peaked caps wound with wool, bearing their body-shields that dropped from heaven, and chaste matrons, riding in pillowed coaches, led the sacred marches through the city
apollo son of zeus encouraged him still more: hero, why not invoke the deathless gods yourself?
and along came two aides of ares limping in, the battle-hard tydides flanked by good odysseus leaning on their spears, still bearing painful wounds, and slowly found their seats in the front ranks
but lord apollo the distant deadly archer reassured him: courage!
to the rest i would pass on this advice: sail home now!
once before he chased me hard with his spear, down from ida the day he raided our flocks and sacked lyrnessus, pedasus fort as well
no spear rages now in the hand of diomedes, keen to save the argives from disaster
i am the river tiber
a friend lies dead—oh, you could not know— his body pollutes your entire fleet with death while you search on for oracles, linger at our doors
just so one more glory can crown these trojans — god help us, they have beaten us already — and the scales of headlong death can drag us down
come, grant the trojans victory after victory till the achaean armies pay my dear son back, building higher the honor he deserves!
her eyes wide, queen hera shuddered before his thunder, protesting, swearing a flight of winged oaths: earth be my witness now, the vaulting sky above and the dark cascading waters of the styx — i swear by the greatest, grimmest oath that binds the happy gods!
at last, at last i leave the field of battle
zeus who rules the world has ripped his wits away
so they waited, the old chiefs of troy, as they sat aloft the tower
zeus the king of the clouds has pitched on victory for the trojans, not for us
we were both there inside, i and prince odysseus heard it all in the halls, all your father told you
not even if i should learn of my own father's death, who, this moment, is weeping warm tears in phthia, i know it, bereft of a son as loved as this
— because menelaus has beaten your handsome paris and hateful as i am, he longs to take me home?
leave patroclus now to the best men you can find, they will straddle the corpse and fight off trojan packs — you fight the fatal day from us, we are still alive
whenever the senate’s called, you’re first to show your face
she’d still be one of my loyal comrades, still my own dear girl
but come, tell me the truth now, point by point: this treasure — a king's ransom — do you send it off to distant, outland men, to keep it safe for you?
yet jove would not allow those fighters to clash; he saved each man for his own fate, soon now, under a stronger foe
the gods are so much stronger
now, i suppose, the myrmidon captains cringe before the phrygian armies, now diomedes, now larisaean achilles, and aufidus’ rapids rush back from the adriatic’s waves!
as soon as the roasts were done and spread on platters, patroclus brought the bread, set it out on the board in ample wicker baskets
he halts, grasps his bow and his flying arrows, the weapons his trusty aide achates keeps at hand
the other glistens with ivory, radiant, flawless, but through it the dead send false dreams up toward the sky
i’ll state my case in a few words
first he shot into flames and burned the plain, ignited hordes of corpses, squads achilles slaughtered — he scorched the whole plain and the shining river shrank
but all the while my blood runs cold with fear — menoetius' fighting son
a small comfort offered a grief so great but owed to a father’s heartache
but if red-haired menelaus brings down paris, the trojans surrender helen and all her treasures
such service earns such gifts
and so with a few words she turned to barce, sychaeus’ old nurse—her own was now black ashes deep in her homeland lost forever: dear old nurse, send anna my sister to me here
death-cries hit the skies!
the harbors, the battlements planned to block attack, all work’s suspended now, the huge, threatening walls with the soaring cranes that sway across the sky
he said no more
only at chariot-racing the sons of actor beat me — two against one, cutting before me, hellbent to win, for the biggest prize was left for the last event
under his huge weight the earth quakes, his limbs fall limp, his armor splattered with brains, he sprawls on the ground in death—in perfect halves over both his shoulders, right and left, his head goes lolling free
enough terror, juno counters, treachery too
our parents — one pair or the other will mourn a dear son today
and there he lay in the whirling dust, overpowered in all his power and wiped from memory all his horseman's skills
already up on the heights— turn around and look—there’s pallas holding the fortress, flaming out of the clouds, her savage gorgon glaring
when the tenth dawn shone with her rose-red fingers, he began to question him, asked to see his credentials, whatever he brought him from his in-law, proetus
men call it thicket ridge, the immortals call it the leaping amazon myrine's mounded tomb, and there the trojans and allies ranged their troops for battle
this strife, this warfare plaguing all the immortals — hera's all to blame!
where are you headed?
automedon rushed in, wild as the god of war to strip the armor off, shouting in savage exultation, now, by heaven, i have eased the grief of patroclus' ghost a little — though the man i battered down was half as great as he!
and you — the dogs and birds will maul you, shame your corpse while achaeans bury my dear friend in glory!
peleus loved me as a father loves a son, i tell you, his only child, the heir to his boundless wealth, he made me a rich man, he gave me throngs of subjects, i ruled the dolopes, settling down on phthia's west frontier
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps, and next he strapped the breastplate round his chest that cinyras gave him once, a guest-gift long ago
he steadied his balanced shield before his chest, aimed his spear at the man and flung this challenge: surely you must have hoped with all your heart — the great glorious achilles — that you would raze the proud trojans' city this very day!
as thunder at times will split the sky and a trail of fire goes rippling through the clouds, flashing, blinding light— and his wife sensed it all, delighting in her bewitching ways, she knew her beauty’s power
then he sponged off his brow and both burly arms, his massive neck and shaggy chest, pulled on a shirt and grasping a heavy staff, hephaestus left his forge and hobbled on
and so, free of fate’s demand, since they are sworn to a foreign leader now, under the will of god the etruscans set sail
and here are troops of men who had suffered wounds, fighting to save their country, and those who had been pure priests while still alive, and the faithful poets whose songs were fit for phoebus; those who enriched our lives with the newfound arts they forged and those we remember well for the good they did mankind
now, come, you sons of achaea, raise a song of triumph!
there are twin gates of war—so they are called— consecrated by awe and the dread of savage mars, closed fast by a hundred brazen bolts and iron strong forever, nor does janus the watchman ever leave the threshold
the sprinting abantes followed hard at his heels, their forelocks cropped, hair grown long at the back, troops nerved to lunge with their tough ashen spears and slash the enemies' breastplates round their chests
she broke from a cresting wave at first light and soaring up to the broad sky and mount olympus, found the son of cronus gazing down on the world, peaks apart from the other gods and seated high on the topmost crown of rugged ridged olympus
make a mockery of myself, go back to my old suitors, tempt them to try again?
and let us draft a treaty, just in every term, and invite the trojans in to share our kingdom
now, perhaps you’ve caught some rumor of palamedes, belus’ son, and his shining fame that rings in song
with camilla down, the melee peaks to a new pitch, the masses surging forward, the whole trojan army, etruscan captains, evander’s arcadian wings
what you see is your enemy’s camp—you can’t escape!
eyes lowered, her voice subdued, she murmured: she was the one, the happiest one of all, priam’s virgin daughter doomed to die at our enemy’s tomb—achilles— under the looming walls of troy
book nine: the embassy to achilles
so on the trojans came, waves in the vanguard, waves from the rear, closing, bronze men glittering, following captains, closing and hector led the way, a match for murderous ares — priam's son holding his balanced shield before him, tough with oxhides, studded thick with bronze and round his temples the flashing helmet shook
so a knowing seer of the gods would read this omen, someone clear in his mind and skilled with signs, a man the trojan armies would obey
but grief bore down on hector, packing his dark heart as he scanned the battle lines and saw the worst at once: the two men there, one stripping the gleaming armor, the other sprawled on the ground, blood still spurting warm from his slashed throat
tense but no great fear
that is my prayer, my final cry—i pour it out with my own lifeblood
urgings over, out of the gates he strode, immense in strength, waving his massive spear
we no longer gazed in wonder at his looks
in from the blind side he came — agamemnon never saw him — tensed with a spear and slashed him under the elbow, down the forearm — a glint of metal — the point ripped through his flesh and the lord of fighting men atrides shuddered
let him allow us to speak and quit his puffed-up pride, that man whose unholy leadership and twisted ways— oh, i’ll let loose, he can threaten me with death!— so many leading lights among us he’s snuffed out that we see our entire city plunged in grief while he, trusting that he can break and run, attacks the trojans, terrorizing the heavens with his spears!
through so many hard straits, so many twists and turns our course holds firm for latium
mother bore me — even me — not to be a coward through and through
his armor's heaped on the green field but the man keeps ranging the ranks of fighters like a ram — yes, he looks to me like a thick-fleeced bellwether ram making his way through a big mass of sheep-flocks, shining silver-gray
ignite the pyre beneath your luckless dead
but go i shall
within the palace all is decked with adornments, lavish, regal splendor
no one should ever let such nonsense pass his lips, no one with any skill in fit and proper speech — and least of all yourself, a sceptered king
with that vow his mother went away and left him there, alone, his heart inflamed for the sashed and lovely girl they would wrenched away from him against his will
aeneas came to a halt and wept, and oh, achates, he cried, is there anywhere, any place on earth not filled with our ordeals?
i have lost my father
nastes led the carians wild with barbarous tongues, men who held miletus, phthires' ridges thick with timber, maeander's currents and mount mycale's craggy peaks
at last, when the sun's fiery light had set, each immortal went to rest in his own house, the splendid high halls hephaestus built for each with all his craft and cunning, the famous crippled smith
the envoys had barely closed when a troubled groan came murmuring from the italians’ anxious lips and mounted as when the rocks resist a stream in spate and the dammed-up tide goes churning, sounding out as it beats from bank to bank with water roaring white
others were finishing off the dreaded aegis donned by pallas athena blazing up in arms— outdoing themselves with burnished gilded scales, with serpents coiling, writhing around each other, the gorgon herself, the severed head, the rolling eyes, the breastplate forged to guard the goddess’ chest
with that he strode away, a god in the wars of men
the day of infamy soon came
beside him, his son, lausus, second in build and beauty to latian turnus alone: lausus, breaker of horses, hunter of wild game
first to march to war is brutal mezentius, scorner of gods, fresh from the tuscan coasts to deploy his troops for battle
but this achilles — first he slaughters hector, he rips away the noble prince's life then lashes him to his chariot, drags him round his beloved comrade's tomb
all for him we have come, we’ve sailed across the mighty streams of hell
then, they say, ascanius shot for the first time in war the flying arrow he’d saved till now for wild game, routing, terrorizing them, now his bow-hand cut down strong numanus—remulus by family name, just lately bound in marriage to turnus’ younger sister
so the armies met his challenge
yanking out his ashen shaft from your body, back he dashed and lost himself in the crowds — the man would not stand up to patroclus here in mortal combat, stripped, defenseless as he was
and any charioteer who reaches trojan chariots, thrust your spear from your own car, do not throw it!
he was barely out of sight and about to range the plain when captain aeneas, moving through the exposed pass, climbs the ridge and comes forth from the shady woods
but hector ignored the argive masses, killing none, he lashed his pounding stallions straight at patroclus
porsenna, there, commanding romans to welcome banished tarquin back, mounted a massive siege to choke the city—aeneas’ heirs rushing headlong against the steel in freedom’s name
why waste time with talk when the wind is rising?
achilles sprang to his feet, he seemed startled, clasped the two of us by the hand and led us in — he pressed us to take a seat and set before us sumptuous stranger's fare, the stranger's right
so all can reap the benefits of their king — so even mighty atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace achilles, the best of the achaeans!
inside the walls, my boy!
tydides reared and hurled himself again and again, trying to kill aeneas, strip his famous armor
have all trojans and argives take their seats, and you, you challenge achaea's bravest man to duel in bloody combat to the death
there was a world
the first young squadron parades along in triumph led by little priam, who bore his forebear’s name— your noble son, polites, destined to sire italians— riding a thracian stallion dappled white, his pasterns white and prancing, high brow flashing a blaze of white
but he hit his driver — a bastard son of famed king priam, cebriones yanking the reins back taut — right between the eyes
as aeneas and menelaus came within arm's reach, waving whetted spears in each other's faces, nerved to fight it out, antilochus rushed in, tensing shoulder-to-shoulder by his captain now — and aeneas shrank from battle, fast as he was in arms, when he saw that pair of fighters side-by-side, standing their ground against him
it’s too late now for rising up with your groundless accusations—flinging empty slander in my face!
no, let an aide attend you here while i rush back to achilles, spur him into combat
there at the outer gates she met them face-to-face and blocked their path, sounding zeus's orders: where are you rushing now?
adrestus hugged his knees and begged him, pleading, take me alive, atrides, take a ransom worth my life!
find him she did, lycaon's skilled, fearless son, standing by, flanked by the bands of shielded men who would trooped with him from aesepus' dark rapids
but if i get home again and set my eyes on my native land, my wife and my fine house with the high vaulting roof, let some stranger cut my head off then and there if i do not smash this bow and fling it in the fire — the gear i packed is worthless as the wind
there will come a dawn or sunset or high noon when a man will take my life in battle too — flinging a spear perhaps or whipping a deadly arrow off his bow
the father, still bent on plaguing the argives and trojans both with wounds and groans in the bloody press of battle
all their fateful oracles—words from the gods these phrygians bandy about—alarm me not at all
and now, as all the achaean armies massed together, the swift runner achilles rose among them, asking, agamemnon — was it better for both of us, after all, for you and me to rage at each other, raked by anguish, consumed by heartsick strife, all for a young girl?
night had fallen and sleep embraced all living things on earth
now back in their tracks the trojans fled pell-mell while hera spread dense cloud ahead to block their way
he aimed and hurled and his spear's long shadow flew and hit aretus square in the balanced round shield — no blocking the shaft, the bronze rammed through, piercing his belt and gouging down his belly
not a thought in your heads for works of battle
but swayed by the fates, i have my doubts
oh give me your hand — i beg you with my tears!
closing quickly, coming head-to-head the son and the son's son of zeus who marshals storms, tlepolemus opened up to taunt his enemy first: sarpedon, master strategist of the lycians, what compels you to cringe and cower here?
approaching the god who shakes the earth, sleep sent a winged urging: fight for the argives now with all your might!
if only i could hide him away from pain and death, that day his grim destiny comes to take achilles, as surely as glorious armor shall be his, armor that any man in the world of men will marvel at through all the years to come — whoever sees its splendor
victory goes to both
turnus comes, a match for trojans and latins both!
on that warm note latinus picks out horses from his entire stable: three hundred strong, standing sleek in their lofty stalls
mourn for his honor forged of old, his sword arm never conquered in battle
whose gear could i wear?
the swelling rage of the gods has died away
menoetius' gallant son, my headstrong friend!
so come, the glory that will follow the sons of troy through time, your children born of italian stock who wait for life, bright souls, future heirs of our name and our renown: i will reveal them all and tell you of your fate
she stood in front of the horses, crying up at priam, here, quickly — pour a libation out to father zeus!
but now phoenician dido has him in her clutches, holding him back with smooth, seductive words, and i fear the outcome of juno’s welcome here
ilioneus heaving a rock, a huge crag of a rock, brings down lucetius just assaulting the gates with a flaming torch in hand as liger kills emathion, asilas lays out corynaeus, one adept with javelin, one with arrows blindsiding in from a distance— caeneus kills ortygius—turnus, triumphant caeneus— turnus cuts down itys, clonius, dioxippus and promolus, sagaris, idas, posted out in front of the steepest towers, and capys kills privernus
smoldering at the father, seized with wild resentment
oh the torment — never-ending heartbreak!
aconteus, hurled off, drops like a lightning bolt or a dead weight shot forth from a siege engine, heaving headlong far away from his charger, gasping out his life breath on the winds
no word or work of mine — nothing can be revoked, there is no treachery, nothing left unfinished once i bow my head to say it shall be done
he sounds like a man cut off and overpowered, mauled by trojan ranks in the rough assault
her gaze wavering into the high skies, she looked for a ray of light and when she glimpsed it, moaned
death cut him short
breaking into a smile the cool tactician laughed, by god, what heroic gifts you set your heart on — the great achilles' team!
but you go in yourself and clasp achilles' knees, implore him by his father, his mother with lovely hair, by his own son — so you can stir his heart!
in oilean ajax' charge came forty long black ships, locrians living across the straits from sacrosanct euboea
rescue the men of troy and the trojan women — do not hand the great glory to peleus' son, bereft of your own sweet life yourself
and you must hug it close as you haul your team and chariot round but you in your tight-strung car, you lean to the left yourself, just a bit as you whip your right-hand horse, hard, shout him on, slacken your grip and give him rein
now, my king, the achaeans are bent on making you a disgrace in the eyes of every man alive
you — forever faithless!
a gust of the north wind blowing round him carried back the life breath he had gasped away in pain
but when he let loose that great voice from his chest and the words came piling on like a driving winter blizzard — then no man alive could rival odysseus!
and no force in the world can stop evander now
i will say it outright
filled with anger zeus who marshals the storm clouds answered her at last: disaster
so many sons he slaughtered, just coming into bloom
with that challenge entellus stripped his pleated cloak from his shoulders, baring his great sinewy limbs, his great bones and joints, and stood gigantic in the center of the ring
perhaps they never crossed over from lacedaemon's lovely hills or come they did, sailing here in the deep-sea ships, but now they refuse to join the men in battle, dreading the scorn, the curses hurled at me
then the almighty father, power that rules the world, begins, and as he speaks the lofty house of the gods falls silent, earth rocks to its roots, the heights of the sky are hushed and the western breezes drop and the ocean calms its waters into peace: so then, take what i say to heart and stamp it in your minds
but now i see the soldier facing unequal odds, his day of doom, his enemy’s blows approaching
beaten twice in major battles, our city walls can scarcely harbor italy’s future hopes
now he’s buckled his breastplate, gleaming, ruddy bronze with its bristling metal scales—encased his legs in gold, his temples still bare, but his sword was strapped to his side as down from the city heights he speeds in a flash of gold in all his glory, in all his hopes already locked fast with the enemy—wild as a stallion bolting the paddock, burst free of the reins at last he commands the open plain, making for pasture, out for the herds of mares or keen for a plunge in the river runs he knows so well, he charges off, his proud head flung back, neighing, racing on, reveling in himself, his mane sporting over his neck and shoulders
but a god checked my anger, he warned me of what the whole realm would say, the loose talk of the people, rough slurs of men — they must not call me a father-killer, our achaeans!
if only fortune crowns your proposal with success!
rearing to full height, sword high, the steel hacks the brows, splitting the temples— gruesome wound—and it cleaves the soft unshaven cheeks
the dark branches, the heft of the plunder, all weigh down euryalus—fear leads him astray in the tangled paths
the ones marked out by the rascal we just killed
he used to graze his shambling herds in percote, long ago when the enemy's forces stood far off but once the rolling ships of achaea swept ashore, home he came to troy where he shone among the trojans, living close to priam, who prized him like his sons
dardanus, first and founding father of ilium, came to the land of troy
then away in his ship's stern odysseus stowed the bloody gear of dolon, in pledge of the gift they would sworn to give athena
there she fell in with sleep, twin brother of death, clung to his hand and urged him, called his name: sleep, master of all gods and all mortal men, if you ever listened to me in the old days, do what i ask you now — and you shall have my everlasting thanks
here’s the reply the phrygians, twice enslaved, return to you rutulians!
go back and tell him all, all i say — out in the open too — so other achaeans can wheel on him in anger if he still hopes — who knows?
or if the light of life has left you, where’s my hector now?
no other man would drink the shining wine from its glowing depths, nor would achilles pour the wine to any other god, none but father zeus
i’ve stained your name, my son, with my own crimes, detested, drummed from my fathers’ scepter and their throne!
artemis, flashing her golden reins, cut her down in anger
flashing hector's far in the lead, wild to drag it off, furious to lop the head from its soft, tender neck and stake it high on the city's palisade
still senseless after they propped him in their corner, and they had to fetch the two-eared cup themselves
i was the first trojan, first of the famous allies to spear patroclus down in the last rough charge
one, they say, is called the gate of horn and it offers easy passage to all true shades
ajax rose in fury to trade him taunt for taunt, and now the two of them might have come to blows if achilles himself had not stood up to calm them: enough!
as latinus ended, ilioneus followed: king, great son of faunus, no black gales, no stormy seas have swept us here to your country, nor did the stars or landmarks throw us far off course
so he pressed the point, then took his seat
no, your son, believe me— since anguish is gnawing at you, i will tell you more, unrolling the scroll of fate to reveal its darkest secrets
but you — with enemy war cries ringing in your ears — you lacked the nerve to go up against great ajax, that fierce heart, to look him straight in the eye and fight the man head-on — he's a better man than you!
around them flocked a retinue, crowds of trojans and trojan women, their hair unbound in the mourners’ way
here the elders slaughtered rams, then sat to dine at an endless line of trestles
and groaning deeply the matchless runner answered, o dear mother, true!
then the burnished greaves of electrum, smelted gold, the spear and the shield, the workmanship of the shield, no words can tell its power
laughing, ready with his reply, the prince mocks the prophet: so, a fleet’s sailed into the tiber
so we made our way back home, hearts smoldering, furious for the sum he swore but never paid — and that, that is the one whose men you favor now
let it graze a man — my weapon works in a flash and drops him dead
so achilles wept as he burned his dear friend's bones, dragging himself around the pyre, choked with sobs
say that trojans and argives both agreed to swear a truce, to seal their oaths in blood, and opposing sides were tallied out in full: count one by one the trojans who live in troy but count our achaeans out by ten-man squads and each squad pick a trojan to pour its wine — many achaean tens would lack their steward then!
but then, when the tenth night came on me, black as pitch, i burst the doors of the chamber bolted tight and out i rushed, i leapt the walls at a bound, giving the slip to guards and women servants
but i would escort you with all the kindness in my heart, all the way till i reached the shining hills of argos bound in a scudding ship or pacing you on foot — and no marauder on earth, scorning your escort, would dare attack you then
but you, euryalus, you who outstrip me by a year, i admire you, i receive you with all my heart, through thick and thin embrace you as my comrade
pity me in my own right, remember your own father!
the old horseman peleus urging his son achilles, 'now always be the best, my boy, the bravest, and hold your head up high above the others
turning over the work to you alone
but the trojans—no exceptions, hallowed tree that it was— chopped down its trunk to clear the spot for combat
then aeneas was truly overwhelmed by the vision, stunned, his hackles bristle with fear, his voice chokes in his throat
but if they have followed the oracles laid down by the gods on high and the great shades below, how can anyone overturn your edicts now and plant the fates anew?
now they would have attacked with swords, close-up, incensed, but the two aeantes drove a wedge between them, plowing through the press at their comrade's call
so ajax slowly drew back from the trojans, spirits dashed, and much against his will, fearing the worst for achaea's waiting ships
all adrift till one steady, decisive blast comes down from zeus — so the old man thrashed things out, torn two ways, to join his argives fast with chariot-teams or go and find agamemnon lord of armies
i hosted them, treated them warmly in my halls and learned the ways of both, their strategies, their traits
with that, he crowns his brows with laurel leaves and declares acestes first, the winner over all
he towers over the argives, his head, his massive shoulders!
he found him beside his black ship and shelter, stretched on a fleecy bed, his blazoned gear at hand, his shield and two long spears and burnished helmet
under the mountain ridges stood an immense mound of earth, hedged with shady ilex, the tomb of dercennus, an old laurentine king
these are the solemn honors owed the dead
oh i am swept by the furies, gales of fire!
you are a good soldier
never again will i embrace him striding home through the doors of peleus' house
at his departure he gave me a splendid quiver bristling lycian arrows, a battle-cape shot through with golden mesh, and a pair of gilded reins my son, pallas, now makes his
you will maim your team, you will smash your car to pieces
they gave applause to hector's ruinous tactics, none to polydamas, who gave them sound advice
ajax, idomeneus, trusty odysseus or you, achilles, you — the most violent man alive — so you can perform the rites for us and calm the god yourself
as the argive spun in retreat his shield-rim tripped him — down to his feet that shield he bore to keep off spears — he stumbled over it now, pitched back, helmet clanging harshly against his brows as the man hit the ground
here, on first returning to earth, he hallowed to you, apollo, the oars of his rowing wings and here he built your grand, imposing temple
but if i were now the man i was, full of the youth that spurs that bantam there, cocksure and strutting so— i’d need no bribe of a prize bull to bring me out
the locrians stranded out on libya’s coast?
but if your hands will rear it up, into your city, then all asia in arms can invade greece, can launch an all-out war right up to the walls of pelops
hearing his wish, the lord of men agamemnon dismissed the troops at once to the balanced ships
nor did the other chariot-drivers hold formation — all dismounted, seeing shining hector leap to earth
now a trusted herald, no empty rumor, wings the news to aeneas: his men stand on the razor edge of death— now is the time to rescue his routed trojans
back to the city hector sent two heralds now to bring the lambs at once and summon priam while king agamemnon sent talthybius off, heading down to the ships for one more lamb
summer has just begun when father commands us: hoist our sails to fate!
even if we can breach the argives' gates and wall, assaulting in force, and the argives give ground, back from the ships we will come, back the way we went but our battle-order ruined, whole battalions of trojans left behind and killed — the achaeans will cut us down with bronze to save their fleet!
but i tell you this, and there's anger in my threat: if ever — against my will and athena queen of armies, hera and hermes, and the god of fire hephaestus — if zeus ever spares the towering heights of troy, if he ever refuses to take her walls by force and give the argive troops resounding triumph, let zeus know this full well — the breach between us both will never heal!
swift as a golden eagle seizes a snake and towers into the sky, talons knotted round it, claws clutching fast but the wounded serpent writhes in its rippling coils, stiffens, scales bristling, hissing through its fangs as it rears its head, but all the more the eagle keeps on digging into its struggling victim, its hooked beak ripping away, its wings thrashing the air—so tarchon sweeps his kill right from the tiber’s columns, tarchon flushed with triumph
but zeus woke up, furious, flinging immortal gods about his house to hunt for me — i was the culprit, the worst of all — and out of the skies he would have sunk me in the sea, wiped me from sight, if the night had failed to save me, old night that can overpower all gods and mortal men
think how a lion, mauling the soft weak young of a running deer, clamped in his massive jaws, cracks their backbones with a snap — he's stormed in, invading the lair to tear their tender hearts out and the mother doe, even if she's close by, what can she do to save her fawns?
what course to set to master these ordeals?
