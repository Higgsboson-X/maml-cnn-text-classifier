not a soul felt any qualms before it, and it even promised occasion for entertainment and mischief
but i have been thinking about these questions lately, in the rest-cure; and i find it wonderful, i find it a simply priceless arrangement of things, that the formal, the idea of form, of beautiful form, lies at the bottom of every sort of humanistic calling

i must permit myself to remark that my time is limited, my carriage is waiting, and i am really obliged to ask for the favour of a few words with you

if it did happen to any of them, it would be a sure sign that they were not sound, but diseased, and they would not react to the appearance with emotions of horror and by taking to their heels, but treat it as though it were entirely in order, and begin a conversation with it—this being, in fact, the reaction of a person suffering from a hallucination

neither in familiarity with the features peculiar to life as lived up here—a familiarity impossible to achieve in so few days, which, as he was quite aware, and had even said to joachim, he could hardly hope to acquire in the three weeks of his stay—nor in the adaptation of his physical organism to the prevailing peculiar atmospheric conditions
if anything hit him--' certainly, my dear
his face glowed rosy-red with dry, internal heat, a sign that for this child of the lowland, bred in an atmosphere that rejoiced in a high degree of humidity, acclimatization could only consist in getting used to not getting used to it—which, in fact, rhadamanthus himself never did, being perpetually purple-cheeked

the truth was that the consul's estate was more considerable than any one had supposed
tony dropped her stocking and looked thoughtfully into armgard's face
many a turn of phrase in musician's jargon came not from the acoustic but the visual, the note-picture: for instance, one speaks of occbiali because the brol{en drum-basses, half-notes that are coupled by a stroke through their necks, look like a pair of spectacles; or as one calls cobbler's patches (rosalia) certain cheap sequences one after another in s::ages at like intervals (he wrote examples for us on the blackboard)

but out of the corner of his eye he looks - or perhaps not quite looks, perhaps his blue eyes are only the slightest shade turned from a direct gaze up at the platform and towards the corner where she stands and waits
her strongly developed family sense was instinctively hostile to conceptions of free will and self-development; it inclined her rather to recognize and accept her own characteristics wholesale, with fatalistic indifference and toleration
he will never get to be a master, poor chap!
when i came back to leipzig, once more a civilian, i found my friend unchanged in his walks and ways

and now began a festival, a triumph, an unbounded orgy of this very figure, which now displayed a wealth of dynamic colour which passed through every octave, wept and shivered in tremolo, sang, rejoiced, and sobbed in exultation, triumphantly adorned with all the bursting, linkling, foaming, purling resources of orchestral pomp

the ceremonies by which the evil one had sealed his pact with the old crone came out bit by bit under re- peated pressure, and were hair-raising
she was entirely reasonable about her own guilt and did not pretend that she had been seduced- on the contrary, carl, the chauffeur, had even said: it's no good, fraulein, better not, but it had been stronger than she was, and she had always been ready to pay with death, and would do, and being ready for death, so it seemed to her, made up for the vvhole

no, you are mistaken
never had it been filled by such reeking pipe-smoke; such unpleasantly easy manners  were foreign to it

the other day he was telling me about dynamic drugs and asiatic poison-trees; it was so interesting it was almost uncanny—interesting things are always a bit uncanny—but the interest was not so much in what he was saying as it was taken in connexion with his personality, which made it interesting and uncanny at once

tony sat down apart with another book, and herr gr� softly questioned: our book is not to your taste, fraulein?
she stood at gerda's side to receive the visits of condolence in the living-room and there was no end of these; their name was legion
we’ve come for a little visit, said hans castorp, with his eyes more on the pious horror in the corner than on the owner of the surprising room, who was expressing his gratification that the cousins had kept their word

i suppose i ave not wished for it, be- cause iny pity is too deep, my grief and sympathy are with this unhappy nation, when i think of the exaltation and blind ardour of its uprising, the breaking-out, the breaking-up, the breaking- down; the purifying and fresh start, the national new birth of ten years ago, that seemingly religious intoxication - which then be- trayed itself to any intelligent person for what it was by its crud- ity, vulgarity, gangsterism, sadism, degradation, filthiness - ah, how unmistakably it bore within itself the seeds of this whole war!

i do not under-stand--it is from berlin
such was the multiple state of life, sprung from the union of two parent cells, the association of many non-sexually originated generations of cell units; its growth meant their increase, and the generative circle came full again when sexcells, specially developed elements for the purpose of reproduction, had established themselves and found the way to a new mingling that drove life on afresh
the fact displays the inborn tendency of music to superstitious rites and observances, the sym- bolism of nulnbers and letters

i am sure i went the colour of a turkey-cock for laughing, while listening to a discussion, pursued with the same intellectual satisfaction as before, about the growing tendency of dentists to pull out forthwith all teeth with dead nerves; since it had been concluded - after a long, painstaking, and refined de- velopment in the nineteenth-century technique of root treatment - that they were to be regarded as infectious foreign bodies

i think the citizens-- then you feel lonely?
you have a conscience like a butcher's dog, and yet you are nothing but a ninny, a scapegoat
he met his brother's remonstrances with a mor-tified air, making no defence, and for a few days would apply himself with somewhat more zeal to the english correspond-ence
they had declared, the heads, in the accents of a corps-student, that they were on track of the actual causes of the instability of hans castorp’s heating economy
my dear sir, what do you think of me?
no truth may be written or taught which might not agree with the established order of things
if my conviction is worth anything, it was certainly not written after our visit to the moun- tain village or during our stay there
he had a head full of remark-able bumps, to which his blond hair clung as smooth as glass; grey eyes with black rings beneath them, and long brown buddenbrook hands that stuck out beneath the too short sleeves of his neatly brushed jacket
the gentlemen have an eloquent advocate
i know him well, have been friendly with him for a long time; he was kind enough to take me up, because he found i was a delicate child of life
how he looked, she heard, when they brought him!
i do not know how much of the situation you know or suspect
or, on the contrary, did they seem much longer than had actually been the case?
he looked at his cousin, who only shrugged indifferently with brows and shoulders, as though to say: well, what of it?
they pressed their arms to their sides, stood on their tip-toes, bent their heads, and bit their tongues in the fervour of their devotion
they describe with unearthly terror the sign of an epiphany of the god at his shrine
thus she went about in the town like a little queen; and like a queen, she was kind or cruel to her subjects, as the whim seized her
yes, but wait a bit—if you had been there, you wouldn’t have known what kind of
a spacious cabinet, like another room, was built into the wall of his dressing-room; and here, on long rows of hooks, on wooden hangers, were coats, smoking jackets, frock-coals, evening clothes, clothes for all occasions, all seasons, and all grades of formality; the care-fully creased trousers were arranged on chairs beneath
he bent over his plate, turned his head away, and looked as though he wanted to sink through the floor; and several times he interrupted her with a low, tormented good cod, tony!
she prob- ably thought that once accepted by the family, once married to henri and safe in another country, she would find ways and
it is pleasant to celebrate the past, when one is gratified with the present and the future
he sat up straight on the sofa, with one knee crossed over the other, puffed at his cigar, knit his brows a little, and mar-shalled his figures with wonderful fluency
i have had a card from munich too, from eva ewers
mynheer peeperkorn, genuinely thirsty, drank down glass after glass of the simple, effervescent drink
upon classical learning - luther had personally little enough of it - as the source of the spiritual turmoil
this was received with enthusiasm, though dr blumenkohl, whose state had now much altered for the worse, muttered something to himself, with the expression peculiar to him upon his face, or rather upon his lips; he seemed to be asking what sort of verses were these
but the rules stood in the way, and hans castorp resolved to act behind his back
nothing in them but the orsini bombs
according to programme, hans castorp drew in deep draughts of the pure morning air, the fresh, light atmosphere that breathed in so easily, that held no hint of damp, that was without associations, without content
i call it very feeble of them
only a little further— supposing one were to give way to the temptation, and his temptation was great; it was so strong that it quite lived up to the many descriptions he had read of the typical danger-state
but why so testy?
his father and pastor wunder-lich could be seen to exchange the smallest of smiles
a matter of decades?
on the previous day, the th of march, —, he was able to confirm the fact of the said calumny and detraction by the mouth of an immediate witness to the conversation in which the offensive words and insinuations had been uttered
he tried to speak, but no words came
hence our holy duty of feeling, hence the shame in unfeelingness, in powerlessness to awaken the woman to desire
here too the stove was burning merrily, behind a brass lattice
the will no longer availed
he found her excitation, or rather the expression of it, somehow unsuitable, almost offensive, in so homely and insignificant a creature
he talked a great deal, laughed without reason, struck his nephew with his fist in the pit of the stomach, shouting: hullo there, old fellow!
one does not at bottom understand that, one just accepts it as a well-bred man should, in objective respect for a law of nature - and indeed the attitude of a man is usually more tolerant and benevolent than that of a woman, who mostly casts a jealous eye on a friend who tells her a man is in love with her, even though she cares nothing at all for the man
i could not be seen with it here, you understand
obviously the system of this kingly man stood in more than common need of moistening
for the station of landquart lies at a relatively low altitude, but now the wild and rocky route pushes grimly onward into the alps themselves
thought the consul to himself, bowing as the company lifted their glasses
but / heard it, and it was a word that--a word--oh, it was that word, let me tell you, thomas, that caused me, to spend the whole night packing my trunk, to wake erica early in the morning, and to leave the place, rather than to remain in the neighbourhood of a man who could utter such words
so you think your wife is ruining you?
they were not certain half-human beings settembrini corrected him
what do you mean by that?
again he had learned that beauty can pierce one like a pain, and that it can sink profoundly into shame and a longing despair that utterly consume the courage and energy necessary to the life of every day
did he find things easier, for that?
the little one looked up at grandfather’s narrow grey head, bending over the basin
and little johann stammered, retreating, with his hand to his cheek, i thought--i thought--there was nothing else coming,
he sat straighter, higher, stiff er than ever, without touching the cushions
funny, joachim said, bending forward to look at his cousin, on herr settembrini’s farther side
music was heard; the tapir-faced lady was playing handel’s largo on the violin, and then a drawing-room sonata by grieg, characteristically northern in mood
i felt myself that the image was inapplicable to the extremes of adrian's nature, his swing between penitential paralysis and compensating creative re lease
he went on to say that in behaviour, in action, determinism did indeed rule; there was no freedom of choice
it shouts for a campaign against the fall in the birth-rate, it demands a reduction in the cost of bringing up children and training them to a profession—and meanwhile men are herded like cattle, and all the trades and professions are so overcrowded that the fight round the feeding-trough puts in the shade the horrors of past wars
i refrain from quoting it, merely characterizing it as a human document which affects the reader like the baring of a wound and whose painful lack of reserve the writer probably considered an utter- most hazard
then he listened at the patient's chest and felt his pulse
after gerda buddenbrook had watched her son a little, she decided that he must have piano lessons
but, after all, was it not best thus?
hans castorp knew, for had not those events visited himself with justifiable pangs?—even her way of turning, before she sat down, to present herself, as it were, to the room, she had as of yore
such was the announcement settembrini had made, that easter sunday
and here’s the libretto, he said, and gestured with his head toward a little case on the wall, filled with broad-backed albums
there is a case of a party of miners, buried and shut off from every possibility of knowing the passage of day or night, who told their rescuers that they estimated the time they had spent in darkness, flickering between hope and fear, to be some three days
as you grew, said jonathan to us, and you can easily prove it by feeling your elbows and ribs, you formed in your insides a solid structure, a skeleton which gives your flesh and muscles sta- bility, and which you carry round inside you - unless it be more correct to say it carries you around
the lady in front of him did, indeed, turn her head as he sat down, and measured him with narrow eyes
as your father says, you have time to consider, the frau consul continued
in my view theology cannot be mod- ern - one may reckon that to its advantage, of course - and as for symbolism, i cann,dt see why one should take hell more sym- bolically than heaven
he despised, he scorned it, and himself; but had reached the point where it obliged him, every few days, to take to his bed
leipzig, friday after purificationis  s in the peterstrasse, hozlse the th most honourable, most illustrious, learned, and \-vell-beloved magister and ballisticus!
i have been with my brother--on pressing business
ah, yes, it is well and truly dreamed
but how long, or how short, it actually is, that nobody knows
i generally take a match
after our roast fowl rudi schwerdtfeger could stand it no longer and made up his mind to let his light shine, as it says in the good book
but to continue with the most indispensable facts in my vita: my parents allowed me to attend our gymnasium, the same school where, two forms below me, adrian was taught
the knowledge of drugs possessed by the coloured races was far superior to our own
well, to arrive at the point, this young lady looked so charming as walter tell, wore her brooch and spoke her lines with such effect, that christian felt his heart swell with en-thusiasm, and tears rose to his eyes
vale, he said, and god be with you, leverklihn
but in social intercourse he was more apt than his son to draw the line rigidly and give the cold shoulder to strangers
uncle christian was the only person who did not display this grown-up arrogance
herr grunlich, on his side, bowed with deliberation, al-though one corner of his mouth seemed to go down
a little resigned curl of the lip, or a shrug of the shoulders in their blue sailor suit, would be the only answer
then everything grew quiet, the phenomena disappeared, and joachim let out his breath with a sigh
hans castorp and he sometimes made their daily round together
they passed among the hat- and coat-racks and entered the light, low-vaulted hall, where there was a buzzing of voices, a clattering of dishes, and a running to and fro of waitresses with steaming jugs
- let us not dwell on the odd circumstance, which became second nature to me, but drop it and return to buchel
true to our principle of making him out neither better nor worse than he was, we assert that he simply declined—not expressly and consciously, but quite naïvely, declined to let his judgment of his own sex be perverted by romantic considerations
the object, cried one, the other: the ego!
now dr mantelsack crossed his legs, still standing, and began to turn over the leaves of his notebook
he declared himself to the party of conservation and of life, and struck out against the decadent spirit which hid itself behind all that seraphic cant
are you making fun of me?
dr krokowski’s smile retreated as it were, lost for the moment something of its genial warmth
a belief, a given conception of the universe, an idea—in short, a will, is always in existence; which it is the task of the intellect to expound and demonstrate
at all events, the young man’s activity during these days confined itself to a visit to behrens; a consultation of which joachim was aware, the result of which he could have accurately predicted beforehand
the candles burned down slowly in their sockets
the irritation was probably the same in kind as that which coloured her feeling toward herr settembrini, the humanist and haranguer, whom she could not abide, calling him arrogant, not hu—man
there were long sums that rovnred both sides of the slate with additions, subtractions, multipli-cations, and divisions, and had to come out to zero in the end; otherwise there was a mistake, and they must hunt and hunt till they had found the little beast and exterminated him
hans castorp, on this subject, received a singular impression: it was that a certain fundamental fact of life, which is conceded the world over to be of great importance, and is the fertile theme of constant allusion, both in jest and earnest, that this fundamental fact of life bore up here an entirely altered emphasis
he was going to the wars: the rhythm changed, grew brisk and lively, dull care and sorrow might go hang!
he stood up at last, flung joachim’s coverlet on the bed, and got something out that sounded like a good-night: don’t freeze to death; call me again in the morning, his lips hardly shaping the words; then he staggered along the corridor to his own room
come here, tom, said frau permaneder uncertainly
yes, yes, she said; this is very sad, tony
well, the bad thing about it is, that erica is a little bit inclined to be melancholy
yet hans castorp found the patience-players even worse
but he always ate a good deal, out of pure self-respect, even when he was not hungry
it had contracted almost painfully at the moment when the glass door slammed, for to that moment he had looked forward with his breath coming thick and fast
then came, in a long, black procession, the slow drive through the grey, misty streets out through the burg thor, along the leafless avenue in a cold driving rain, to the ceme-tery, where the funeral march sounded behind half-bare shrubbery on the edge of the little grove, and the great sand-stone cross marked the buddenbrook family lot
he went up to gerda, who sat there alone, reading, and put out his hand
she confided in herself to hold and bind him, in her
they are in a position to build a rival railway: east holstein, neuminster, neustadt--yes, that is quite on the cards

national nation of industry, which some day can form a right and genuine european economic society
perhaps rudi would find it more understandable when he heard what he had to say
a youthful looking man with a blond pointed beard kept order down here: dr goldener, the dressy one
do you think i would carry it into court and sue my own mother, and add a public scandal to the family one?
christmas came: the first christmas without the frau consul
but my mental state is only a variant of that which, aside from cases of ordinary self-interest or extraordinary stupidity, has become the destiny of a whole people; and this destiny i am inclined to consider in the light of a unique and peculiar tragedy, even while i realize that it has been before now laid on other nations, for the sake of their o,vn and the general future, to wish for the downfall of their state
the cousins sat down on an empty bench to watch and criticize the game
his lips seemed to take a certain pleasure in forming the words
she had been in the family now for more than thirty years
he is a devotee of your vice
the gentlemen had seemed serious people to her, whereas painters were mostly a loose lot, without much feeling for the serious things of life - she did not mean the practical side, earning money and that, no, when she said serious she meant the dark side of life, its hardships and trou- bles but she did not mean to be unfair to artists: her lodgers, for instance, had been an exception to that kind of light-headed gen- try, he being a quiet, reserved sort of man, rather low-spirited if anything - and his pictures had looked like that too, the atmos- phere of the moors, and the lonely woods and meadows, yes, it was perhaps surprising that director stiglmayer should have bought one, the gloomiest of all, of course he was a financial man but maybe he had a streak of melancholy himself
there are assistant masters, you may know, and there are head masters; but never  by any chance a plain master
the buddenbrooks in broad street think she is very like him too
the trouble, a catarrh of the apex of the lung, then seemed to have been cured, and through- out the ten years that passed before the birth of her youngest, little nepomuk, ursula had been a capable wife and mother to her family, although the years of privation during and after the war took the bloom off her health
when pressed to speak, she con- fesses that this little dog is actually her own all-too-chaste daughter, who by reason of the unbending denial of her favour to a young man on fire for her had driven him to his death; and now, in punishment therefor, she has been turned into this shape and of course constantly weeps tears of despair over her doggish estate
but herr albin was inexorable
one did not feel the cold, it might have been much less, for the dryness and absence of wind deprived it of sting
i was also irritated by the presence of bullinger, the manufacturer; he ,vas legitimated only by his high income tax, but he talked dogmati- cally on the loftiest cultural themes
nothing, answered the player, with a short shake of the head, more like the gesture with which one shakes off a fly
raising her fists, she hurled her curses down on our heads, repeating three times: jechants!
they were probably all his wardrobe could boast
was such a hope, after all, entirely vain?
the frau consul, christian, clothilde, clara, and ida jungmann stood above on the landing to greet her
one always wills one’s fate
he had long ceased to be a beginner in music, that curiously cabbalistic craft, at once playful and profound, artful and austere, when he placed himself again under the guidance, direction, su- pervision of wendell kretschmar in leipzig
there was no size to the infinite; in eternity was neither duration nor change
tell me: you did not like this herr gr�
and the honey, tom, i have always considered honey one of the very best of foods
ay, answered behrens, and shrugged his shoulders
many happy returns, herr se noter, many happy--'n' one is rich 'n' great, 'n' t'other's pore-- yes, yes, grobleben, you are right, that's just how it is!
the car-riage stopped before the terrace
the classroom suddenly became full of noise and movement
in particular it did not suit frau stöhr, the skin of whose arms was too porous; such a fashion was distinctly not for her
morten, said tony, sadly
but thomas betrayed himself to his sister tony, when they said good-bye on the street one thursday evening, and she alluded to the pbppenrade harvest
but, like the other easy men of pleasure in the community, he knew how to avoid trouble by wearing the proper expression and saying the proper thing
but before september was out she had returned, saying she did not feel well at home
he never, it is true, quite reconciled himself to tristan, though he eventually carried out gerda's wish and made a very clever arrangement of the liebestod for violin and piano
what do you think--where shall we put it?
it is the end of everything, she burst out another time, in sheer despair, and flung her arms around her sister-in-law's neck with loud weeping
clara comes into pleasant connections, in any case, and the position as pastor's wife will be very suited to her temperament
but if they were, then, however impossibly small they were, they must themselves be built up, organically built up, as a law of their existence; for the conception of a living unit meant by definition that it was built up out of smaller units which were subordinate; that is, organized with reference to a higher form
and may one ask, he queried, whom, or what—you see i am all question, i ask even how to ask—whom, or what you envisage as the bringer of this—this—i repeat the word with some unwillingness—this terror?
herr settembrini duly gave him a dressing-down, and did produce a temporary reaction of the conscience, even something like a promise to steer clear in the future of such abominations
it was midsummer before he made up his mind to go
gradually he widened the sphere of his activities
there was an elderly man from somewhere in the back blocks of austria, a one-time sculptor, with white moustaches, a hooked nose and blue eyes; who had conceived a project, financial and political in its scope, and drawn it up most meticulously in a calligraphic hand, colouring the important points in sepia

hanno's and kai's conversation was in striking contrast to that which went on ardund them, among their fellows

i am no country innocent, i tell you; and the affair with babette would not have made me go off the  handle like that, just by itself
yes, i know, the brenner frontier
one and all of them, but expressly the flowers, and of these more expressly the hosts of tuberoses, were there to palliate the other aspect of death, the side which was neither beautiful nor exactly sad, but somehow almost improper—its lowly, physical side—to slur it over and prevent one from being conscious of it
hans castorp might look forward to the pleasure of seeing him
dr faustus  dear to me, one of which is the highly subjectivizing contrast  feel between the nature of the artist and that of the ordinary man
and you are an out-and-out critic and sceptic, i must say
this child, sooner than any of us, was privileged to get an insight into the drafts of the score of ariel's songs, on which adrian \-vas privately at work
and the latter answered indifferently: nothing new

father, she said--for in these conversations she never railed him papa--father, how is our affair going on?
but he was paralyzed
then, as one gets used to the place, a gradual shrinkage makes itself felt
the room was not much more than adequate, with some slight indication of middle-class amenity in the shape of a red plush cover on the square table in front of the sofa, where his books lay and he drank his breal{fast coffee
he realized at once that he had used the hard word buddenbroks instinctively to frighten her, and he added: he can work himself up again, of course
press your breast against it, as though it filled you with rapture
consequently one must take steps to warn people of what is coming and do one's best to prevent it
you rather like mixing in matters that are not harmless, but you treat them as though they were and think to find favour in the eyes of god and man
he well knew that long letters were neither asked nor expected, it being no humanistic or literary circle to which he addressed himself down there, and the replies he received were equally lacking in expansiveness
cried herr gr�, springing to his feet
i did no work saturday, because the next day was sunday; and i did no work on sunday, because it was sunday!
unconscious and tranquil, with his soft curling hair and voluminous pinafore frocks, he played in the garden by the fountain, or in the little gallery partitioned off far his use by a pillared tailing from the vestibule of the second storey--played the plays of his four and a half years--those plays whose meaning and charm no grown person can possibly grasp: which need no more than a few pebbles, or a stick of wood with a dande-lion for a helmet, since they command the pure, powerful, glowing, untaught and unintimidated fancy of those blissful years before life touches us, when neither duty nor remorse dares to lay upon us a finger's weight, when we may see, hear
everything about him was sharp: the hooked nose dominating his face, the narrow, pursed mouth, the thick, bevelled lenses of his glasses in their light frame, behind which were a pair of pale-grey eyes—even the silence he preserved, which suggested that when he broke it, his speech would be incisive and logical
even the barbaric pair at the bad russian table had taken notice of the day: he by exchanging his leather jacket for a short coat, and the felt boots for leather shoes; she, though she still wore the soiled feather boa, by putting on a green silk blouse with a neck-ruche
frau hagenstrbm whispered to frau sena-tor mbllendorpf
you’ll get off by the autumn, the old un has more or less committed himself to that
told of her respectable, tiresome husband, her no less respectable and tiresome children, who were precisely like their father, and for whom she had not been able to feel great warmth of affection; of the half boy, half man with whom she had fled, whose poetic tenderness she never tired of describing
a man could know that and recognize freedom above and beyond all critique
so well-read a girl, one might say psychologically trained, keeping watch with a poet's eye upon her own experiences must certainly have had an insight into the growth of her own feeling - however surprising, yes, un- believable the development might have seemed to her at first
they even went abroad together, took walks with herr ferge and wehsal, naphta and settembrini, those opposed spirits, whom they could hardly fail to meet
there did not lacl{ much for their zeal in destroying the things of the spirit - a zeal that is entirely foreign to the masses - to have made sacrifice of the works of the hero of these pages, adrian leverktihn
the october terminus had slipped by and no man named it, neither the hofrat nor the cousins between themselves
the youthful listener would perceive the distinction, even the opposition, between foreign and domestic freedom; also note the ticklish question, which unfreedom was soonest—he he!—which least compatible with a nation’s honour
to put it briefly, my father had, before my sister's mar-riage, a round sum of nine hundred thousand marks net, not counting, of course, real estate, and the stock and good will of the firm
said hans castorp, taken aback, and still seated
the troublesome child—that i have been for you, in your capacity as pedagogue—you remember, you came to speak of that on the first day we met, it is one of the associations you have taught me, the relation between humanism and pedagogy; and there are many others i shall think of as time goes on
but on the whole i must say i find it cheap rather than dear, considering what they offer, and before second breakfast they went down to the management in order that hans castorp might acquit himself of his debt

hans castorp regarded him earnestly as they drove
consul hermann hagenstrbm supports his considerable weight on the balustrade, breathes heavily into his red beard, and talks with senator dr cremer, the chief of police, whose brown beard, mixed with grey, frames a smiling face expressive of a sort of gentle slyness
the lawyer apparently no longer practised his profes- sion, he only read the newspaper, read it indeed all the time; on hot days he permitted himself to do it sitting in his room in his drawers, with the door open
they sent for sister leandra, and she came
one was, indeed, compelled to recognize in the hierarchy a force making for freedom: had it not set limits to the boundless pretensions of monarchy?
often enough, from his youth onwards, he had sternly brought his feelings into line
but then when he had shaken hands all round he came back and said good- bye again, quite simply, so that one was able to respond
the truth was, peeperkorn said, and lifted his head from the pillow, elevated the arabesques on his brow, and gave point to his remarks by the little circle and the upright finger-tips—the truth was, in the world of matter, that all substances were the vehicle of both life and death, all of them were medicinal and all poisonous, in fact therapeutics and toxicology were one and the same, man could be cured by poison, and substances known to be the bearer of life could kill at a thrust, in a single second of time
very good indeed, said the doctor
he would have been sought in vain within her walls
more than that, the estates had paid for themselves over and over, with the entrance fees drawn from the romantic curiosity of two helnispheres
even hans castorp laughed; but this, however humiliating it was to his better feelings, was nothing compared to the tales that circulated about a certain lawyer from jüterbog, einhuf by name; a man perhaps forty years old, with a pointed beard and very hairy hands, who had taken the swede’s place at herr settembrini’s table
the sound, that is, had thus been thrown up to the rather low ceiling of the hall, and it had seemed as though the notes, unlike any familiar to man, and in any case unlike any known church music, floated down thence and hovered angeli- cally above the heads of the assemblage
tony laid the wreath on the tablet, where her father's name stood on the stone in fresh gold letters: then, despite the snow, she knelt down by the grave to pray
this simply was not the fact; but she saw it, and it made her happy

for business reasons - this and that
he had heard his name often enough from frau antonie, and he threw a quick glance at his sister as he greeted herr permaneder in his most fascinating manner
i forgot to mention that there was in the schweigestill court- yard, adrian's later home, and certainly not surprisingly, a stable- girl, with bosoms that shook as she ran and bare feet caked ,vith dung; she looked as much like i-ianne of buchel as one stable-girl does look like another, and in the reproduction was named walt- purgis
but here now was naphta on the side of the soul and disease, wherein alone true nobility and humanity resided, while settembrini flung himself into advocacy of nature and her noble sanity, regardless of his inconsistency on the score of emancipation from her
but hans castorp answered: let be
you must forgive me, then, and not think too hardly of me
he had been attacked by a stomach ailment, not yielding to any dietary measures, beginning 'with violent headache, lasting several days and recurring in a few more; with hours, yes, whole days of retching from an empty stonach, sheer misery, undigni- fied, niggling, humiliating, ending in utter exhaustion and per- sistent sensitivity to light after the attack had {>assed
how can the herr consul say that after his speech in the assembly--?

he went in, whereupon the bell above the door began to give tongue, like a little watch-dog
albeit inasmuch as the glass is set and the sand has begun to run; for this reason, my good man, i would fain come to an understanding with you

he recalled the contemptuous gesture of the humanist when he spoke of the parthians and scythians in whose company he was forced to take the rest-cure
george looked more like his father too, while adrian physi- cally resembled the mother - though again there is a discrepancy, for it was adrian, not george, who inherited the tendency to mi- graine
but these experts are in the aforementioned box
two human beings, buried alive, their lungs full of pit gas, would here together—or, more horrible still, one after the other—succumb to the pangs of hunger, and thereafter the process of putrefaction would do its unspeakable work, until two skeletons remained, each totally indifferent and insensible to the other’s presence or absence

the youth of the place had got hold of the treatise before those of riper years; studying it in part in groups, after supper, in their various rooms

he was not more polite to one than to the other
he had not had the heart to leave her in the lurch at this hour; and he now walked to the middle of thii room to meet their d guests, while tony remained on the sofa
people were beginning to find him a little ludicrous; but perhaps their laugh would have turned to pity if they had even dimly suspected how much he was on his guard against their laughter!
listen to me, shouted the consul, stretching out both hands in front of him and shaking them in excitement

armgard von schilling talked about the cows at home
he took out his notebook and turned over the leaves in silence; but as the order in the classroom left much to be desired, he lifted his head, stretched out his arm over the desk, and waved his flabby white fist a few times power-lessly in the air

herr settembrini has omitted to add, broke in naphta, that the rousseauian idyll is a sophisticated transmogrification of the church’s doctrine of man’s original free and sinless state, his primal nearness and filial relation to god; to which state he must finally return

you would gain an extraor- dinary unity and congruity, a sort of astronomical regularity and legality would be obtained thereby
he tried to catch his cousin’s eye, and saw that joachim’s sunburnt face had gone all spotted, as a tanned complexion will when the blood leaves it with suddenness; his mouth too was pitifully drawn, and wore an expression that sent an indefinable chill of fear over hans castorp and made him hasten to change the subject

the taste displayed by the hofrat in his choice of a model was too like hans castorp’s own for him to put great faith in the disinterested character of the affair, and the thought of the hofrat’s purple cheeks and bloodshot, goggling eyes only strengthened his scepticism
they hid be-hind uncle justus, and got him to send his wife ta her sister-in-law, the wife of ovcrdieck the lumber dealer
he had been in the employ of a fire-insurance company, and made constant extended journeys from st petersburg up and down the whole of russia, visiting insured factory buildings and spying out those which were financially suspect; for it was a fact supported by statistics that the larger percentage of fires occurred in just those factories where business was not going too well

dr krokowski would enter by the open balcony door at a quarter to four or earlier, greet the patient with manly readiness, put the usual professional questions, with perhaps a little personal touch as well, a jest or two—and if all this had a slight aura of the questionable about it, yet one can get used even to the questionable, provided it keeps within bounds

he had very good looks and had kept his swiss manner of speech, pleasant to the ear, deliberate, formal, inter- spersed with survivals of old-gerlan expressions oddly solemn to hear

it appeared that there had been wild and arbitrary exhibitions of power, like those in fräulein kleefeld’s room: knockings on walls and table, the turning off of the lamp, and these as well as further manifestations were being systematically produced and investigated, with every possible safeguarding of their genuineness, after comrade krokowski had practised the approved technique and put little elly into her hypnotic sleep
the senator himself, one thursday afternoon when the weinschenks were not present, had called it that, and frau permaneder quite relished the joke

but instead of going to the good russian table, the unmannerly female glided noiselessly to hans castorp’s side and without a word reached him her hand—not the back, but the palm—to kiss

prince esterhazy was an especial friend of this master art, but in the mass in c which beethoven wrote for him, the composer, after unsuccessful attempts, had not arrived at a fugue; even socially considered, that was a discourtesy, but artis- tically it had been an unpardonable lack, and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives altogether lacked any fugue form, al- though it would have been most proper there

you are in absolute danger of your life, he had bellowed at her, just like that, without making any bones of it
she would not have married him if she had not felt sure of his essential agreement with her in these matters
he was much more sprightly than he used to be; there was a certain lack of re- straint in his roving eye, and he would ask ever so many times about gerda buddenbrook's fiddle without getting any reply

yes, such consolatory promises must have been vouchsafed our young man before he returned to number thirty-four; for he had had no word with frau chauchat on the day following, had not seen her indeed, save twice at some distance: once when the glass door slammed, and she had slipped for the last time to her place at table, clad in her blue cloth skirt and white sweater

the son of the house of schweigestill, gereon, the same who had introduced the new danure-spreader, a young farmer rather disobliging and curt but obviously knowing his business, awaited the guest at the little station, on the box of a trap with a high frame and stiff springs
all the guests declared they could not bear to look any more at the snow, they were sick of it; they had had their fill in the summer-time, and now these masses and heaps and slopes and cushions of snow, day in and day out, were more than they could stand, their spirits sank under the weight of it
they talked about it in glowing terms on the bourse for a whole week
a carpet almost covering the floor, only too necessary in tinter, soon hid the worn boards; and to the corner bench, the only seat in the room besides the savonarola chair in front of the work-table, there was added after a few days without any fastidi- ous regard for style, which was not in adrian's line, a very deep reading- and easy-chair covered with grey velvet, from bern- heimer's in \unich, a commendable piece, which together with its separate stool, a tabouret with a cushion, deserved the name of chaise-longue; it took the place of a divan, and did its owner al- most two decades of service
the second week was passing; soon two-thirds of his holiday would be gone; the third week would no sooner begin than it would be time to think of packing

a little girl spoke a piece, a common soldier was with difficulty prevented from reading to the end a manuscript that began dear citizens and citizenesses!

for theirs was a work of supererogation (ex supererogatione) in that they not only combated the rebellion of the flesh (rebellio carnis), which after all was incumbent upon any average healthy human reason to do, but were hostile to even an inclination toward the things of the sense, toward love of self and love of worldly things, even where these had not been directly forbidden

frau stöhr, fräulein engelhart, hermine kleefeld and her friend the tapir-faced girl, herr albin, the young man with the finger-nail, and perhaps others among the guests—would stand together and watch him, with the corners of their mouths drawn down, fairly chortling, whilst he, poor wight, his face aglow with the heat that from the first had never left him, with the glittering eye the gentleman rider’s cough had kindled, would gaze, forlornly and frantically smiling, in one certain direction
what will you have to do now?
what a charming sight altogether, this host of shawms in their highly developed stage of technical perfection, challenging the passion of the virtuoso in all of their forms: as bucolic oboe, as cor anglais well versed in tragic ways; the many-keyed clarinet, which can sound so ghostly in the deep chalumeau register but higher up can glean in silvery blossoming harmony, as basset horn and bass clarinet
had he not once, who always sat so erect at table, loathed and despised the banging of doors, and never, never was tempted to gnaw his fingers, because to that end maria had been given him instead, had he not once taken deep offence at the unmannerly behaviour of frau chauchat, and felt an unconquerable sense of superiority when he heard the narrow-eyed one essay to speak his mother-tongue?

he went so far as to ask him to orchestrate the piano reductions of single acts from operas unknown to adrian, and the conparison of that ,vhich the pupil tried, who had heard and read berlioz, debussy, and the german and austriall late ro- mantics, with that which grctry or cherubini had actually done made llaster and pupil laugh
what were they so jolly about?

sitting very erect, he would turn the whole upper part of his body to speak to his neighbour (with selfpossession, of course, and a little platt) and he kept his elbows well in as he dismembered his piece of fowl, or deftly, with the appointed tool, drew the rosy flesh from a lobster’s shell

something amazing, something dreadful, something at which the very actors in the scene themselves stood aghast and incredulous
then there was a woman named mathilde spiegel, dressed in the fashion of a bygone time: she wore a train trimmed with ruffles, and a fladus - a ridiculous corruption of the french flute douce, originally meaning flattery, but here used for a curious coiffure with curls and ornaments

this industrious, solid citizen with the rough exterior and no social graces, who devoted himself with an obstinate sense of duty to his work alone--this man was supposed to have been guilty, not once but repeatedly, of a serious fault: he was accused of, he had been indicted for, performing a business manoeuvre which was not only questionable, but directly dishonest and criminal

that we shall soon--we can soon see--!
he would be so good, he was told, to have patience for a few days; the hofrat was busy, there were operations and general examinations, suffering humanity must take precedence, that was a sound christian principle; and as he was ostensibly in good health, he must get used to the idea that he was not number one up here, that he must stand back and await his turn
then, with a series of starts, she came to herself, blinked in her turn at the light with sleep-stiffened eyes and smiled

naphta sharply forbade settembrini to call himself an individualist, for so long as he denied the antithesis between god and nature, saw in the problem of man’s inward conflict no more than the struggle between individual and collective interest, and was vowed to a materialistic and bourgeois ethic, in which life became an end in itself, limited to utilitarian aims, and the moral law subserved the interest of the state

frau stöhr went about for days quite outraged on account of a loan of ten francs which she inadvisedly laid out for frau iltis at the meeting, and which the latter had forgotten to return

you looked at the thick ash-blonde hair, rolled at the sides, drawn back above the little ears, and fastened on the top of the head with a broad tortoise-shell comb; at the soft expression of her grey-blue eyes, her pretty upper lip, the fine oval and delicate colour of her face--and you thought of three-and-twenty, perhaps; never of thirty
he was vain, that is, not in a common ,yay, but in poetic reference to the endless potential of happiness in the world, far outbidding his own power of resolution, for which he wished to keep himself young and handsome; he was aggrieved at the tendency of his face to be prematurely wrinkled and weather-beaten

a closed carriage, its top glistening with wet, its wheels clogged with mud, was before the door

he had continued to live in the old consul’s roomy villa in harvestehuder way, though he had been a husband and father for some years, having taken a wife from his own social sphere, of his own highly civilized and elegant type, with the same soft, quick, pointedly polite manner of speech

thus we spent many a sun- day afternoon in the good time of year at the farm, where the town-dwellers gratefully partook of the good cheer of the coun- tryside with which frau leverktihn regaled them: the grainy dark bread with fresh butter, the golden honey in the comb, the

and she learned from his own lips that he had dade the journey thither on her account
to do this gives me the needed reassurance, still needed even as it was at the time when i was present with horror, amaze, consternation, and pride, at its birth - an experience that i suppose was due to my loving devotion to its author but ac- tually went beyond my mental capacities, so that i trembled and was carried away
he entered a yellow-brown house in mill street and went up to the first storey, where a brass plate on the door said, brecht, dentist
according to him, he had not closed an eye, his parched throat making him start up every five minutes from his pillow
we live up here, next door to the dying, close to misery and suffering; and not only we act as though we had nothing to do with it, but it is all carefully arranged in order to spare us and prevent our coming into contact with it, or seeing anything at all—they will take away the gentleman rider while we are at breakfast or tea—and that i find immoral
her father continued to probe her with his eyes
he had begun of late to grow a little stout, the single sign of age in his carefully preserved exterior, and his cheeks, behind the pointed protruding ends of his moustaches, looked rounder  than they used; but it was a pale and sallow roundness, with-out blood or life
he did not know the lady, he said; but he did not, in his turn, ask who she was, nor did edelmann give any explanation of his question, other than merely by saying: at all events, you have (or meister has) no warmer admirer than she

he could not say enough to display the genuine cult of the real and by no means abstractly universal, hence also not almighty and all-present god of the people as a magic technique, a manipulation of dynamic forces, physically not without its risks, in which mishaps might easily oc- cur, catastrophic short circuits due to lllistal{es and failures
eva is very sweet to me, and her husband, herr niederpaur, the brewery superintendent, is an agreeable man
ah, ida, i think so much about the past these days: about the time when criinlich first appeared, and the scenes he made me--scan-dalous, ida!--and then about travemiinde and the schwarz-kopfs-- she spoke slowly, and her eyes rested for a while dreamily on a darn in erica's stocking
hans castorp was right in referring to them, as he did, with bated breath
christmas, like other holidays in the course of the year, served them for a fulcrum, or a vaulting-pole, with which to leap over empty intervening spaces

no one dreamed he would continue; with embarrassed smiles they watched this futile activity, thinking every moment it would cease

and dr krokowski went on to speak of a mushroom, famous in classical antiquity and since, on account of its form and the powers ascribed to it—a fungus in whose latin name the epithet impudicus occurred; and which in its form was suggestive of love, in its odour of death
ida gave a joyous shriek and answered with some polish gibberish
then you must take hold and lift four times

pale, trembling, too ex-hausted to think about what had happened, he closed his eyes and sank back in lethargy

the pretexts she gave to little johann would have led him to believe that all his con- temporaries were either scrofulous of full of evil humours, and that he himself was a solitary exception; which did not tend to increase his already deficient confidence and ease of manner

so much for the present about the daughters, with whom adrian came into relations as housemates
the truth is: in a certain point, in puncto puncti as young people like to say, i formed in the company a somewhat comic excep- tion and fell so to speak out of the frame; namely, in my quality and way of life as a benedict, which paid tribute to what we half excusingly, half glorifyingly called nature

nobody's face was beaming with joy, there was no lively conversation
it was easy for him to understand and respect hans castorp’s reserve—the more in that he shared it, even feeling his own position to be more difficult than the other’s
it would not be the truth if i should say no

these were masculine evenings, with the beer-glass on the floor beside the chair, a cigar in the mouth, and frequent bursts of talk, strange, dry interruptions in the middle of the language of music; tapping of the bow and counting back of the bars when the players got out, which was almost always the fault of the singing- master

dr faustus  fatigue, the capacity for disgust - all that was perfectly calculated to make a profession of the talent bound up with it
it was a horrid sight
hans castorp found that charming—most edifying

he un-doubtedly had a few verses in his pocket for the present oc-casion
at least he clothed his discomfort in words which recognized the simplicity, good taste, and informality of our af- fair, the absence of customs and curtsyings as he put it
they shrugged their shoulders and gave it out as their view that it took two to play at such games, and that it was unlikely anything had happened against the will of either participant
the senator was dying
but what will you have?
the extended summer trip which had once been customary with the buddenbrooks had now been given up for some years
herr settembrini’s question, and its delivery, were prodigious
but the drops will be hanging on the trees outside--we can drink coffee in the verandah
do you know how you look?
this is it, this is it!
if you were ill the last time, you could have had help in that part; besides, if the first part dealt with the condition before the tribulation, and the second part with the tribulation itself, you could have told by counting on your fingers that the third part must deal with the con-dition after the tribulation!
how could she enter into joachim’s turbulent emotions, due in part to the sensation that he was come home, which for the moment outweighed all else, and in part to the stimulus of the incomparably light, empty, yet kindling air he was once breathing?
will you permit me—not a word
maybe yelling commands in the service set up a locus minoris resistentiæ there
a hint lay in his suggestion that they might telegraph and let the parents know
he must soon have seen that he did not fit in very well; but he concealed the fact under an increased assurance of manner, while the frau consul, uncle justus, and the senator--though hardly the broad street bud den-brooks--practised a tactful complaisance toward the socially awkward, hard-working official
in white flannel trousers and blue blazer, he would come back late from his treatment, neat and military; would enter the dining-room, make his little bow, courteous and composed, in excuse of his tardiness, and sit down to his meal, which was specially prepared, for he no longer ate the regular food, on account of the danger of choking; he received minces and broths
but she did not come: she was dead
i ca not be anything
on their heels came the parents of frau consul kr�, the lumber-dealer overdieck and his wife, a fond old pair who still addressed each other in public with nicknames from the days of their early love
the listeners almost died of laughter at his falsetto parlando, at the contrast between the deep voice and the tongue-splitting facility with which it rendered the words
space, like time, engenders forgetfulness; but it does so by setting us bodily free from our surroundings and giving us back our primitive, unattached state
his trousers, of beautiful and lasting english stuff, flapped about his crooked emaciated legs
in sucll talk, with which he teased and irritated me, there was much that was merely imitative
hans castorp would shift his hands to behind his head, and reply to all he was asked, smiling in his turn

i need do nothing more, i don’t count, i can laugh at the whole thing
hans castorp listened to herr settembrini out of a sense of duty and fairness, in the idea of hearing both sides; with the best of intentions he tested the latter’s views on the subject of the republic, reason and the bello stile
copernicus will go down before ptolemy
thus might he return
you are thinking of the earthquake of messina
but whc-n tony, as chance offered, tried to come bark to the subject, he wrapped himself in silence, the more forbidding because of his inward mortification over having given way--his inward bitterness at being, as he felt, feeble and inadequate to the situation in hand
classicism- yes, it is not sophisticated at all, but it is great
this was a stage higher than the mill
taking in this sense too, great as the whole piece itself, the fare- well of the sonata form

he gesticulated, he tore open his shirt to offer his yellow breast to the stroke of fate; and continued thus, until an attack of coughing, which forced a thread of red foam to his lips, quenched his harangue and gave the cousins an excuse to go out, on tiptoe
he repeated them, softly, trying to reproduce the guttural, rustically formal syllables of the mountain tongue, as he climbed another stretch higher, above the hut
even so, there came an evening when joachim might behold his cousin the centre of a group composed of hermine kleefeld, gänser, rasmussen, and the youth of the monocle and the finger-nail, making an impromptu speech on the subject of frau chauchat’s peculiar and exotic facial structure, and betraying himself by his unsteady voice and the excited glitter of his eyes, until his listeners exchanged glances, nudged each other, and tittered
she was small as a child, with a long, oldish face—a dwarf, he realized with a start
dr faustus  he gave this sense of the comic free rein, recal]ing droll types among pupils and teachers, or describing his last cultural expedi- tion and some small-town opera performance, whose improvisa- tions could not fail to be a source of mirth, though without det- riment to the seriousness of the work performed
the genius, in the course of the conversation we have repeated, and elsewhere, called hans castorp a joli bourgeois au petit endroit humide, which might in some sense be considered a translation of the settembrinian epithet life’s delicate child; and the question thus was, which constitutes of the mingled essence of his being would prove the stronger, the bourgeois or the other

a round table, its slender legs decorated with fine lines of gilding, stood, not in front of the sofa, but by the wall oppo-site the little harmonium, on which lay a flute-case; some stiff arm-chairs were ranged in a row round the walls; there was a sewing-table by the window, and a flimsy ornamental writing-desk laden with knick-knacks

he ascribed it to atavistic memory, a blood heritage, that he very often dreamed of riding; he was uncommonly convincing when he showed us how natural it ,vas for him to hold the reins in the left hand and pat the horse's neck with the right

nobody but jews have such puny figures
he played instrumental works by brahms and bruck- ner, schubert, robert schumann; then by the later and the latest, tchaikovsky, borodin, and rimsky-i(orsakov; by anton dvoralc, berlioz, cesar franck, and chabrier, constantly challenging his pupil's power of imagination with loud explanations, to give or- chestral body and soul to the insubstantial piano version: cello cantilena!

he was a soldier
she could ad-just herself with ease and cheerfulness to any situation
i do not mean getting drunk: i mean the feeling you have the next day--the after-effects
to make matters worse, it was a fish dish that had just been handed, and there was ground for fear that popoff, in his spasm, might choke on a bone
hans castorp was rather relieved than otherwise at this state of affairs; for the pledge he had drunk with clavdia chauchat’s protector made him difficulties, in general conversation, of the same kind he had to deal with in the case of frau chauchat herself, namely the avoidance of the formal mode of address—as though, as peeperkorn said, they had eaten a philippina together

the deepest silence reigned

and it is true that this part of our story might, like an earlier chapter, bear the caption a newcomer

are we forced to live within the smallest limits we can?
to explore and lay open all the windings of his emotions would keep us far too long; suffice it to say that his observation of the mannheimer gave our poor young friend enough to think on and to suffer
or was he of more than one mind whether he should await the autumn up here or resolve on unlawful departure?

and our discussion comes to an end at the right moment, for here we are, settembrini said, and pointed out to the cousins with his stick the cottage before whose gate they had paused
extraordinary—displays great— in revenge, they looked at each other, pantomimed despair, angled for hans castorp’s glance; but he refused to be drawn

she heard it, and retorted by calling him a turkey-cock and bidding him keep his filthy jokes to himself
we were speaking of tolerance; it is surely superfluous for me to emphasize that far from mere toleration, i feel for protestantism, as the historical opponent of the enslavement of knowledge, the most profound admiration
certain things are no longer possible
herr settembrini walked from the humanistic folding-desk in the little window, where he had been standing, up to the table, nearer his pupil, who was sitting on the cot against the wall, his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands
for herr settembrini belonged to the francophile party in his own country, which was not surprising when one recalled that his grandfather had compared the six days of the july revolution to the six days of the creation, and seen that they were as good
well, how is everything, my dear tony--all right?
schalleen, as hans castorp knew, had not only packed his presents, but bought them, after consultation with the uncles

but now, thanks to the development of hygiene and the increase in personal security, a natural death was the rule, a violent one the exception; modern man had come to think of repose, after exhaustion of his powers, as not at all dreadful, but normal and even desirable
on the bier, i say to you beforehand, you will always find it lying on its face, and though you turn it five times you will ever find it on its face
you have such a kind, sympathetic cousin over there, went on the hofrat, motioning with his head in joachim’s direction and balancing himself on his heels
she praised the idea unreservedly

a few days later she brought him, not information about the young russian, but a fresh and startling piece of news
crimson-faced, bare-headed, overcoatless, he stood at the edge of the platform as the train rolled in, beneath his relative’s carriage window, and told him to come on out, for he was here
the surf is seething; wave after wave, with high, hollow sound, rears up, rebounds, and runs with a silken rustle out over the flat strand: here one, there one, and more beyond, out on the bar

\y own weak- ness in this :field, which was only tolerably made good by joyful application in philology, made me realize that excellence in per- formance is naturally conditioned by sympathy with the subject and thus it was a real boon to me to see this condition - at least here - fulfilled by my friend too
the record had not run out before elly shuddered violently
his heart stood stock-still, it seemed not to beat
perhaps they took it as a whim, a rhetorical flourish; it went something like this: esteemed, in especial dear and beloved brethren and sisters
he lived now the life of a private gentleman; but, being rather ashamed of the fact, he always pretended to be overwhelmed with work

it was she 'who, while playing the part of exemplary housewife and mother, managed the affair, manipulated and concealed the daily artifices and the double life, which naturally gnav/ed at her nerves and terrified her by threatening the precarious loveliaess of her looks: for instance, it deepened the two furrows between her blond bro,vs until she looked almost maniacal

the craci{, and tien the little arms pressed closer to the sides, the grinding spasm, cruel to see but perhaps no longer felt, twisted the little limbs
hans castorp felt only contempt for the revolted lover and expressed it by a shoulder-shrug
that is your character
he spoke of the small vexations and rewards of the service, of the wonderfully satisfying comradeship, of the sheepish loyalty of his bursch, of funny occurrences on the parade-ground and in instruction; of inspection, of love-feasts
but one cannot say that adrian met the little boy half-way
what was all this?
think how he urged in the assembly the union of the hamburg diligences with the postal service; and how in  he forced the senate by continuous pressure to join the german-austrian postal union!
when you saw them together you felt that here was a rapidly aging man, already a little heavy, with his young wife at his side
but now i trembled at the thought that his chastity since then, since that embrace, since his passing contagion and the loss of his physicians, sprang no longer from the ethos of purity but from the pathos of impurity

the listeners heaved each a deep sigh—they had been holding their breaths during herr settembrini’s great replication
and the sympathicus caused his heart, hans castorp’s heart, to thump, in such a way that it was impossible to breathe except in gasps; and shivers ran over him, due to the functioning of the sebaceous glands, which, with the hair follicles, erected themselves
i can only repeat that you must do what ynu think best
perhaps it would be well to make cautious application of that wisdom to the present case
he realized that he was talking to himself, and not too sensibly—for which he took himself to task, and then continued on purpose, though his lips were so stiff he could not shape the labials, and so did without them, as he had on a certain other occasion that came to his mind
self-control and personal reserve are both lacking in the same way
so hans castorp took up again his strange position vis-à-vis to elly; the white light gave place to rosy twilight, the music began again, the pumping motions; this time it was hans castorp who announced trance
hans castorp asked with drawn brows
well, my dear reuter, he was saying as he entered, what do you say—shall we break the neck of another bottle?
and, moreover, i must admire the extent of your con-sideration
he paused by the table and turned toward his sister, drumming lightly on the surface with his bent forefinger as he said: i will tell you a little story, my dear tony, which will illustrate my attitude toward this affair
he folded his pince-nez and put it into his pocket, buttoned up his coat, and began to walk up and down the room with firm and rapid strides, which studiously betrayed no sign that he was giving the subject any further consideration
when did you come?
no, the same appetite was evinced by the silent, gloomy ones as well, those who in the pauses between courses leaned their heads on their hands and stared before them
i can add this quite calmly, since i share with no small part of our population, even those hardest hit and homeless, the feel- ing that we are only getting what we gave, and even if we must suffer more frightfully than we have sinned, we shall only hear in our ears that he who sows the ,vind must reap the whirlwind
that is what excites curiosity, and you have not, long as you have been squatting there, given space to the ques- tion in all your talk
the name does not come well to my ears, said the consul, quickly and harshly
it is not your way to linger with the finished work

then he fell again to musing, and the rapidity with which he drew the ends of his moustaches through his fingers was in remarkable contrast to the vacant fixity of his gaze

despite all he could say, the gloomy disaffection gained ground, threats of unlicensed departure were the order of the day, were even put into execution, without regard for the warning afforded by the melancholy return of frau salomon to the fold, now a life member, her tedious but not serious case having taken that turn by reason of her self-willed visit to her wet and windy amsterdam
it said: oh, mademoiselles!
in such a case, the consul argued, he must accommodate himself to the surrender of whatever sum was necessary

but after the meal they spoke of it, and joachim freed his mind on the subject of that damned female who had put the thing in his head with her silly question and somehow or other set a spell on him
quite a taking little dodge—but as a matter of fact, the epicanthus can be traced back to an atavistic vestige—it’s a developmental arrest
the great confusion played havoc, moreover, with emotional conceptions, or states of consciousness like still and again; and this was one of the very most gruesome, bewildering, uncanny features of the case

she tastes like papier mâché, i do assure you—precisely as when one has a spoilt digestion

at the same time there were now re- leased in her certain still keen desires of an unexhaustible and probably never satisfied love of life, in some humanly warmer sphere
and how many times had he answered it: in strong and purposeful hours with one answer, in weak and discouraged ones with another!
he held toward this chimerical goal, that often quite vanished in mist, and took an exhausting climb against the wind before it was reached; finally drew near it—to discover, with what staggering astonishment and horror may be imagined, that it was only the hay-hut with the weighted roof, to which, after all his striving, by all his devious paths, he had come back
joachim expressed disapproval of the expenditure
it is the half-articulate art, the dubious, the irresponsible, the insensible
i myself, speaking as one who early submitted his own head and heart to the phenomenon of adrian's cool and bafflingly self-contained ex- istence, have i the smallest right to mock at the fascination which his aloneness, the nonconformity of his life, exerted upon these women?

he was moved by his transports to a course that only the very violence of emotion could pursue
nothing was to be heard but a measured, peaceful sound which meant that the boy was raking the gravelled paths of the kurgarden below, and the buzzing of a fly that had got between the blind and the window and was storming the pane--you could see his shadow shooting about in long zigzag lines
yes, yes, said the senator, making a gesture of repulsion with his hand
to the astonishment of the staff, the senator now often left his work during office hours, to pace up and down in the garden with his hands behind his back, or to work about, raking the gravel paths, tying up the rose-bushes, or dredging mud out of the fountain
we even confess that it is without great concern we leave the question open
it was as if he were addressing his remarks to god or to his own soul

what a splendid morning!
in any case there had to be cuts
then there were storms so violent as to prevent one’s sitting on the balcony for the driven snow which blew in, in such quantity as to cover floor and chair with a thick mantle

i learned this fact in michael- mas °- at the beginning of the next year wendell accord- ingly left kaisersaschern to take over his new position, and from then on the correspondence went forward between halle and leipzig, to and fro: kretschmar's sheets covered on one side with large, scratching, spluttering letters; adrian's replies on rough

he, naphta, was well aware that man’s inner conflict based upon the antagonism between the sensible and the supra-sensible; it was he, not settembrini, who represented the true, the mystical individualism

still in the most fragile health, he worked ten hours a day and more, broken only by a short pause at midday and now and then a walk round the pond or up the hill, brief excursions more like flight than recreation

when the waves of tribulation went over him once more he would think of the sea and of the kurgarden, and of the sound made by the little waves, coming hither out of the mysterious slumbering distance

they heard something charming: a pure, bell-like sound, coming from the bottom of the room and flowing sweetly, sensuously, with indescribably tender effect, on the sudden silence
hans castorp, all flushed and depleted from taxing his brains in the cold, shaky as to his capacity for clear expression, hot and cold with his own audacity, heard himself babble that always since a child he had pictured death to himself as wearing a starched ruff, or at least a sort of half-uniform, with a stand-up collar, while life, on the other hand, wore an ordinary collar

those eyes, under their long-lashed lids, blend the light blue of the father's and the brown of the mother's iris into a pale, indefinite, 'changeful golden-brown; but bluish shadows lie in the deep corners on both sides of the nose, and these give the little face, which is hardly yet a face at all, an aged look not suited to its four weeks of existence

thus now hans castorp was privileged to behold the good joachim—but with the aid and under the auspices of physical science; and by his cousin’s express permission, so that it was quite legitimate and without gruesome significance

whereas we, on the contrary—
to alter these shocking conditions, to which habit and ignorance had rendered those who saw them callous - for instance the indescribable filth of the village street, the utter lack of sanitation in the dwelling-hovels - would have amounted to a revolutionary deed, to which no single individual, certainly not a woman, could bring herself
hans castorp ironically asked his cousin, on the third day

truly, in his own physical person he was contaminate; yet what mattered that, since his mind was untainted and sound—and quite competent to bring confusion to his priestly opponent in any discussion touching the body, or to laugh him to scorn over the soul?
oh, now i am so new up here, i am still rather bewildered—you can imagine
the road to travem�irst crosses the ferry and then goes straight ahead
frau stöhr, for all her stupidity and ill breeding, was unquestionably worse off than he—not to mention dr blumenkohl

while the rest drank their coifee he played the voilin, like a gipsy, passionately, with abandonment--and with what dexterity!
such an idea would never have entered tony's head of itself; but since he said it, she believed it, and her feeling for him had thereby grown warmer and ten-derer

she had slept very badly, and in the night she rang for ida jung-mann, who now slept in the back room of the entresol
he had a way of running one hand in between the buttons of his half-open undress coat and of sit-ting with his head supported on the back of his hand
what do you mean, tom?
there is not a glory of the flesh i would not offer her, castorp, if it were only a matter of the body, not of the countenance, if it were not her accursed soul that will have none of me, without which i should have no longing for her body—that is the devil’s treadmill in which i eternally go round and round
in one breath, or rather in one breathlessness, he wrote down the three pieces, anyone of which would have been enough to make menlrable the year of its production; actually he began with the draft of the trio on the very day on which he finished the lento of the quartet, which he composed last

\ y hand trembles as i vvrite; but in quiet, collected words i will say what i know, always consoled to a certain extent by the thought to which i gave utterance above, the idea of choice, the thought that something obtained here like a bond of love, which lent to the coming together of the precious youth and that un- happy creature a gleam of soul though of course this consola- tion is inseparable from the other thought, so much more dread- ful, that love and poison here once and for ever became a frightful unity of experience; the mythological unity embodied in the arrow it does look as though in the poor thing's mind something an- swered the feeling which the youth brought to her no doubt she remembered that fleeting visit her approach, that caressing of his cheek with her bare arm, might have been the humble and tender expression of her receptivity for all that distinguished him

and they knew in meng street, and at the club--yes, the whole town knew--who was responsible

then he lifted the glass once more, and spilled half its contents, draining the remainder furiously at a gulp
his face, with the black almond-shaped eyes, displayed a slight grimace as he did so, but whether this happened in the effort to see more clearly or for other causes, he did not permit it to appear

but with a sort of horror at himself he saw it coming, that if he made this discipline his own, bound himself over, identified himself with it, he would very soon be disillusioned, bored; get as sick and tired of it as though he had ladled it in with a cooking-spoon (this gro- tesque simile also i recall literally)
he felt no unpleasant sensation, the blood-letting had had a soothing effect, but he found himself in a state of extraordinarily reduced vitality, so that when he exhaled the air, he felt no need to draw it in again, and lay there moveless, for the space of several quiet heart-beats, before taking another slow and superficial breath
mexican, you know; doesn’t know a word of german and hardly any french, just a few scraps
his father so arranged it, and, though hanno was afraid, he made not a syllable of objection
settembrini says it is the law of love of one’s kind; that sounds like his ancestor, the carbonaro
then the bril clanged loudly, and the pupils began to stream through the entrances into the building
how often had the normal day of the berghof renewed itself, since the faroff time when hans castorp lay and grumbled within himself because dr krokowski described an arc about him and left him on one side!
they helped him lift his unwieldy body from table, gave him the support of their arms, and he walked with wide steps between them bedwards, his mighty head sunk on his lifted shoulder

they are a body of troops calculated as sufficient, even after great losses, to attack and carry a position and greet their triumph with a thousand-voiced huzza—not counting the stragglers that fall out by the way

he sat in his place, cold, remote, and lofty, and answered the information that the carriage would be around at once by saying scornfully, in a voice that trembled more with bitter-ness than age: then the mob permits me to go home?
as his master did not move or turn round or make any sign, the hump-backed apprentice shifted from one foot to the other, then made his outlandish scrape again and went down the back stairs
he would laugh at people who are much greater and better, and—more hu—man than himself and his—his ami bavard de la méditerranée, son maître et grand parleur— put together
i never have felt myself as firm as a rock, and my parents, both of them, dying so young—for i have been doubly orphaned from youth up, you know— herr settembrini described a single gesture, with head, hand, and shoulders

clarissa hoped to succeed
but his body would have it otherwise
he felt a relief, which however bore within it the seeds of fresh disquiet, when he saw that hans castorp paid no heed, though he must have noticed the incident, but passed it over with an unconcern which was not so much tact, consideration, or courtesy, as it was the purest indifference, an uncanny invulnerability or complaisance, as though he had long ceased to notice or to feel surprise at such occurrences

then, with a voice that sounded as though he had just burnt his throat with hot grog, i am a simple sort of a man, and do not know much about landlubber's tricks and skin games; but if you mean, maybe, that--well, sir, you can just set it down right away that you have got on the wrong tack, and are making a pretty bad miscalculation about my fatherly hopes

i flatter myself that in my dealings with these gentry i have not usually made the impression of a morally in-ferior exploiter; to tell the truth, the boot has sometimes been on the other foot--i have run across men who were far less scrupulous than i am!
he talks so, somehow

the frau consul smiled forbearingly
her peevish face looked scarlet above her neck-ruche, and tiny purple veins showed in the cheeks
how well you do that!
she thus celebrates, he said, her cosmic aptitude for allegory; for those elements were, as it were, the first and simplest materials of the world, a parallelism of which a phi- losophizing artist of a day not long gone by - it was wagner again of whom he spoke - had shrewdly, perhaps with somewhat too mechanical, too ingenious cleverness, made use, in that in his cosmogonic myth of the ring he made the basic elements of music one with those of the world

and that other, perhaps more intense, but strangely inarticulate language, that of tones - if one nay so designate music - does not seem to me to be included in the pedagogic- humanistic sphere, although i well know that in greel{ education and altogether in the public life of the polis it played an ancillary role
he walked on his left side expressly; and when there came a little rise to surmount, would help his cousin, who had grown by now unsteady on his feet; would put his arm across his shoulder; overcoming his shyness, would even leave it there a while, until joachim shook it off pettishly and said: don’t, it looks silly—as if we were drunk, coming along like that
speaking generally, it was altogether possible that her relations with the russian visitor had a disinterested and harmless character
hence the phrase perinde ac si cadaver, scoffed settembrini
i go into it in these pages because what happened did to some extent touch the life and destiny of my hero, adrian lever- klihn; yes, in one of them, to my actual knowledge, he was in- volved and active in an obscure and fatal 'way

his dis- like of his own very germanness (it was that, indeed, which drew him to the anglicist and anglolnaniac schildknapp) took the two disparate forms of a cocoonlike withdrawal from the world and an inward need of world-wideness
she turned to hans castorp
the music--it was beginning again; an idiotic racket, meant to be a galop, with the drum and cymbals marking a rhythm in which the other instruments all joined either ahead yf or behind time; a naive, insistent, intolerable hullabaloo of snarling, crashing, and feebly piping noises, punctuated by the silly tootling of the piccolo
but between whiles he was silent; we shall not say self-absorbed, for his attention was presumably directed outwards, though upon a single point
he responded little else than certainly, of course to the doctor’s blithe and hearty greeting, and was relieved when his nephew left him, passing by the balcony from joachim’s room to his own, after bidding him good-night and saying he would fetch him for eight o’clock breakfast
she stood there, in her paper cap, and looked him up and down, with a smile that betrayed no trace of pity, nor any concern for the ravages written on his brow
and the consul did feel the cold, felt it persistently, though his head was hot
then the spasm would relax in a merry, apologetic smile and things would run on again in almost uncanny fluency, for a while
one simply must draw the line somewhere!
up on the schatzalp there is a man, a greek peasant, an agent had him sent here from arcadia, he has galloping consumption, there isn’t the dimmest hope for him
after which tony's husband, like most of the friends whom he met around the table in the hofbrau house, to play cards and drink his regular three litres of beer, limited his activities to the raising of rents in his capacity of landlord, and to an un-disturbed cutting of coupons

not that i wasn’t in a funk as well, because i was—i was just one large blue funk all over
this was now in its sixth year, and gradually coming to be no longer so much a cure as a fixed condition of existence, a residence for life in rarefied atmosphere, coloured by some activity as latin master in the davos gymnasium for slightly tubercular boys

i am sick of it, that's all
she was leaning back in her chair, with drooping wrists and finger-tips poised on the table-edge, her head bent on one shoulder, her eyebrows raised, her little mouth drawn down so that it looked even smaller, with a tiny smile that had something both silly and sly about it, and gazing into space with vacant, childlike blue eyes
loudly, behind his brother's back he censured this pro- vocative licence and would not be talked round by his sister's soothing words, to the effect that the advocate was a full-blooded man, in danger of a heat stroke, which made light clothing a necessity to him
but for the sake of her bourgeois security she took part in the festivities of a community which was just one great art- society, and this it was emperilled the security she sought
when he told his partner of the poppt-nrade matter, herr marcus had for the first time in his life been angry with him, and had washed his hands of the whole affair

phidias, or that other chap with the mosaic ending to his name, would have stuck up their noses at her style of physiognomy—hullo, where are you going with the ham?

chest trouble is the last thing one would accuse her of
in short, the woman had become deeply offensive to me after i knew and saw what she let herself in for
she leaned back, crossed one leg lightly over the other, and stared into space
mankind will soon perceive that it is not the task of true science to run after godless understanding; but to reject utterly all that is harmful, yes, even all that ideally speaking is without significance, in favour of instinct, measure, choice

but here it became clear that his own powers would never take him over the stretch between him and the berghof; and accordingly, as there was no tram and he saw no carriages for hire, he hailed a driver going toward the dorf with a load of empty boxes and asked permission to climb into his wagon
but after pronouncing this aesthetic judgment he lay silent in his deck-chair, not thinking of anything more suitable to sing in its place

as for me, i felt sure that the peculiar tension between i{retsch- mar and adrian's mother had reference to adrian; i divined this because in the silent struggle that went on i stood in my own feeling between the two parties, inclining now to the one and now to the other
what had she meant by her look?

i did so with pedagogic restraint, with a view to reducing the situation to the everyday, and determined not to be sentimental
the surface of the lying snow began to thaw, grew soft and porous

the tracl{ round the sphere, of which there had been talk in those tor- turingly clever conversations at kridwiss's, this track, on which regress and progress, the old and the new, past and future, be- came one - i saw it all realized here, in a regression full of mod- ern novelty, going back beyond bach's and handel's harmonic art to the remoter past of true polyphony
and if i don’t arrive, it will be some time before they notice it, you may be sure of that
it made a great impression on me, to see him fresh from such exacting and splendid work, in which he is so much the master

dr krokowski greeted the new inmate with a jovial and robust heartiness, as who should say that with him all formality was superfluous, and only jocund mutual confidence in place

her second dowry, the eighteen thousand thaler so magnanimously returned by herr permaneder, lay waiting for erica; and directly frau antonie's practiced glanre marked the budding tenderness between her daughter and the director, she began to trouble heaven with a prayer that herr weinschenk might be led to visit them

how did we come to speak of her?—yes, herr hofrat, i remember as thought it was yesterday, how we met you in the garden, or, rather, you met us, for we were sitting on a bench—i could show you the very bench, to-day, that we were sitting on—we were sitting and smoking
hans castorp grieved for his cousin, reading in his eyes his pain at the approaching parting
in his two-fold guise
the senator stopped mechanically in his walk, asked mechanically about the concert and the spanish virtuoso, and said he was ready to go to bed
before the tribunal of reason, conscience, and common sense it could make no claims to be heard; principally, of course, because when all was said and done, frau chauchat was an ailing woman, feeble, fevered, and tainted within; her physical condition had much to do with the questionable life she led, as also with hans castorp’s instinctive reservations
for a chord combination that kretschmar rejected at first sight as being doubt- ful and awkward finally seemed to him more characteristic than what he himself had in mind, and at the next meeting he declared that he would like to take over adrian's idea

and now he strongly reminded me of the elder leverktihn's musing mania for speculating the elements
how often in my strained observation of adrian's ac- tivity i was forced to remember the early impressions we boys had got from that voluble stutterer, his teacher, with his antithe- sis of harmonic subjectivity and polyphonic objectivity!

yes, he knew it was largely the promptings of conscience to which he hearkened; to be precise, the promptings of a conscience not altogether easy—as he sat listening to the italian, one leg crossed over the other, drawing at his maria mancini; or when the three of them climbed the hill from the english quarter
hans castorp was ready, now as ever, of his own free will to lend an ear to settembrini’s teachings, and by way of experiment to be influenced by them
he had carefully avoided unfavourable conditions of atmospheric pressure, and left it to uncle james to stultify himself; yet an apoplexy carried him off after all; and a telegram, couched in brief but feeling terms—feeling more for the departed than for the recipient of the wire—was one day brought to hans castorp where he lay in his excellent chair
her large mouth drooped tragically at one corner

thus he had grown used to his silent and remote relation to pribislav hippe, and considered it a regular feature of his life; loved the emotions it brought in its train, the suspense as to whether he was likely to meet him that day, whether pribislav would pass close by him, even look at him; loved the subtle and wordless satisfaction imparted by his secret, loved even the disappointments inseparable from it—the greatest of which was pribislav’s absence from school
this was on account of the mi- graine, which from then on hindered him in the little preparation he had to do

but if he shudders when he hears life's voice, if the memory of that vanished scene and the sound of that lusty summons make him shake his head, make him put out his hand to ward it off as he flies forward in the way of escape that has opened to him--then it is clear that the patient will die
hans castorp, like so many others, experienced it—always with drawn and frowning brows, for this particular form of debauch is never a merry one
joachim knew it already: it had been in full blast when he arrived the year before—but hans castorp rather dreaded it, however well he felt himself equipped
would you, as my friend, want me to spend the rest of my life in this cloister?
but if, he sang, god should call him to himself, then would he look down protectingly on thee—meaning the singer’s sister, as hans castorp was perfectly aware, yet the word thrilled him to the depths, and his emotion prolonged itself as the hero sang, to a mighty choral accompaniment:

he explained certain de-tails of the procedure--the examination of witnesses had now been interrupted by the christmas recess--condemned the very obvious bias of the president, dr philander, and poured scorn on the attitude which the public prosecutor, dr hagenstriim, thought it proper to assume toward himself and the witnesses for the defence

if they understood him aright, he considered the use of tobacco one of those over-refined enjoyments the cultivation of which robbed of their majesty the simpler pleasures of life—those gifts and claims to which our power of feeling was even at best scarcely equal

not only that he repeatedly went too far in his frankness about his relations with inez - but also he went too far in another direction, culpably and impishly too far, betrayed by the darkness, i might say, if the notion of any betrayal is in place and one ought not to speak instead of an impudent intru- sion of familiarity upon solitude
how is it possible?
you have spoken to your pupils here of the bloody deeds of the church, her chastisements and her intolerance; very foolishly so, for it stands to reason that the zeal of the godly cannot be pacifistic in character—gregory himself said: cursed be the man who holds back his sword from the shedding of blood
he might have taken the large bronze plaque that stood on the etagere, but he seized instead a thin painted vase with flowers that stood next it, and threw it on the ground so that it smashed into a thousand bits
it went against his grain to eat butter served in the piece instead of in little fluted balls
the usual group of spectators stood about: frau iltis with her steriletto, the ivory levi, the inordinate popoff and his wife
and this is our son, he said
she said it to institoris, too, the suitor, when he behaved with something less than alacrity in his gallantries, or was slo,v in the uptake
what now happens to this mild utterance, rhythmically, harmonically, contrapuntally, to this pen- sive, subdued formulation, with what its master blesses and to what condemns it, into what black nights and dazzling flashes, crystal spheres wherein coldness and heat, repose and ecstasy are one and the same, he flings it down and lifts it up, all that one may well call vast, strange, extravagantly magnificent, without thereby giving it a name, because it is quite truly nameless; and with la- bouring hands l{retschmar played us all those enormous transfor- mations, singing at the same time with the greatest violence: dim-dada!
and the frau consul could not resist stretching out her hand to their guest with her sweeping gesture, palm upward, while the bracelets gave a little jingle

of these earlier owners, who died at about this time, i have little memory
he hissed when he talked, but his manners were cold and businesslike, and nothing betrayed the emotions of his soul
i have the honour, ma dame
the uncanny air of futility, or even a sort of sinister crackbrainedness, which hung about it was due to the addled fanaticism with which the former artist pursued and supported an economic idea, about which he was obviously so little serious that he made not the smallest effort to put it into execution
despite my dissimilar feelings i could but grant her a cultural sympathy
in the place where the four voices of the altar order the letting loose of the four avenging angels, who mow down rider and steed, emperor and pope, and a third of mankind, how terrifying is the effect of the trombone glissandos which here represent the theme!
her husband the brewer purported to have profited personally by a perusal, but regretted that his wife should have taken up that sort of thing, because such reading spoiled the women and gave them immodest ideas

in reality it had no end, it went on deep into the night, on and on, with bipolar position and historically conscious analysis, with extra-temporal qualities, ontological natural- ism, logical dialectic, and practical dialectic: painstaking, shoreless, learned, tailing off into nothing - that is, into slumber, to which our leader baworinski recommended us, for in the morning - as it already almost was - we should be due for an early start
we must repeat that, as for us, we have been speaking only of the lawful licence of a holiday, of fantasies born of leisure, of which the wellconducted mind wearies as quickly as a vigorous man does of lying in the warm sand

the pity the well person felt for the sick—a pity that almost amounted to awe, because the well person could not imagine how he himself could possibly bear such suffering—was very greatly exaggerated
yes, they had all had to come: mbllendorpfs, kistcnmakcrs, langhals, dverdiecks--before tony buddenbrook left her parental roof for ever, they had all gathered here, to offer her, despite driinlich, despite per-maneder, despite hugo weinschenk, their sympathy and condolences

after everybody laughed, as if they agreed with me, there sat this hagenstrom and brought out with ridiculous solemnity, tor my part--' stu-pid fool!
the discovery had been made through the jealousy of another young girl, a friend of emmy, who had found her way to emmy’s room by the same route the greek had taken—namely, across the balconies; and, distracted by her jealous rage, had made great outcry, so that everybody came running, and the scandal became known to the sparrows on the house-tops

yes, father leverkiihn was a dreamer and speculator, and i have already said that his taste for research - if one can speak of research instead of mere dreamy contemplation - always leaned in a certain direction - namely, the mystical or an intuitive half- mystical, into which, as it seems to me, human thinking in pur- suit of nature is almost of necessity led

dr anton cieszynski and stefan von rosinski, in connexion with the occurrences of the th of march, —, had after mature consideration come to the conclusion that the taking of the judicial steps which they recommended against m kasimir japoll for the calumny and detraction uttered against his wife jadwiga would afford him no satisfaction whatever, since

he watched his mother and herr pfu'hl with large quiet eyes; and thus, so early, he became aware of music as an extraordinarily serious, important, and profound thing in life

gercla buddenbrook, frau permaneder, [christian, and little johann sat under the big gas-lamp around the centre-table in the living-room, and worked industriously until far on into the evening
he played characteristic passages and a few complete scene se- quences: the first act, including the scene outside armado's house, and several later numbers which he had partly anticipated: in particular biron's monologues, which he had had especially in mind from the first, the one in verse at the end of the third act, as well as the prose one in the fourth: they have pitched a toil, i am toiling in a pitch - pitch that defiles; which, while always preserving the atmosphere of the comic and grotesque, expresses musically still better than the first the deep and genuine despair of the young man over his surrender to the suspect black beauty, his raging abandonment of self-mockery: by the lord, this love is as mad as ajax; it kills sheep; it kills me, i a sheep: this partly because the swift-moving, unjointed, ejaculatory prose, with its many plays on words, inspired the composer to invent musical accents of quite peculiar fantasticality; partly, also, because in music the repetition of the significant and already familiar, the suggestive or subtle invention, always makes the strongest and most speaking impression
you were making music
i don’t recall having tasted—oh, yes, once in my life i had pomegranate juice and soda; it was too sweet
and more than that, it is profoundly contradictory that a man should have, as leverklihn did, some feeling for the human eye, which after all speaks only to the eye, and yet refuse to perceive the outer world through that organ

for there is no doubt that their triumph and the his- torical sanction to regulate this world according to their beastly will would have destroyed his life-work and his immortality

if the position had really been what he said, if it were true that the horrible thing was actually an invention of the human reason, that only showed how grievously she always needed sustaining and enlightening, and how little ground the instinct-worshippers had for their fear that things could ever be too much directed by reason on this earth!

tony wept afresh; and covering her eyes with both hands, in which she held the batiste handkerchief, she sobbed out: oh, what are you asking me, papa?
and yet there is something else - some of us fear it at moments which seem to us criminal, but others quite frankly and steadily - something we fear more than german defeat, and that is german victory
here, i will give you a simple antiseptic—it may do you good, and she took a small packet out of the leather bag that hung from her girdle
he had a view of the square, the medixval city hall, the gothic marienkirche, whose domed towers were connected by a sort of bridge of sighs; the separate red tower, a very re- markable structure, also in gothic style; the statue of roland and the bronze statue of handel
horrible, he said suddenly, and a visible shudder ran over him as he got up
there is so much building, and the suburbs are spreading out, and we are able to have good streets and restore the old monuments out of our great period
he talks of youth con- descendingly too, as though he were not young himself; as though he were incapable of including himself and fitting in; as far as humility goes he knows very little about it
i hope you will enjoy it, he would finish in a dying voice, and quit the table, well knowing that joy would certainly not be their portion either
one day, after confirmation-class, i heard pastor prinpshpim tell somebody that one must just give me up, be-cause i romp of a derayed family
what i do is to prepare these pages for a time when the conditions for public interest vill be quite different, and certainly much more favour- able; when curiosity about the details of so thrilling an existence, however well or ill presented, ,viii be more eager and less fas- tidious
a tiny hole must be cut in it at once--there was a  peep-hole in the curtain at the theatre
in these forms, said the speaker, the subjective and the coventional assumed a new rela- tionship, conditioned by death
with his eyes red, his moustaches ruffled, his handkerchief in his hand, his coat wide open, hot and beside himself, he went out of the door and slammed it behind him
hans castorp hastened to do so, without looking round
lina, the maid-servant, came running through the hall and burst so suddenly into the room that ida jungmann called out sharply: i say, what do you mean--?
he has to content hirdself with deutsch-and that is a jewish nane, oh la, la
it was in high sum-
then thank ye kindly, and god be with ye, he said—the tears came to his eyes as he smiled and with that he would have been off, but instead sat suddenly down again with his hat and stick in his hand, being forced to the realization that his knees would not support him
do you still remember?
our best respects to you, buddenbrook--i repeat, our best respects!
there is no contradiction
but precisely about human- ity did schleppfuss speak, just that - of course in the sense of the classic centuries of belief on whose spiritual constitution he based his psychological discussion
all these raga-muffinly tricks tony buddenbrook was guilty of--indeed, she seemed to perform them with the best conscience in the world
where are the young folk off to?
even clara burst out laughing
i never can understand how anybody can not smoke—it deprives a man of the best part of life, so to speak—or at least of a first-class pleasure
the italian went on, without pausing for breath
the longest period of separation followed thereupon: the years when after a short stay in munich he was in italy with his friend the silesian schildknapp
hans castorp, laying aside traditional reserve, lightly touched with his lips the icy forehead of that which once was joachim; and though conscious still of mistrustful sentiments toward the man behind the scenes, yet submissively followed louisa ziemssen from the room
the consul listened as long as he could
you under-stand--the thing is this: in short, they have reached a point where hagenstrom demands immediate arrest or else a bond of twenty-five thousand marks
i must tell you of them when i see you; otherwise i should kill myself writing
this it was which lent freemasonry a new brilliance and charm, and explains the great number of recruits to it at that period of its history
probably he would have loved her much more passionately with the fish-tail she was born with than with those extremely painful legs
his voice, when he greeted gerda buddenbrook, was low and hollow, as though a bite were stuck in his throat: good morning, honoured lady!
there were those who wanted to make him healthy, to make him go back to nature, when, the truth was, he never had been natural
settembrini doesn’t care for her, and certainly she has her unpleasant side
the concerts will suffer a decided loss of personal appeal
he was much drawn to his uncle, even in the first two weeks; b)t the rime i got there it was plain that he clung espe- cially to adrian and wanted to be with him
the room lay in yellow daylight that came in thrnugii the striped blind
hans castorp had the more ground for horror, in that he himself fell a temporary victim to the plague—was, indeed, one of the severest cases
some navvies', in the service of the consul, took off their caps
the content of his dream entirely changed, and he stood trying to shoulder settembrini away from the spot where they stood, the italian smiling in his subtle, mocking way, under the full, upward-curving moustaches—and it was precisely this smile which hans castorp found so injurious
you are fond of anecdote—i could serve your turn
but had he suspected in what direction leo naphta would have altered his intentions beforehand, or at the decisive moment, not even the prevailing temper, of which all this was the outcome, could have driven him to let the affair go on
he sat with his brother on the back seat of the high, ungainly old coach, one short leg crossed over the other--and, wonderful to relate, he was gentle and conciliatory
i write it down in a mood of self-defence; and another emotion seizes me: the memory of that pandemonium of laughter, of hell- ish merriment which, brief but horrible, forms the end of the first part of the apocalypse
he sat in the dining-hall with the seven tables when there came a great crashing of glass as the verandah door banged, and madame chauchat entered in a white sweater, one hand in her pocket, the other at the back of her head
the head was roguishly on a side, the still open lips wreathed in wickedly suggestive smiles, the sybaritic little dimple appeared in one cheek—he was again the dancing priest, and jerked his head as before, mockingly, in the direction of so much cerebration, as they heard him say: ah, yes, yes, absolutely!
wehsal all at once began to weep bitterly, from some unplumbed depth of wretchedness
so much of our hans’s table-mates
nothing can come of me, that is perfectly sure
twilight was falling as they came up to the ocean temple, for the autumn was far advanced
the rest is not my affair
they will precisely fit the fact if i say that your way of misleading unsettled youth, of dissipating and undermining his moral and intellectual powers, is infamous, and cannot receive a stronger chastisement than it merits
then quiet again--and suspense
frau permaneder stood there, very erect, her shoul-ders elevated, her black-bordered handkerchief between her folded hands; and her pride in the chief role which it fell to her lot to perform was so great as sometimes entirely to ob-scure her grief
that is what i would call 'strict composition
for the present, she repeated, running her tongue over her upper lip
i an looking, he wrote to me, i keep asking round about and hankering for news of a place bur- ied from and untroubled by the \\rorld, ,vhere i could hold speech alone, with my life, my destiny
whether there were people going driving (certain expeditions had in fact been undertaken, among others by the half-lung club, which had gone in a body to clavadel)
as for the plate, its far greater antiquity could be read on the inside: the date  was engraved there in ornamental figures, framed in curly engraved lines executed in the modern manner of the period, florid and capricious devices and arabesques that were something between star and flower
who, deuce take it, had all that time to waste?
i am damned, and there is no pity for me for that i destroy all and every beforehand by speculation
i doubt if it is a question of sheer chance
as i said, for days they might keep the child from him, be- cause he was busy, or perhaps a headache shut him away in si- lence and darkness
he received his piece of money with gratitude, none the less
the humanist was put out
one of them, rooted in the steep bank at the side of the torrent, thrust itself aslant into the picture, with bizarre effect
val quarters in the cathedral were a good half of the time taken up with talks on philosophy and poetry
scientific exactitude forbade them to think of any such arbitrary going in and out
it was a mystery how much good and nourishing food that poor clothilde could absorb daily without any result whatever!
it would not be hard to imagine the existence of creatures, perhaps upon smaller planets than ours, practising a miniature time-economy, in whose brief span the brisk tripping gait of our second-hand would possess the tenacious spatial economy of our hand that marks the hours
from early on we had an eye on you, on your quick, arrogant head, your mighty ingenium and
there was a dull taste in her mouth, and she felt so weak that she made no effort to dry the slow, hot tears that kept rising every minute
at length, as no one else seemed able to settle, hans castorp, with his finger on the glass, supporting his cheek on his fist, said he would like to know what was to be the actual length of his stay up here, instead of the three weeks originally fixed
peeperkorn’s gestures were conclusive, peremptory
there is something so awfully sprightly about him!
he was standing with his sleeves pushed back before the roomy wash-hand-basin, the taps of which shone in the electric light, and gave hardly a glance at the white metal bed with its fresh coverlet
that was hard for all concerned; the gentlemen could understand how hard it was, for one who came from cultured surroundings and had the delicacy of feeling of the upper classes
the inclu- sion of expression in the general appeasement is the innermost principle of musical pretence
the condition is as regular as it is pathetic, this forgetful, credulous self-deception, that attacks even masculine spirits at the hour when the lethal process nears its culmination
it came from the fact that in his neighbourhood steril-
never in all his life had hans castorp heard the word uttered so many times on end as he was hearing it now
hanno gentled, tamed, and en-nobled kai, who loved him tenderly, admired his white hands, and, for his sake, let ida jungmann wash his own with soap and a nail-brush
but the ruling powers, in their penuriousness, had the fire go out directly it stopped snowing—an idiotic rule, an insult to human intelligence
they avoided each other, and for weeks exchanged not a single word
would be a thousand pities if one did not do everything to open to this young scholar the way to the heights of knowledge
the young man set to work in his loggia, clad in one of the light summer suits he had brought up with him when he came—another sign that his first year was rounding out its course
inez's consent, however, which she - on psycho- logical or shall i say material grounds, that is to say for common- sense reasons - had always been more or less ready to give, had been the readier because clarissa, toward the end of the previous year, had left munich and entered on her first engagement in celle on the aller, so that her sister was left alone with a mother of ,vhose bohemian leanings, tame as they ,vere, she disapproved
dh, you wait; i sha not come short
the old lady trembled and locked out of the window whenever she heard a wagon
slept right well, did you?
did i not knovv, like her, that shudder at the spiritual vacuity which reigned in the average gathering, in glaring contrast to the fever- ish excitement induced by the wine, the music, and the under- currents of human relations?
that is no reproach, tony, the consul said sternly
yesterday we had sorrel and currants, but i wish i had not, for permaneder objected so much to the sorrel--he picked the currants out with a fork--that he would not speak to me the whole afternoon, but just growled; and i can tell you, mother, that life is not so easy
institoris might assert that only human beings with strong and brutal in- stincts could create great works; and inez would protes

was it to her, tony buddenbrook, that all this was happening?
but that’s all worth hearing
yes, my dear sir!
he had not heeded the silent entry of the tenth month, but he was arrested by its appeal to the senses, this glowing heat that concealed the frost within and beneath it
the czech wenzel, who had introduced an enlivening variation by closing the gramophone and striking up very expertly on his guitar, laid that instrument aside
in adrian's place - but there is really no sense in putting myself in his place; i would not have tolerated some of the things rudi said
it was eleven o'clock in the morning
this style, this technique, he said, admitted no note, not one, which did not fulfil its thematic function in the whole struc- ture - there was no longer any free note
we hadn’t mentioned it
he sat now with his lips closed, his hands folded in his lap, one leg in its check trouser flung over the other, slightly swinging the foot, which he regarded with an austere expression
the consul read it, letting the long ends of his moustache run through his fingers
lieutenant joachim, laughing and excited, burst upon his cousin in the evening rest-cure
popinet had had nightmares again last night--ah, quel horreur!
it came to pass that he heard from her own lips the tragic formula; and being forearmed, preserved a suitable demeanour and was satisfied with himself afterwards
they fell out, exasperation on religious and philosophical grounds ensued and grew more and more embittered; the upright cleric had everything to endure from the irritability, captiousness, scepticism, and cutting dialectic of young leo
for his part, indeed, he had an enig- matic smile on his lips, a smile that vas far from confirming me as his representative
indeed, to give expression to all that we suspect or divine, we think it not unlikely that hans castorp hearkened to herr settembrini’s discourse in order to get from his own conscience an indulgence which otherwise might not have been forthcoming
they passed along the row of tables, the hofrat letting fall a pleasantry at nearly every one, till a wave of merriment followed in his wake; and so down the steps among the young folk, the female element of which straightway trooped up sidling and becking about dr krokowski, while the hofrat honoured the sabbath by performing a stunt with his bootlaces before the gentlemen’s eyes
his hat rolled a little way off down the road; his fur coat was wet with mud and slush; his hands, in their white kid gloves, lay outstretched in a puddle
will you have some wine?
dh, probably not, the consul said thoughtfully, not ad-dressing anybody in particular
but you do not blame me--?
very early, and in close correspondence with his own averageness, the philis- tine established his personal standards of reasonable behaviour
yes, uncle justus, i thought it was better
herr permaneder let the chance slip and confined himself to laying the blame on herr criinlich, with such violence that his very chin-whiskers bristled
his nose sat like a tiny flat button in his face, his rheek-bones stood out, and his grey eyes, usually drawn close together and blinking about rather stupidly, could at certain moments widen quite extraordinarily, and get larger and larger, pro-truding more and more until they almost sprang out of their sockets
but after all, it seemed, the physician had  nothing particular in mind when he asked the question
what is to happen now?
while i stood profoundly moved at the door
the town was a bishopric in the tenth century, and again from the beginning of the twelfth to the fourteenth
more than that, the news should be to you no news
a violent gust of wind whistled between the houses, lashed the window-panes with rain, and howled down the chimney
and then where can we go?
he shook his head, and pointed several times with violence toward the ground
you are right, ida
the situation is not quite clear; for the dilatory muscles which are presumably set in action by the vasomotor nerves haven’t yet been demonstrated in relation to the blood-vessels
here i lie; can you find it in your heart to say to me: 'i despise you--i am leaving you'?
the possibility of—of a twenty-ninth of february could only be ascribed to feminine receptivity on the basis of the man’s choice already made
it is a regular death-bed, a common death-bed
these are conscientious scruples which—
the greeting he had exchanged with clavdia chauchat had overcome the mortifying depression; it was at bottom the consciousness of this which had lain at the root of hans castorp’s gratification
then she went bathing in the lake—it was the beginning of may; we were having frost at night; the water was not precisely ice-cold, say a few degrees above
may we set it down on the credit side of hans castorp’s account, that he had been strengthened in his vicious time-economy, his baleful traffic with eternity, by seeing that all his cousin’s zeal, called doggedness by a certain melancholy blusterer, had but the more surely brought him to a fatal end?
he took him on business expeditions down to the harbour and let him stand by on the quay while he spoke to the dockers in a mixture of danish and dialect or gave orders to the men who with hollow, long-drawn cries were hauling up the sacks to the granary floor
but in the evening—ah, in the evening there were festivities in the hall and the reception-rooms, in the course of which—but we alone know to what, thanks to hans castorp’s enterprising spirit, these carnival gaieties led up in their course; and we do not mean to let our knowledge betray us into indiscretion
from the alphabet to syntax and grammar, from the progression of numbers and the first rules to the rule of three and simple sums in proportion, from the memorizing of little poems (and there was no memorizing, the verses were straight- way and with the utmost precision grasped and possessed) to the written setting down of his own train of thought on themes out of the geography - it was always the same: adrian gave it his ear, then turned round with an air that seemed to say: yes, good, so much is clear, all right, go on!
yes, of course, hans castorp said
poor little show-window, in which only a few pots of onions stood on a green glass slab
he continued and said:
but was-servogel grunted louder than ever, and a handful of peas went rattling against the window and bounced back into the room
i can still hear you say it, and i thought then that you were right, for i was elected senator, and was fortunate in my business, and this house seemed to spring up out of the ground
of course, it is probably immoral of me that i cannot very well attend to what you say to me about morality for being so happy that we are sitting here as we once did, and then never again, even since you came back
one might think so
when frau permaneder opened the dining-room door in passing, to call a good night to her brother in the living-room, she saw that the whole storey was lighted up, and that thomas was walking up and down with his hands behind his back
it may be helpful to you if i tell you that at your age, both in antwerp and bergen, i formed a habit of making myself useful and agreeable to my principals; and this was of the greatest service to me
five million subscribers, it was calculated, would in the course of twenty years deliver a quantity of old newspaper valued at the enormous sum of  million marks; of which two-thirds might be reckoned off to the new subscriptions, which would thus pay for themselves, the other third, amounting to about a million marks, remaining to be devoted to humanitarian projects, such as financing free establishments for tuberculous patients, encouraging struggling talent, and so on
it will be perfect, she said
she was a thick-set country-bred creature, with coarse lips and fat red cheeks
thomas was not in the mood to think about it
then he suddenly felt the blood rushing to his face as he recalled another memory, from farther back in the past
he wears a black coat--an old one of the consul's--greased leather top-boots, and a blue woollen scarf round his neck
perhaps i am not masculine at all—certainly i am not in the sense which i tend to call social,  i don’t exactly know why
it is comprehensible that johann buddenbr oak's first im-pulse was to refuse his son-in-law any considerable payment
your cousin’s a different sort, quite another pair of shoes
and he held your brother by the coat and begged to be allowed to stop at home-- dh, my brother took him, did he?--yea, that is a hard moment, ida
he burst  out laughing, in a high, half-smothered titter, in his glee at being able to make fun of the catechism
doctor gieseke, said tony
it was like the bursting of a dam--an assertion of desperate integrity; something elemen-tal, a force of nature, that brooked no restraint
and he consented to be present at a spiritualistic sitting, a tabletipping, glass-moving game which they had determined to undertake with ellen brand, behind dr krokowski’s back, and in defiance of his jealous prohibition
but that was no proper uniform he wore
you are certainly right about that, tom, said frau permaneder, letting fall her work and looking at her brother sidewise, past her glasses but not through them
he could see nothing, but he struggled, he came forward
the beech groves came in sight
he only laughed scornfully as he went off, and in a few minutes returned with the revolver in his hand
said frau gr�, folding her ffands in her lap and gazing up at the ceiling
and even with the first rumour of the old man's death, the great question had at once sprung up: who was to succeed him?
and his heart began to thump
he sat up and lighted the bedside candle
it was my duty, my friend, replied the consul
as for adrian, he answered in the negative the question put by the viennese
on the evening when i first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, he said, beginning in a singsong tone, and letting his voice fall at the end, as though embarked on a long recitative, we had a little celebration, sat very late eating and drinking and making merry, and then, in an elevated mood, of spirit free and unrestrained, arm in arm we sought our beds
of the scandalous courses of that royal personage the whole neighbourhood still talked; but rhadamanthus had shut his eye—both eyes, in fact—and behaved every inch a hofrat
the entresol has three rooms, he explained--the breakfast-room, my parents' sleeping-chamber, and a third room which is seldom used
they went down after tea to the basement for the monthly examination
the lively old maid was also invited to meng street on occasion to partake of a haunch of venison or a stuffed goose
they all thought for a while of this strange thing, and then suddenly frau permaneder burst into tears

but we are not indulging in flights of fancy
there are impressions which, unimportant as they seem to the reason, work on in the subconscious mind and there exercise a decisive influence
christian would by himself never have found out the book; but he was impressionable and accessible to every influence; so he also read it, found it wonderful, and described his reactions with all possible de-tail
frau permaneder quickly looked him over and summed him up
one particular dream, however, hans castorp dreamed twice over during the night, both times in precisely the same form, the second time toward morning
the chances and changes of life itself would have called up in them no other reaction
he would open his eyes and look with eager pleasure at the old-fashioned furniture of the cleanly little room
in the long vacation of  and still from kaisersaschern, i, with my young bride, visited adrian and schildknapp in the nest they had found in thr sabine hills
you know, betsy, there is another thing i ca not emphasize often enough: in these last years we have not been doing any too brilliantly
how would it be if we were to go out and take a little walk?
why that particular one?
you are right, young man, or, rather, you mean it well
again, how involved were the relations between the various members of our group!
dh, tom, i do not feel much like chatting pleasantly about trifles!
hanno sat still a moment, his rhin on his breast, his hands in his lap
he wore his sinewy throat uncovered and had no love for city clothes, which did not suit his looks, particularly not his hands, those powerful, browned and parched, rather freckled hands, one of which grasped the crook of his stick when he went into the vil- lage to town meeting
and now came on, as come it must, what hans castorp had never thought to experience: the winter of the place, the winter of these high altitudes
for liars and lickspittles mixed us a poison draught and took away our senses
white blood-corpuscles were attracted to the seat of the evil; the breakingdown proceeded apace; and meanwhile the soluble toxins released by the bacteria had already poisoned the nerve-centres, the entire organization was in a state of high fever, and staggered—so to speak with heaving bosom—toward dissolution
he is hardly even a relative!
but why do i talk so much about elegant society and its itches?
as though circumstances which to herr albin were but an opportunity to enjoy the boundless advantages of shame, were to the young officer a source of chagrin and self-contempt
his father strongly reprehended them
well, young un, i must get on
i would not even suppress my suspicion, held on psychological grounds, that i actually seek digressions and cir- cumlocutions, or at least welcome with alacrity any occasion for such, because i am afraid of what is coming
see you at breakfast!
but frau permanrder was not listening
but their conviction, endorsed by the governing power of the state, had shattered his selfesteem to such a degree that he could not look anybody in the face
dull-eyed and breathless, he stood at the table, collected his despairing senses with a jerk, and began to put together the books he was likely to need to-day, murmuring in an anguished voice: religion, latin, chenb istry, and shuffling together the wretched ink-spotted papei volumes
of course i made no use of the medical attendance, he said, but that was my own affair
he rubbed one hand over the piano's polished surface, gave a shy look at the company, and, somewhat emboldened by the gentle looks of grand-mamma and aunt tony, brought out, in a low, almost a hard voice: the shepherd's sunday hymn,  by uhlanj
then he too stood and wept, tears ran down his cheeks, like those that had smarted the skin of the english officer of marines: those clear drops flowing in such bitter abundance every hour of our day all over our world, till in sheer poetic justice we have named the earth we live in after them; that alkaline, salty gland-secretion, which is pressed from our system by the nervous stress of acute pain, whether physical or mental
young and good-looking, according to all accounts, the schoolmistress answered; she could not say from her own observation
herr settembrini, i am only a student as yet, i am just beginning
also there was active in halle at that time an outstanding latinist, i-ieinrich osiander, at whose feet i ardently desired to sit; and more than that, as i heard from adrian, the course in church history given by professor hans kegel, dd, included an extraordinary amount of material for a student of profane history, which i wished to avail myself of, as i intended to elect history as my subsidiary course
but if the method is beyond him, if he has not enough gift, he will learn absolutely nothing
so far as it came into practical consideration with him, it was regulated by a healthy sense of the fitness of things, which made him as little likely to discuss it as he was to talk about other functional indecencies of which we are all aware, by which our life is conditioned, but on the subject of which we yet preserve bienséance
but there is little or nothing else im-ported
i would just as lief quit, said christian
he took leave of joachim in a spirit of enterprise, when his cousin addressed himself, after breakfast, to the usual round as far as the bench by the watercourse; then, swinging his walking-stick, he took his own way down the road
he saw what i was looking at and took away the slip of paper with fie on a gentleman and brother!
these announcements were no sooner sent out than the old man refused to set foot in the office; and his apathy so in-creased that it took only the most trifling cold to send him to bed, one march day two months after the death of his wife
there is a female arm, you can tell by its delicacy
for, after all, three weeks, twenty-one days, is a considerable stretch of time, too long, at least, for one to see the end at the beginning
if hans castorp was aware of these sentiments they could hardly escape his charmer’s feminine intuition
or else, not very differently from the pastor: ah, dear little one, little blessed one!
hans castorp sometimes pondered over the literary things the italian had said about illness and despair—which he had found incomprehensible, or at least pretended to himself to find them so
it turned out that this woman had been present, mingling unobtrusively in the audience wherever people had been bold enough to perform any of adri- an's music: in lubeck, at the much-ridiculed premiere of his opera; in zurich, in weimar, in prague
everything went according to custom and arrangement, tony brought out a hearty yes, and herr gr� gave his little ahem, beforehand, to clear his throat
i made use of the very evident stimulus of your presence to stir him up to the point of saying his last word on a certain subject
he made a face as if he were on the bourse and somebody had made him a doubtful proposition
the metal casket was hermetically sealed and covered with flowers, the candles burned in their silver holders, the house filled with people, and, surrounded by mourners from near and far, pastor pringsheim stood at the head of the coffin in upright majesty, his impressive head resting upon his ruff as on a dish
we amount to something even without the 'senator
sometimes i find christian a little strange, said madame griinliuh to her brother thomas,
sold me time too, four and twenty years, boundless to the eye, and promised too great things and much fire under the cauldron, to the end that not withstanding i should be capable of the work although it were too hard and my head too shrewd and mocking thereto
but to the cousins ludovico settembrini talked of himself and his early life; whether on the walks they took together, or during the evening in the salon, or perhaps, in the dining-room itself, after a meal, when most of the patients had left and the three sat together at their end of the table, while the waitresses cleared away and hans castorp smoked his maria mancini, which in the third week had regained a little of its savour
all went as before
even christian was disinclined to talk or joke
and your cousin, monsieur?
to say good-bye to adrian, whose personal detachment from the whole scene was the most understandable thing in the world to me, i went out to pfeiffering, whence the son of the house, gereon, had already departed with several horses far his base

he paused at the window and looked out into the early dusk
but she took it up in earnest, whereupon he considered the matter seriously and agreed to make a trial
her face expressed nothing but ill-nature and ignorance

herr ballerstedt had left the room, and his place was taken by a small, weak enervated little man who stood straight and severe on the platform
he must thus have made the discovery that music afforded possibilities for the extension and realization of the kingdom of the spirit, in a way of which young herr ludwig never dreamed
imagine your not seeing that at all

it is the row that goes beforehand that i hate!
you would be obliging me very much by this friendly serv- ice, he ended, with a curious formality
your diviningrod twitches, and knocks
his uncle, nikolaus leverklihn, his father's brother, a respected citizen of kaisersaschern, de- clared himself ready to receive the lad into his house
tony was naturally often in the society of her town friends, or drawn into some assembly or boating party

he went on to speak of the lymphatic tubes and absorbent vessels; described the secretion of the breast milk, which collected lymph from legs, abdomen, and breast, one arm, and one side of the head; described the very delicately constructed filters called lymphatic glands which were placed at certain points in the lymphatic system, in the neck, the arm-pit, and the elbow-joint, the hollow under the knee, and other soft and intimate parts of the body

the frau consul mentioned the disastrous fire which had swept hamburg in may of the year
and it was nothing but his own inward weakness and despair that broke out in this scene before mother and sister

despite his scornful repudiation of the idea that he might lie down and be covered up with hexagonal symmetricality, something within him maundered on, sense or no sense: told him that the feeling of duty which bade him fight against insidious sensory appeasements was a purely ethical reaction, representing the sordid bourgeois view of life, irreligion, philistinism; while the desire, nay, craving, to lie down and rest, whispered him in the guise of a comparison between this storm and a sand-storm on the desert, before which the arab flings himself down and draws his burnous over his head

so he began to live: brooded over by his father's reserved tenderness, clothed nnd nurtured under his mother's watchful eye; prayed over by aunt antonie, presented with tops and hobby-horses by the frau consul and uncle justus; and when his charming little perambulator appeared on the streets, it was looked after with interest and expectation

rather the remarkable and profoundly significant thing was that though the human being, both male and female, was endowed ,vith sex, and although the localization of tj:le d
settembrini cried with ardour, and enlarged upon the cult of the word, the art of eloquence, which he called the triumph of the human genius
he went devotedly to early mass, and took part in the sunday service with a fervour which must have been gratifying to his priestly teachers
he came upon them organically, logically, legitimately—that fact cannot be overemphasized
what is there in notes themselves, that is altogether new?
he laid out his little garden after virgil’s own plan—and all that he said was sane and beautiful
for a long time hans castorp had silently reckoned with the possibility of an advance from the flat-land, and even been fairly sure what personal shape it would take
from pranzo he stalked off with a sour countenance, down the street at dario's side to the farmers and philistines, and i stopped by myself
the corridor made a bend at the point where the stairs mounted to the second storey, and then went on to the back stairs, where there was another, a side entrance into the dining-room
naturally, he could not fail here to come into contact with persons suffering from the disability of which he was free; and so it came to a scene, at which hans castorp was present, and which will serve us as further illustration of our theme
then he flung himself into his chair, and drew out his keepsake, his treasure, that consisted, this time, not of a few reddish-brown shavings, but a thin glass plate, which must be held toward the light to see anything on it
you say nothing save things that are in ine and come out of me but not out of you
even if the act of confession aroused nothing but disgust, and involved great humiliation, still it insured a moment of intimate contact with the beloved object
his eyes were larger than usual and he carried on with her a long and gentle conversation, in the course of which they both stood still, and clara, with a serious, calm voice said her yes
behrens will finally have to make up his mind to the injections, to get rid of my infection; my temperature sticks at ° to four, five, six, and even seven

he and his wife had a way of taking each other's side like this, out of sheer politeness
dazed and grievously afflicted i went up into the fatal room

of the mediterranean, naples, sicily, he knew nothing
she did well, and thrice well, to chastise as unlawful all unconditioned striving after the pure’ knowledge of things—such striving, that is, as is without reference to the spiritual, without bearing on man’s salvation; for it is this unconditioned, this a-philosophical natural science that always has led and ever will lead men into darkness
the sen-ator's bemired clothing hung over a chair
will you have some tea?
only a few lines remained when the servant came through the garden at four o'clock to call him to dinner
tall and broad, he bent toward his neighbour; paused and maintained a marvellously expressive silence
it is not to be, goodness, joy, hope, that was not to be, it would be taken back, it must be taken back!
thus she spoke; and, finishing, sank back exhausted in her chair and stared again out of the window
such an interim form of liv- ing, the entry of city folk, brain workers, into the primitive coun- tryside and back to mother earth, with the knowledge, after all, that we must - or might - soon return to our usual and natu- ral sphere of middle-class comfort: such voluntary screwing down and simplification has easily, almost necessarily something artificial, patronizing, dilettante about it; of this we were humor- ously aware, and knew too that it was the cause of the good- natured, teasing grin with which many a peasant measured us on our request for his hayloft
not all the snow would melt: on the heights to the south, and on the north in the rocky ravines of the rhatikon, some would still remain, and through the summer months more was sure to fall, though it would scarcely lie
but it was high time he came, in any case, behrens says—well, and since then the mother goes about—whenever she is not sitting with them—and if you speak to her, she just says: tous les deux!
he walked so comme il faut, so much as he had always been; he greeted people with his wonted courtliness, he set store, as always, by his outward appearance and bienséance—and he belonged to the earth
joachim, who laid deliberate stress on such occasions, had decorated his place with a few flowers; but there was no great ceremony about the greetings of the other guests, these were almost what they would have been after a separation of three hours instead of three weeks
gerda, sitting with her embroidery or her book, just beyond the portieres, followed the course of the lessons
my thoughts took me far back in our, in his past
for is it mere hypochondria to say to oneself that everything german, even the german mind and spirit, german thought, the german w ord, is involved in this scandalous exposure and made subject to the same distrust?

his nose was of the same shape, above his grizzled moustaches
this oft-repeated phrase set the key for all the running comment with which he accompanied his production of gesture—gesture that by now, in all conscience, had grown more than a little burlesque
he was a better man than herr jonathan or teary trieschke
i flung up my hands, i know, when he came into the management
it seemed to me that he really did drag one foot, but people disputed it; i could not al- ways be sure of it when i saw him walk, and would rather ascribe my impression to a subconscious association with his name
nobody understood metabolism, nobody understood the true inwardness of the functioning of the nervous system
and the organist began to play
he made a vigorous ges-ture and drew himself more erect than before
it is easy to say that a modem theologian takes him symbolically
i am completely discouraged
but then, to avoid giving pause before a miracle—for life that built itself up out of, and fell in decay into, the same sort of matter as inorganic nature, would have been, happening of itself, miraculous—they were driven to believe in a spontaneous generation—that is, in the emergence of the organic from the inorganic—which was just as much of a miracle
have you made up your mind yet about the material for the wedding-dress, tony?
in this disk here are the six cartridges
it would not do
well, what do you say to that?
hans castorp lent him one of his camel’shair rugs, in addition to james’s own plaid; he himself found one cover quite enough this fine autumn weather
no one knew the actual point whence it sprang, where it kindled itself
sledges would skid and upset, rolling their riders into the snow—and the onlookers would take photographs of the scene
until another time, then!
you’ll have to make that a little clearer
he heard another voice, a deep, cold voice, saying: i’ve seen him a long time
one’s not allowed to choose one’s table-mates—that would lead to goodness knows what!
hans castorp, in his simplicity, would sometimes take part
you know what you must do and what leave undone, and that's an end of it
get along with you!
it happened that at the table with adrian sat the old schlaginhaufens, jeanette scheurl, schildknapp, my wife and myself
the frau consul answered only with sobs

during this exposition, the consul had turned his back on his brother, and stood with his hands in his pockets, describing figures on the floor with his foot
but the enterprise of experimenting on nature, of teasing her into manifestations, tempting her, in the sense of laying bare her ,vorkings by experiment; that all this had quite close relations with witch- craft, yes, belonged in that realm and ,vas itself a work of the tempter, such was the conviction of earlier epochs
youthful thirst for adventure, inpatience to be off, were naively mingled with satisfaction at an early re- lease from school

becoming conscious had asserted itself against the world, whether or no the latter had not been quite undecided for recognition

and that was the difference between religion and morality—he was aware that he had put it very badly
but it was just this keeping everybody in ignorance of his mortification, his hatred, his powerlessness, that was so cruelly hard!
you would have to see the minuscule grandezza of his bear- ing as he imitated the two quaint little gentlemen meeting each other on the beach:
as long as division yielded organic units possessing the properties of life—assimilation and reproduction—no limits were set to it
would i sit here if i were constituted a moral judge over you?
his mood was obviously good, and a wave of relief ran through the classroom
come, let me have it; we will lean it against the wall
tony started up indignantly and made a movement to flee into the next room
yes, there is a crib in it
because your companion and i can exchange no kisses on the brow, hans castorp responded
the patient raves no longer: who can say whether his spirit is sunk in empty night or whether it lingers, remote from the flesh, in far, deep, quiet dreams, of which he gives no sound and no sign?

the catastrophe will and must come—it advances on every hand and in every way
a protecting deity, an egeria, a soul-mate?
prometheus too was guilty of hubris— and his torture on the scythian cliffs was from our point of view a holy martyrdom
even riekchen severin was looking insulted at the bottom of the table, and old consul kroger ivas the single one of the company who gave even a subdued snort
this breathless moment of absolute calm came without warning, like some unexpected, soundless, awful event
it is probable that he was merely indulging himself in the regal luxury of being thus supported and piloted; presumably he could have gone by himself
frankly, it took me some tine to understand that on the one hand, indeed, the church did not \ish to see her- self put on one side; but on the other she was not ready to give her parting blessing to a declared suicide, however honourable a one
hans castorp and joachim ziemssen, arrayed in white trousers and blue blazers, were sitting in the garden after dinner
his breath came shorter, he began to cough, hans castorp, with his eyes on his goal, and his breathing apparatus apparently in splendid trim, gave little heed; and joachim, having recognized the situation for what it was, drew his brows together and kept step for step, feeling it out of the question to let his cousin go on alone
for the enemy, aware of their advance, have concentrated a barrage of shrapnel and large-calibre grenades upon the way they must come; it crashed among them in the wood, and howling, flaming, splashing, lashed the wide ploughed land
there is nothing left but to pity and shrug one’s shoulders

as they went along the corridors hans castorp said to his cousin: confess that it was a good idea of mine
the snow-white cloth of woven damask on the round table had an embroidered green runner across it, laid with gold-bordered porcelain so translucent that it gleamed like mother-of-pearl

tony related the good progress of the little erica, and christian wrote eagerly of his life and doings in london
don pizarro, in enormous puffed sleeves, was striking a permanent and awesome attitude, and the minister, in black velvet, approached from behind with hasty strides, to turn all to happiness
and by his own fault, one must admit
that would have meant denying to the

we can’t deny that you had a weakness that way; we make no bones of it, even if it is as good as cured now, and it may easily be that it runs a little in the family, as behrens suggested

the naiad, the halmstadt, the friederike (jverdieck--why, if you know those, my son, at least that's soiiething!
hans castorp did not keep inward count of the time, as does the man who husbands it, notes its passing, divides and tells and labels its units
there he lay, and dictated to his attendant letters that betrayed extreme depression
i’ve just come from an unequal duel with saw and scalpel—great thing, you know, resection of ribs
it’s so in the majority of cases, at bottom—i know what death is, i am an old retainer of his; and believe me, he’s overrated
here i will follow on with a letter i had from him two months after i entered the service at naumburg
it is as though some-thing had begun to slip--as though i have not the firm grip i had on events--what is success?
hans castorp thought it a disinterested horror, yet with something too of a personal kind, something that touched the kingly creature near: fear, perhaps, but not of any mean or narrow sort; that was very like panic flickering up momentarily in the eyes
let him stop up here a bit, look about him and get used to things, he would change his tune
and now, good appetite, and a good morning
with outraged virtue and dignity she would call by name all those persons who had played havoc with her life and, in consequence, with the prestige of the buddenbrook family; the list had grown long with time: teary trietschke!

the dreary, tossing sea was covered far and wide with foam
the whole occurrence, however, took a peculiar cast, offensive even beyond the horror of it, through an association of ideas due to dr krokowski’s latest lecture

theie was a half-circle of potted plants, arranged alternately with high silver candelabra; and against the dark green leaves gleamed from a black pedestal the marble copy of thorwaldsen's christ, which belonged in the corridor outside
he said, with a sad head-shake

there's nothing good to be looked for from christian, and i am finished
she spoke of the free and frank dis-cussion which the constitution ordains must be held over each name upon the list of candidates, and vivaciously wished she might be present when hermann hagenstrom's character was being pulled to pieces!
the ladies’ palpitation and cold extremities, the forced hilarity of the men, arose from their knowledge that they were come together in the night to embark on an unclean traffic with their own natures, a fearsome prying into unfamiliar regions of themselves, and that they were awaiting the appearance of those illusory or halfrealities which we call magic
she was admitted into the salon, where thomas buddenbrook lay upon his bier
he slipped into it and assumed an air of having been here from the beginning
the clock strikes twelve,

item, she has much of the laboratory and the insistent ac- tivity of the alchemists and nigromancers of yore, which also stood in the sign of theology, but at the same time in that of emancipation and apostasy; it ,vas apostasy, not from the feith, that was never possible, but in the feith; for apostasy is an act of feith and everything is and happens in god, most of all the falling from him
alone with his cousin, hans castorp heaved a sigh
i owe that to my family and the firm, she added earnestly
then frau per-maneder breathed such a heavy sigh that it sounded like a sob
no doubt hans castorp, were he wishful to do so, could without any great trouble have reckoned himself into certainty; just as the reader can, in case all this vagueness and involvedness are repugnant to his healthy sense
it was not meant for people who went out in the snow and got lost and night-bound in the mountains
your tales cf the whip-cracking and sprjnging to order, the curry- combing and spit-and-polish, have made us heartily to laugh: above all that one of the under-officer ,vhich even as he planes
he said we should sitty down and so we did, with the manikin between us in the grass, and looked at his picture-book vith him
his father, of whom he spoke with respect, obviously with the feeling that he was now remote enough from his native scene to view it with impartial benevolence, had been the village schochet, or slaughterer—a calling different indeed from that of the gentile butcher, who was labourer and tradesman, whereas leo’s father was an official, and the holder of a spiritual office
and since, in order to remain within the moral code, such a man had always to correct justice in the second sense by justice in the first, where then was the absolute, the radical, in the conception?
he shows an unpretentious façade, and behind it gives free rein to tastes— such as a prince of the church—
directly the doctors had left the scene, the word had gone round for a dance, already the tables were being pushed back; spies were posted at the doors of the writing- and music-rooms, with orders to give the sign in case the old man, krokowski, or the oberin should show themselves
he went about with that dry flush on his face and hummed continually under his breath—being in a state of mind when music particularly appeals

i was still happier over the altogether successful shaping of the address, only nine lines long, of the poet to his allegorical song, which speaks so darkly and difficultly, with no prospect of its hidden sense being understanded of the ,vorld
he asked, after silence had reigned some two minutes
but however genuine his fear of the elements, he refused to take premature flight; his being scarcely the sportman’s attitude, who only meddles with the elements so long as he knows himself their master, takes all precautions, and prudently yields when he must—whereas what went on in hans castorp’s soul can only be described by the one word challenge
so james broke off, and to his nephew’s further, mildly interested query answered: oh, nothing
no, thomas, you simply ca not understand what a splendid creature she is--and healthy--she is as healthy--!
yes, the sleeping-sack, hans castorp said
now look at the skin—the epidermis
a nice, amusing young man—but what was the result?

he stood there near the figure of thorwaldsen's christ and wrung his hands before his face or spread them out in blessing; while below in the street, before the house door, beneath a white wintry sky, stood the hearse drawn by four black horses, with the other carriages in a long row behind it

the window was down, the afternoon grew cool, and he, a tender product of the sheltered life, had turned up the collar of his fashionably cut, silk-lined summer overcoat
the richest children were pointed out, the prettiest and those from well-known families: there were the little daughter of a dutch multi-millionaire, the son of a prussian prince, and a twelve-year-old lad who bore the name of a champagne known the world over

it had been standing here, in immovable dignity, while she had thought of it as a dream worthy only to be forgotten
joachim made a right-about turn
i beg your pardon, i will ask another question; i’ll put it more simply and generally
and mynheer peeperkorn came to the point
whereupon the young man laughed, blushed again, and looked at tony's plate
a drive bordered with chestnut trees went from the garden gate up to the ter-race; and on either side of the gate a gilt-topped lantern was burning brightly
a door was slammed—it was the one on the left, leading into the hall, and someone had let it fall shut, or even banged it, a thing he detested; he had never been able to endure it
i have already spoken of adrian's inner cosmopolitanism

tony was speechless with envy and humiliation
that is strong language, ida, but that was really the truth of it
he held these offices in high regard
the kind i mean consists in making a good use of favours received
the volumes were heavy, unhandy
before tea was finished drinking, up above and down below, it was well on the way toward five o’clock; and by the time joachim returned from his third daily round and looked in on his cousin, it would be near enough to six to reduce the remaining rest period to no more than a single hour—reckoned always in round numbers
upon my word, one has only to speak of her to make you blush!
but hold—you need a bag, a fur sack!
for twice such a turn had come, in his dream and fantasy, as had made him start up—once from horror, and again for rapture
but so long as this is the case, heinricy, you cannot expect to make any improvement, and so i warn you
this was all that was lacking to set the crown upon the whole
this undress threw into even greater relief the splendid humanity of his head on the pillow; in it he looked more remote than ever from the conventional and middle-class, suggesting on the one hand the homme du peuple, on the other a portrait-bust
was it that he missed the orange perfume?
hans castorp felt how very odd indeed the word sounded in the mouth of sharp, skinny little naphta

it was capable of healing certain diseases which were latent in every human being, though its first effects were strongly favourable to these, and by dint of a general organic compulsion, upwards and outwards, made them come to the surface, brought them, as it were, to a triumphant outburst—beg pardon—triumphant?—yes; had he never felt that an outbreak of disease had something jolly about it, an outburst of physical gratification?

you have there ensenbles which begin as speaking choruses and only by stages, by the way of the most extraordinary transitions, turn into the richest vocal music; then choruses which pass through all the stages from graded whisper- ings, antiphonal speech, and humming up to the most polyphonic song - accompanied by sounds which begin as inere noise, like tom-toms and thundering gongs, savage, fanatical, ritual, and end by arriving at the purest music
they had him between them, and he turned his head to assent first to one and then to the other; now and again he stood stock-still on the path, tipping his body back from the waist and gesturing with his fur-lined glove as he made some quite inadequate contribution to the talk

then there were cavaliers of herr albin’s kidney, monocled youths of seventeen, a spectacled, rosyfaced young dutchman with a mania for collecting postage stamps; certain greeks, with pomaded hair and almond-shaped eyes, inclined to overreach at table; and a pair of young dandies who were nicknamed max and moritz, and bore a great reputation for breaking out of bounds
in july he was as sound as a berry, weeks long
while the departure of the civilian hans castorp became impossible precisely because he had to wait for clavdia chauchat, whose return, as yet, was not even thought of

during the meal her mother had told her that thomas was aware of her expected arrival; and she did not seem particularly anxious to meet him
white traces lingered after every storm in the crannies of the rocky rhätikon, the chain that seemed to guard the end of the valley, and the distant monarchs to the south were always in snow
he thanked me in the words, spoken so far as i could hear without humour: well, you see, it is a good thing after all to have reliable friends
and yet there were troubles which had, at times, the power to lame his courage for hours, weaken his elasticity, and depress his mood

tony, your position is not comme il faut, remarked the frau consul

since then he encompassed in his reveries this nervous, exceedingly reserved lady, to whom he had not even been presented: he lifted his jesuit hat to her, on the street, to her great surprise, and treated her to a pantomime of cringing treachery, gloating over her the while in his thoughts as a tiger might over his trainer
i can speak openly with you
man is intoxicated by his desire, woman demands and expects to be intoxicated by it
his youthful moustaches, colourless as the hair which covered his long head, were scarcely visible; and he had a complexion to match, a tint like translucent porcelain, which grew pink on the slightest provocation
his feet looked large, his legs very thin, they seemed to be bound or wound as for the business of sport more than war

toward the end of the month the valley lay deep in snow; but then it thawed, just as certain experienced or weather-sensitive among the guests had prophesied it would: frau stöhr, the ivory levi, but equally the widow hessenfeld, smelt and felt it simultaneously, before ever the smallest little cloud showed itself over the top of the granite formation to the south

the musical followed and admired the art of his phrasing, his breathing-technique
theol- ogy was to them something given - and something historically gi ven it certainly is
it’s not only since yesterday that i’ve been thinking about it
behrens studied the spots and the lines, the black festoon in the intercostal space; while hans castorp gazed without wearying at joachim’s graveyard shape and bony tenement, this lean memento mori, this scaffolding for mortal flesh to hang on
his hair, pale brown and very soft, began to grow rapidly, and fell waving over the shoulders of his full, pinafore-like frocks
it was a beneficent pause, relaxed, and filled with peaceful satisfaction in respect of work already accomplished

a trembling ran through her, she sighed, the upper part of her body sank forward so that her forehead rested against hans castorp’s, and her arms, together with those of her guardians, began to make extraordinary pumping motions to and fro
and we are shrinking shadows by the way-side, shamed by the security of our shadowdom, and noways minded to indulge in any rodomontade; merely led hither by the spirit of our narrative, merely to see again, among those running, stumbling, drum-mustered grey comrades that swarm out of yonder wood, one we know; merely to look once more in the simple face of our one-time fellow of so many years, the genial sinner whose voice we know so well, before we lose him from our sight
the man whose strength is unexhausted climbs boldly up into the lofty multiplicity of the mountain heights
the cigarettes, those biting little trifles with the yellow mouthpiece, were tom's passion
he stood and watched her laugh as she spoke, precisely as pribislav hippe had laughed as he spoke, that time in the school yard: she opened her mouth rather wide, and her slanting, grey-green eyes narrowed themselves to slits above the cheek-bones
three times daily, at least, she passionately embraced her future sister-in-law
after an introductory c, it puts a c sharp before the d, so that it no longer scans heav-en's blue, mead-owland, but o-thou heaven's blue, green-est meadowland, fare-thee well for aye, and this added c sharp is the most moving, consolatory, pa- thetically reconciling thing in the world

he, thomas buddenbrook, as a business man, was taking advantage of the market--and he would, by god, when he sold, know how to do the same
the truth was that his very destiny had been marked by stages, adventures, insights, and these flung up in his mind suitable themes for his stock-taking activities, and these, in their turn, ripened him into an intuitional critic of this sphere, of this its absolutely exquisite image, and his love of it
so 'tis; yes, they do say so
and had not the establishment of the morning star been, precisely, a military academy, the pupils of which were drilled by divisions in military and spiritual decorum, a mingling, so to speak, of stand-up collar and spanish ruff?

edmund pfu'hl was an organist of no small repute, whose reputation for contrapuntal learning was not confined within the walls of his native town

blatant self-confidence lured everyone on to try his hand
all i want to say is that our objections - if they are meant as objec- tions - would not count against the fulfilment of the old, the ever repeated demand to take hold and make order, and to resolve the magic essence of music into human reason

so while these youthful lips meet in their russian kiss, let us darken our little stage and change the scene
in the morning he went to the office at about the same time as thomas, and sat opposite his brother and herr marcus in a revolving arm-chair like theirs
he had what he had
did not the very fact that he was sitting at the bad russian table witness a certain abandon?
he came to her rescue and launched out once more upon the old story
thank you so much, professor naphta
between them there had appeared, lifting his top hat, a gentleman of scarcely medium height, with one light eyebrow higher than the other and the pointed ends of his moustaches extending beyond his pallid cheeks

this is not just a machine, he went on, taking a needle out of one of the gay little metal boxes ranged on the table, and fitting it into the holder, it’s a stradivarius, a guarneri; with a resonance, a vibration—dernier raffinemang, polyhymnia patent, look here in the inside of the lid

and i, on the other hand, assert that the question of freedom—the question of cities, to put it more concretely—has always been a highly ethical question, and is historically bound up with the inhuman degeneration of commercial morality, with all the horrors of modern industrialism and speculation, and with the devilish domination of money and finance

hans castorp was in his loggia, studying a plant which, now that the astronomical summer had begun, and the days were shortening, flourished luxuriantly in many places: the columbine or aquilegia, of the ranunculus family, which grew in clumps, with long stalks bearing the blue, violet, or reddish-brown blossoms, and spreading herbaceous foliage
yes, he said, joachim would find there had been changes in the population of the berghof, there were new people, but on the other hand, some that had gone away were come back again

war, echoed settembrini, war, my dear sir, has been forced before now to serve the cause of progress; as you will grant if you will recall certain events in the history of your favourite epoch—i mean the period of the crusades
precisely this it was that frightened hans castorp; for frightened he was, in the same sense as when, in the consulting-room, he had looked from joachim’s nude body with panic-stricken searching up to his eyes—only that then the grounds of his fear had been pity and concern, whereas here something quite different was in play
except for the first greeting, he had had no opportunity to speak with christian, but he had looked at him, during the service, and noted that he seemed unusually serious, and even more restless than common: in the course of pastor pringsheim's discourse he had left the room for several minutes

was not he himself used to lie long hours out of doors, in snow and frost, by night as well as day?
his face grew slowly red--such a dark red that his beard looked pale-yellow by contrast
that’s too absurd for words
oh, you, with your cassandra prophecies!
hans castorp set himself against it—or at least he tried, only to discover, in affright, that even he was powerless to do so
his thoughts, whenever he paused in his address, obvi- ously made him inaccessible to them

yes, i vvould go so far as to reckon ,vith the possibility that i-ielmut himself knevl the truth: a certain admixture of cul- tured decency, deprecating and regretful toleration, and -love of peace, speal{s for the supposition, and it does happen far from seldom that society takes the spouse for the only blind one, while he thinks that except for limself no one knows anything

the munich i speak of is the munich of the late regency, with only four years between it and the war, whose issue was to turn its pleasantness to morbidness and produce in it one sad and gro- tesque manifestation after another; this capital city of beautiful vistas, where political problems confined themselves to a capri- cious opposition between a half-separatist folk-catholicism and the lively liberalism professed by the supporters of the reich; munich, with its parade concerts in the feldherrenhalle, its art shops, its palaces of decorative crafts, its recurring exhibitions, its bauern-balls in carnival time, its seasonal marzhrliu carouses and week-long monster fair on the oktoberwiese, 'where a stout and lusty folkishness, now long since corrupted by modern mass methods, celebrated its saturnalia; munich, ,vith its residuary wagnerism, its esoteric coteries performing their resthetic devo- tions behind the siegestor; its bohemia, well bedded down in pub- lic approval and fundamentally easy-going
in the evening, after he had drunk his beer, hans castorp felt heavier in the limbs and more chilled and exhausted than on the day before; toward nine o’clock he bade his cousin good-night, drew his plumeau up to his chin, and slept like the dead

his trousers were of an indefinite grey-green colour and too short

and there could be on earth nothing more tender than the next number he chose: a duet from a modern italian opera, a simple, heartfelt mingling of emotion between two beings, one part taken by the world-famous tenor who was so well represented in the albums, the other by a crystal-clear and sweet little soprano voice; nothing more lovely than his da mi il braccio, mia piccina and the simple, sweet, succinct little melodic phrase in which she replies
for long before i dal- lied with the poison butterfly, my froward soul in high mind and arrogance was on the way to satan though my goal stood in doubt; and from youth up i worked towards him, as you must know, indeed, that man is made for hell or blessedness, made and foredestined, and i was born for hell

in his wizened red hand he holds a bunch of pale-coloured roses, which are a little past their best, and slowly shed their petals on the carpet
hans castorp expressed it: a cigar like that is alive—it breathes
when it was over, the cousins walked down to the platz; joachim seemed preoccupied; hans castorp was in an agony of snuffles and cleared his rasping throat continually
the two clasped hands through the open window
yes, you bought me a glass of lemonade from the next booth
then the senator got up from his chair, which fiete drew away behind him, and went with shuffling steps into his office to get a cigar

he might say it with his head thrown back, his nose wrinkled up, mouth wide open, hands swishing about in the air, with a long-drawn-out, nasal, metallic sound, like a chinese gong; or he might, with still funnier effect, toss it out, gently, en passant; or with any one of a thousand different shades of tone and meaning

the balcony ran across the house and was divided into small separate compartments by opaque glass partitions, which did not quite reach to the balustrade
there is in all this monstrousness nothing that could appeal to the likes of me as goodness, beauty, greatness; and i shall never un- derstand the glory-to-god mental attitude which certain tem- peraments assume when they contemplate the works of god, meaning by the phrase the physics of the universe

but the distinction was not such a simple one to make
in short, it might even be said that such an excursion was more fitting, morally spoken, than many another, than the cinematograph or the bob-sleigh races, for example—and surely it was no more than proper to make those lying up there a visit once in a way, as a comradely attention, provided one did not regard it as in the same class with an ordinary walk or excursion to a point of interest

the other trees of the region, whether towering or stunted, were evergreen pines and firs, invincible against the assaults of this irregular winter, which might scatter its snow-storms through all the months of the year: only the many-shaded, rust-red tone that lay over the forest gave notice, despite the glowing sunshine, of a declining year

then he mustered his english to inquire of his neighbour on the right what sort of tea she was drinking (it was made of rose-hips) and if it tasted good, which she almost passionately affirmed; then he watched people coming and going in the room; the first breakfast, it appeared, was not regarded as a regular meal, in any strict sense

it drove him on, in hanno's presence, to self-assertion
and still, in those eyes, especially when they gave a side glance, as they often did, there was that timid and defensive look; while the mouth closed with the old, woebegone expression which he had had even as a baby, or went slightly crooked when he explored the recesses of his mouth for a defective tooth
she dismissed the cousins with thanks and expressions of friendliness, which could not but touch them, considering her distressed state, and the bill for oxygen her departed husband had left behind him
youths were at work with horses, running hand on halter alongside their whinnying, head-tossing charges; pulling the refractory ones on a long rein, or else, seated bareback, striking the flanks of their mounts with naked heels, to drive them into the sea

it was a harmless little stone, the size of a hen's egg, flung by the hand of some chris snut or heine voss to cele-brate the revolution; certainly not with any bad intent, and probably not directed toward the carriage at all
the worst, the actually torturing thing, was the silence
but in a few minutes his eyes had roved from the printed page, and he sat for a long time without changing his position, gazing straight ahead of him between the portieres into the darkness of the salon
we want freedom, morten said

progress, up to now, had had to do, in hans castorp’s mind, with such things as the nineteenthcentury development of cranes and lifting-tackle
with the intention of detracting from its weight, and so causing it to be forgotten - or more correctly, probably, to make it, out of pride, look as though that were the idea; for i do not believe the intention existed that i, the reader, should overlook the core of the letter
soon after the holidays herr gr� went back to ham-burg, for his flourishing business demanded his personal at-tention; and the buddenbrooks agreed with him that tony had had time enough before the betrothal to make his ac-quaintance the question of a house was quickly arranged
he had succeeded to the headship of the school after the death, soon after , of the genial and benevolent old gentleman under whose guidance hanno's father and uncle had pursued their studirs
listen to the obsolete chord; even by itself alone it stands for a technical general position which contradicts the actual
in its simplified form the melody is sung straight through; whereas in the original art-song, the key changes to minor in the second of the eight-line stanzas, changes back again with beautiful effect to major in the fifth line; is dramatically resolved in the following bitter blasts and facing the tempest; and returns again only with the last four lines of the third stanza, which are repeated to finish out the melody
and as i have never forgotten it or the knowledgeable old codger who coined it, i think it must be counted to his honour by the posterity he invoked as witness against his spineless and torpid fellow-critics
i myself had seen the good child with adrian in the abbot's room: he reclined in the bernheim chaise-longue while she sat very stiff-backed in the savonarola chair at the table and in touchingly plaintive, painfully high-ger- man schoolgirl accents read aloud out of a discoloured old card- board volume
thus he could take in the child- like solemnity and esoteric mystery of the magic flute, the for-

as a business man, believe me, i am better informed than the diplomats, and the fear that we should lose independence and freedom of action is simply laughable in this case
at this point a darkening of hans castorp’s brows made wehsal desist, though it had more reference to the presence of the good-natured ferge, with his shrinking from the higher flights of conversation, than to any moral censorship on the part of our hero
i heard your name once or twice-- you heard my name?

i actually want to—
he sauntered over to his nephew's place, with a diamond ring on his finger, a present from his mother; and his pleasure in the toy theatre was as unaffected as hanno's own
then he leaned back his head and closed his eyes
went through the audience, and one lady, radbruch the publisher's wife, was encouraged by zur hohe's words to say: one thinks one is hearing poetry
morten shouted, quite insulted
but you mean well, you mean much better, and more to my mind, than that knife-edged little jesuit and terrorist, apologist of the inquisition and the knout, with his round eye-glasses—though he is nearly always right when you and he come to grips over my paltry soul, like god and the devil in the mediæval legends

clavdia chauchat had exchanged the customary sweater for a frock with a hint of the fanciful about it, suggesting a national costume—russian peasant, or balkan, perhaps bulgarian; a light-coloured, flowing, and girdled arrangement, embroidered, and set with tiny tinsel ornaments
he had—that is, the house possessed among its volumes of records—a certain song, from gounod’s faust, valentine’s prayer, baritone with orchestral accompaniment, very appealing

herr gr�, betsy--a friend of mine and a keen man of business
the water was running!
scarcely did it leave him time to follow with the pen the haunting and hunting inspirations which gave him no rest, which made hiln their slave
you are telling the truth
to work at his play, to play at his work, to bend an ambition that was half-earnest, half-whimsical, toward the accomplishment of aims that even to himself possessed but a symbolic value--for such blithe scepticism and such an enlightened spirit of compromise, a great deal of vitality is necessary, as well as a sense of humour

listen to which a man in extreme agony of soul had called to- gether his fellow-men - an act of fantastic good faith, moreover, for one's fellow-men are not meant or made to face such truth otherwise than with cold shivers and with the conclusion that, when it vvas no longer possible to regard it as poetry, they very soon unanimously and audibly came to about it

the stamp of old-world, underground neurosis which i have been describing, the mark and psychological temper of such a town, betrays itself in kaisersaschem by the many originals, eccentrics, and harmlessly half-mad folk who live within its walls and, like the old buildings, belong to the picture

hans castorp was alone among four walls with his wonder-box; with the florid performance of this truncated little coffin of violin-wood, this small dull-black temple, before the open double doors of which he sat with his hands folded in his lap, his head on one side, his mouth open, and let the harmonies flow over him
as if hans castorp had been intending to handle it carelessly or keep it after the hour!

a hungarian student played spirited gipsy waltzes on his fiddle; and hofrat behrens, who chanced to be present for a quarter-hour with dr krokowski, got somebody to play the melody of the pilgrims’ chorus on the bass notes of the piano, while he himself operated in a skipping movement with a brush over the treble, and parodied the violin counterpoint

no one from then henceforward heard anything from him
vorl{ of the soul, in a court of appeal interceding, mediating, itself instinct with poetry; where spirit and desire interpenetrate and appease each other in a way not quite free from illusion; it is a stratum of life peculiarly informed with sentiment, in ,vhich, i confess, my own humanity feels at ease, but which is not for i;tronger tastes
then, as the shameless disturbance did not stop, she had with trembling hands kindled a light, had left her bed, thrilling with horror, repulsion, and despair, had opened the door and hurried out on to the landing in her slippers, the light in her hand--to the top of the ladder that went straight up from the house door to the first storey

thus in my friend's musical fabric a five- to six-note series, beginning with b and ending on e flat, \\lith a shifting e and a between, is found strikingly often, a basic figure of peculiarly nostalgic character, which in differing harmonic and rhythmic garb, is given now to this part no,v to that, often in its inversion, as it were turned on its axis, so that while the intervals remain the sanle, the sequence of the notes is altered

suous simultaneity - most magnificent and heavy with meaning, if a bit too clever after all, in comparison with certain revelations of the elemental in the art of the pure musicians, beethoven and bach; for example, in the prelude to the cello suite of the latter - also an e-flat major piece, built up in primitive triads

no, that is certainly news to me
the world, this narrow, lofty, isolated world up here, looked now well wadded and upholstered indeed: no pillar or post but wore its white cap; the steps up to the entrance of the berghof had turned into an inclined plane; heavy cushions, in the drollest shapes, weighed down the branches of the scotch firs—now and then one slid off and raised up a cloud of powdery white dust in its fall

he had never heard of the ecclesiastical conception of indulgence, under which was to be classified one of the sacraments of the church—namely, marriage, not in itself an absolute good, like the other sacraments, but only a protection against sin, countenanced in order to set bounds to sensual desire; that the ascetic principle, the ideal of complete chastity, might be upheld, without at the same time opposing an unpolitic harshness to the flesh?

where love of wisdom lifts itself to contemplation of the highest essence, the source of being, the study of god and the things of god, there, one might say, is the peak of scientific dignity, the highest and noblest sphere of knowledrre, the apex of all thinking; to the inspired intellect its most exalted goal is here set

do not shriek like that--control yourself, for god's sake!
it is still alrnost nothing, what lies underneath, by comparison with all there is on top; we give time, plenteous time, abundant time by the eye, the end whereof we do not need to consider, not for a long time yet, nor need to trouble yet awhile even of the point of time where you could begin to take heed to the ending, where it might come to  arespice finez

he saw him stand, of an evening, in the card-room, among the other guests, quite lost in gazing at the lovely, contaminate creature on the sofa in the small salon, in talk with the whimsical, fuzzy-haired tamara, dr blumenkohl, and the hollow-chested, stooping young men who were her table-mates

it is even as tlugh our mjldly slumbering thuringian ,vere woke up to a sevcn-hundred--thou- £and-man ilpudence and smattered abhominably, ja,v stuck out - horrible, dreadful, but, god i(eep us, certes meaning no harm, and mixed with self-mockery which they can graunt unto them- selves on the ground of their world-pulse
it is really rather frightening
i am astonished that such a stupid goose as i am have to tell you this--yes, i am a stupid goose, and i should not be surprised if permaneder never loved me at all, for i am an ugly old woman, very likely, and babette is certainly prettier than i am!
so that at the decisive moment i wasn’t where all the others were, but behind the scenes, as you call it; as i go along the corridor, they come toward me, in their lace robes, with the cross in front, a gold cross with lanterns—it made me think of the schellenbaum they march with, in front of the recruits
but hanno regained some little strength, consciousness returned; and though the crisis which he had survived  greatly hindered his progress in walking and talking, there was no longer any immediate danger to be feared
tell me, what do you think about greatness?
one might have asked: and the good man too?
nobody could say he broke his word
one might with truth say that he who was worthy of the one was fully worthy of the other

nowadays he too turned mottled when he changed colour, being too copper-tinted to grow really pale
if this foible added a quaint touch to his appearance, yet the effect was only of a slight negligence or licence due to age, which length of days either consciously and cheerfully permits itself, or else brings in its train without the victim’s being aware

during the years of approach- ing defeat and ever more gnawing stringency, he was, thank god, on the schweigestill farm as tolerably cared for as one could wish, without knowledge or appreciation of the state of things, almost unaffected by the slowly corroding changes under which our blockaded and invested country suffered, evell while militarily still on the offensive
that too was a work of immaturity
he sang the praises of the middle ages for forbidding the taking of interest
his face, with its light eyebrows, seemed serious and attentive as he worked; but his thoughts travelled far away in the dark on their lonely, painful path

yes, if you will pardon me, i will take down this picture, there’s positively no light here where it hangs, permit me to carry it over to the sofa, we shall see if it won’t look entirely— what i meant to say was: what is the main concern of the study of medicine?
it was absorbing to watch these ghostly pranks; one needed to keep alert to follow the transmutations, the veiling and unveiling

truly, she bloomed anew in these weeks; and their invigorating activity, the manifold plans, the search for suitable quarters, and the feverish preoccupation with furnishings brought back with such force the memories of her first betrothal that she could not but feel young again--young and boundlessly hopeful

every trace of strain was gone from the features, they had composed themselves, growing cold, into a silent purity of form

she shook her bird-like old head vig-orously, and her brown eyes were clouded with her distress
frau permaneder had hardly, with her sleepy senses, taken them in before she interpreted them as well, in such a way that she felt the blood leave her cheeks and rush to her heart, which contracted and then went on beating with heavy, oppressed pulsations

they all took part settembrini, naphta, hans castorp, ferge and wehsal—one and all slightly feverish, at once nervously stimulated and physically lethargic from walking and talking in the severe frost, all subject to fits of shivering, and—whether principals in the argument, like settembrini and naphta, or for the most part receptive, like the others, contributing only short ejaculations from time to time—all, without exception, so utterly absorbed that they stopped several times by the way, in a disorderly, gesticulating knot, blocking the path of the passersby, who had to describe a circle to get round them
it was not an optical toy which the guests discovered one evening in the salon, and greeted with applause, some of them flinging their hands above their heads, others stooping over and clapping in their laps

it was a capital painting, by an artist of some note, in an old-masterish style that suited the subject and was reminiscent of much spanish, dutch, late middle ages work
he spoke again soon, this time on beethoven and the fugue
it did not cost anything, either, remarked herr gratjens drily--he certainly ought to have known--and studied the wall-painting through the hollow of his hand

mais c’est vrai, you are a little bourgeois
as hans castorp looked rather mortified, he added in his most charming manner: we all know you for a wag, engineer: but your sly quips at the expense of the true, the good, and the beautiful will never make me doubt your fundamental love of them

but as in the spiritual life everything is interrelated, one thing growing out of another, and since one may not reach out one’s little finger to the devil, lest he take the whole hand, and therewith the whole man; since, on the other side, a sound principle can produce only sound results, no matter which end one begins at—so disease, far from being something too refined, too worthy of reverence, to be associated with dullness, is, in itself, a degradation of mankind, a degradation painful and offensive to conceive

the word is made for praise and honlage; to the word it is given to astonish, to admire, and to bless; it may characterize a phenomenon through the emotion it arouses; but it cannot con- jure up or reproduce
i am unfortunately without talent in that line, but i did what i could to encourage the mostly recalcitrant rudiger to visit pfeiffering
one would have to be as old as grandfather for that; in these days, save for him and his old fiete, nobody, far and wide, wore such collars and neckcloths

they had looked dreamy all the evening; but now they stared into the candle-flame with a cold sharp gaze
but alongside the religious cast his reading took another direc- tion, which in certain times would have been characterized as wanting to speculate the elements

but why do you ask?
everywhere one saw people absorbedly bent over cameras supported in the pit or their stomachs, focusing and snapping the shutter; and floods of snapshots were handed round at table

dr gieseke regretted being obliged to explain to her that neither the affair on the stairs nor the insult she had undoubtedly received, the pre-cise nature of which she hesitated to divulge, was sufficient ground for a divorce
then he slackened his pace, and finally almost stopped, as it seemed to him he must have got a good distance ahead of joachim
yes, she was unchanged
in my opinion the wretch, aside from satisfying his lust, had aimed at her death
but that was in his dreams—the waking hans castorp was no such matter, but a much less untrammelled person; not disinclined, either, on the whole, to try out the influence upon himself of this novel human type, with its critical animus and acumen, despite the fact that he found the italian both carping and garrulous

after dinner, during the social half-hour, hans castorp came out of the music-room to look for his cousin, and saw him by the tiled stove, near marusja’s rocking-chair, which joachim held tipped back with his left arm, so that she looked up in his face from a half-lying posture, with her round brown eyes, and he bent over her, talking softly and disjointedly

a pair of stairs led up to the first storey, where the consul opened a white door and admitted his guests to the billiard-room
the hortensia had been like homage at a ball, the brief chat with the two fine young cavaliers a tiny affaire de cœur; she, the mother, had seen it

hans castorp asked him succinctly, with the air of a connoisseur, circumstances betraying him to this tone
that the long-forgotten pribislav hippe should appear to him in the guise of frau chauchat and look at him with those kirghiz eyes—this was to be immured, not with opportunity, but with the inevitable, the unescapable, to such an extent as to fill him with conflicting emotions
there is no question of an extension

he circles directly overhead, he hovers, not a single beat of his wing—at a tremendous height in the blue, and with his keen, far-sighted eyes under the prominent bony structure of his brows he is peering earthwards
no, no, he said, we’ll stop at the covers

inez did not nurse her children ler- self, the family doctor having advised against it
the garden was full of young buds and bathed in tender sun-shine; a pair of birds called and answered each other pertly
the consul could not look at him enough as they sat and drove

it was a prophecy whose slighting note would have been harder to bear had he not known that prophecies are sometimes made in order that they may not come to pass—as a spell, indeed, against their fulfilment
but once in a way he would stop rather longer, standing there broad-shouldered and sturdy, ever with his manly smile, chatting with the comrade of this and that: the weather, the various departures and new arrivals, the mood the patient was in, whether good or bad; sometimes about his personal affairs, origin and prospects—before he uttered the formula: good day to you and passed on
then the wife in justifiable wrath had left him, and for the rest of his life he had seen himself confined to the unaccommodating idol

finally they sent her to davos, but that seemed to have been the finishing touch, for she died there almost at once, just as she had wished and wanted it, and if she had been right in her idea that everything had been evened up by the readiness for death, then she ,vas quits and had got what she was after

he let himself down sidewise on one of the high-backed chairs around the dining-talle, and held his hat and stick between his thin knees
but on the whole he was sound and fit, an adequate tennis player and rower; though actually handling the oars was less to his taste than sitting of a summer evening on the terrace of the uhlenhorst ferry-house, with a good drink before him and the sound of music in his ears, while he watched the lighted boats, and the swans mirrored in the bright water
no, of course, it was out of the question

often, in an hour of depression, thomas buddenbrouk asked himself what he was, or what there was about him to make him think even a little better of himself than he did of his honest, limited, provincial fellow-burghers

but it isn’t a humanistic gesture, speaking latin in honour of death; and the latin isn’t what you learn at school, either—the spirit of it is quite different, one might almost say hostile
the little company in meng street, not committed, as we have seen, to large entertainments, had the more leisure for intimacy with each other
settembrini was silent a few paces
what he wants and gives is triumph over it, is shining, sparkling, vainglori- ous unreflectiveness!

his excellent chair, with the sectional mattress and the neck-roll, he pulled close to the snow-cushioned balustrade; at his hand was the white table with the lighted readinglamp, a stack of books, and a glass of creamy milk, the evening milk which was brought to each of the guests’ rooms at nine o’clock

then the judglllent upon this very biron: you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick, and still converse with groaning wretches; and his cry: it cannot be: mirth cannot move a soul in agony!

it was the difference of the life-curve between good, yes, excellent average, which was destined to return from that roving, seeking student life to its bourgeois courses, and the other, invisi- bly singled out, who would never forsake the hard route of the mind, would tread it, who knew whither, and whose gaze, whose attitude, never quite resolved in the fraternal, whose inhibitions in his personal relations made me and probably others aware that he himself divined this difference

ellen brand rested her finger lightly on the glass and directed her pure, childlike gaze away into the rosy light from the table-lamp
the former, indeed, all the while protested that he was just a plain man, and this high-flown stuff utterly beyond him, his experience with the pleura-shock having been the sole event in his life to raise it above the most humdrum sphere

the next moment little johann sat upright in bed, stammering incomprehensibly, and staring wilh wide-open, strange golden-brown eyes into a world which he, and he alone, could see

hans castorp being taken by another fit of laughing, his cousin laughed too, with hearty enjoyment, and told other funny things to add fuel to their merriment
i have always objected to the perpetual occupation of young heads with greek and latin
a week later there sat in senator buddenbrook's private office, in the leather chair beside the writing-desk, a little smooth-shaven old man with snow-white hair falling over his brow and temples
he had a habit of slowly and cautiously stroking the red-brown moustache that grew over his mouth with the extended middle and index fingers of his left hand; or he would rub his hands together and let his round brown eyes wander so aimlessly about that he gave the impression of complete confusion and absent-mindedness, though he was always must watchfully bent on the matter in hand

he fairly pushed himself away from it
that is what we recognized betimes and why from early on we had an eye on you - we saw that your case was quite definitely worth the trouble, that it was a case of the most fa- vourable situation, whereof with only a little of our fire lighted under it, only a little heating, elation, intoxication, something brilliant could be brought out did not bismarck say something about the germans needing half a bottle of champagne to arrive at their normal height?

and i have to stagnate up here—yes, just stagnate like a filthy puddle; it isn’t too crass a comparison

after that you just keep on saying  amadame': 'ah, madame,  madame, que pensez-vous, madame; on me dit, madame, que vous ctes fana- tique de musique?
well, anyhow, hans castorp considered, so much was granted: that in the antithesis between body and soul it was undoubtedly the body which embodied—the body embodied, that wasn’t so bad, was it?—the evil principle; in so far as the body was naturally nature—pretty good, too, that!—and nature, being diametrically opposed to the spirit and reason, was by that fact intrinsically evil—mystically evil, one might say, if it didn’t sound like showing off!
and so this, said he, after he had greeted the young girl and exclaimed over her likeness to her mother, is the new member of the family?
surely, i answered him, you wo not defend such a ridiculous and dogmatic arrangement, such childish rationalism as this in- vention of masters and servants
for these good gifts he praised germany; praised her for her past, but awarded his own country the palm, because she had been the first to unfurl the banner of freedom, culture, and enlightenment, at a time when all other lands were wrapped in the darkness of superstition and slavery
with him it had grovvn to be something like a state of mind, in which past and future merged together; the cool gaze he directed upon the hypertrophy of the post-romantic monster orchestra, the need he felt for its reduction and return to the an- cillary role that it had played at the time of the preharmonic, the polyphonic vocal music; his tendency in this direction and thus to oratorio, a species in which the creator of the revellltion of st john and the lajlentcltion of dr faustus would later achieve his highest and boldest flights - all this came out very early in
and, as ever, hans castorp was filled by emotion at the sound, an emotion which this time circumstances magnified and as it were condensed into a longing; he thought: barren and sinful or no, it would be a marvellous thing, a darling adventure!
all the good fellows, among them dr gieseke and peter dbhlmann, took leave of him at the station, and brought him flowers and cigars, and laughed to split their sides--recalling, no doubt, all the stories christian had told them

if you said that illness is sometimes a consequence of depravity, that would at least be sensible
for this hellish laughter at the end of the first part has its pend- ant in the truly extraordinary chorus of children which, accom- panied by a chamber orchestra, opens the second part: a piece of cosmic music of the spheres, icily clear, glassily transparent, of brittle dissonances indeed, but withal of an - i would like to say - inaccessibly unearthly and alien beauty of sound, filling the heart with longing without hope
we shudder as we realize that a connection subsists between it and the nether world, and that the reassuring epitheta which i sought to apply: sane, noble, harmonious, hu- mane, do not for that reason quite fit, even when - i force my- self, however painfully, to make this distinction - even when they are applied to a pure and genuine, god-given, or shall i say god- inflicted genius, and not to an acquired kind, the sinful and mor- bid corruption of natural gifts, the issue of a horrible bargain
it is the angel of the in- dividual, the genius of his life, in whose all-knowing guidance it gladly confides
pity you aren’t a member, you could get me in as a guest, as—as associate half-lunger—you ought to ask behrens to put you out of commission, then perhaps you could learn to whistle too; it must be something one could learn—well, that’s the funniest thing ever i heard in my life!
laugh, dream, and feel amazement, when the world yet makes upon us not one single demand; when the impatience of those whom we should like so much to love does not yet torment us for evidence of our ability to succeed in the impending strug-gle

it was not particularly ladylike, this hand that was putting the braids to rights; not so refined and well kept as the hands of ladies in hans castorp’s own social sphere
talking about post-mortems already
hans castorp’s charitable impulse was stronger than his cousin’s distaste; which the latter, moreover, could only manifest by silence and averted eyes, since he could not stand for it except by betraying a lack of christian feeling

tony and her mother did hear from him, in the course of conversation, what dishonourable means gr� had used to get hold of the eighty thousand marks; but the consul was careful to give the matter no pub-licity

the family dining-room and the much larger kitchen, in vhich friends from the village were entertained, lay in the upper storey

he was all the time saying how clever and resourceful he was, and all the time hiding his villainy

but herr naphta preferred to discredit art sooner than admit that it might have a humanizing effect upon a sunken wretch

the gay old lady continued to talk in her semifluid tongue at the care-worn dr blumenkohl, diagonally opposite; her lean niece actually at last ate something else than yogurt; namely, the thick cream of barley soup, which was handed round in soup-plates by the waitresses
it’s old, of course?
after joachim’s cavalier treatment of madame chauchat—in which hans castorp seemed to savour something almost like faint hostility on his cousin’s part toward their fair fellow-patient, a hostility at which he could not help smiling, despite the commotion in his mind—clavdia tried a turn up and down the room

they bring you your midday broth, as they brought it yesterday and will bring it to-morrow; and it comes over you—but whence or how you do not know, it makes you quite giddy to see the broth coming in—that you are losing a sense of the demarcation of time, that its units are running together, disappearing; and what is being revealed to you as the true content of time is merely a dimensionless present in which they eternally bring you the broth
it would never occur to anyone to call you that
listen, my dear child, said the consul, stroking her hair
it was in the light of what he had said, he went on, that the work he was speaking of in particular, sonata ope i i i, was to be regarded
he wished, he said, not to offend either side
my cousin and i have had the privilege of frequent conversations with him on this and kindred subjects—what it amounted to, of course, was that we listened while he explained and developed his views—so i can vouch for the fact, and my cousin here will confirm me, that herr settembrini spoke more than once, with great enthusiasm, of the revolutionary principle, and about rebellion and reform—which is no very peaceful principle, i should think—and of the mighty efforts still to be made before it triumphs everywhere, and the great universal worldrepublic can come into being

in fact, from his grandson’s narrative, the two hearers got a picture of a dark and tempest-tossed figure, a ringleader, political agitator, and conspirator; despite all their pains, they did not quite succeed in hiding a feeling of mistrust, even repulsion
in the dusk of that slow-brightening dawn, moved by such mingled and fluctuating hopes and feelings, he mounted the narrow path along the slope, from the village end of the bob-run; arrived at the deeply drifted woods, crossed the little wooden bridge over the course, and followed a way among the tree-trunks trodden by feet in the snow rather than cleared by any shovel

it is sad enough that when i followed the dictates of my heart and married against your wishes, and further wounded your insensate pride by taking over a shop, you should have repulsed me so cruelly and remorselessly; but the way in which you now treat me cries out to heaven, and you are utterly mistaken if you imagine that i intend to accept your silence without a struggle

the coming sunday, as he remarked to himself and to his cousin, would see the performance of another of the fortnightly concerts, and the monday another lecture by dr krokowski; then, on tuesday or wednesday, he would be off, and joachim would be left up here alone—poor joachim, for whom rhadamanthus would prescribe god knew how many more months!

tbe brass does not start from the beginning as it did the first time, but as though its melody had already been tere for a while; and it continues, solemnly, to that climax from which it wisely refrained the first time, in order that the surging feeling, the ah-h-effect, might be the greater: novv it gloriously bestrides its theme, mounting unchecked, with weighty support from the passing notes on the tuba, and then, looking back, as it were, with dignified satisfaction on the finished achievement, sings itself dec- orously to the end

it might be true and it might not; but was he, thomas buddenbrook, called upon to express such ideas--was he called upon even to think them?
she was silent, and looked neither id the right nor to the left
with pribislav’s very eyes she had looked at him, and at the spots of blood on his coat; her look had been rather bold and ruthless too, as a woman’s would be who let doors bang behind her

at the same time polyphony predominates in the extreme, and every part is quite independent at every moment
the shouts that greeted him when, i amust almost say on rare occasions: he appeared at a session in the smoke- filled private room in mtitze's tavern, did contain a little fun at the expense of his supposed misanthropy; but they expressed genuine pleasure as well

when she and the consul were alone, in the room lighted by burned-down candles, with the furniture disarranged and the air thick with heavy odours of rich food, wine, cigars, coffee, perfume, and the scent of the flowers from the ladies' toilettes and the table decorations, he pressed her hand and said: very good, gerda

the man was an resthete unnerved by erotic excesses and in a religious sense a progressivist blockhead, typical of the back-formation of the cult of the effectively present national god, the general concept of the metaphysical power of the folk, into the preaching of an abstract and generally human god in heaven; in other words, from the religion of the people to the religion of the world

superfluous to account for herr peeperkorn
he rots away, liver, kidneys, stomach, heart, bowels; some day his voice will be a croak, or he will be deaf, after a few years he will ingloriously shuffle off this coyle, with a cynical quip on his lips - what then?

for all interest in disease and death is only another expression of interest in life, as is proven by the humanistic faculty of medicine, that addresses life and its ails always so politely in latin, and is only a division of the great and pressing concern which, in all sympathy, i now name by its name: the human being, the delicate child of life, man, his state and standing in the universe

the sky-line was high, the distance seemed to mount to hans castorp’s view, looking down as he did from his elevation onto the spreading gulf beneath

after tony had expressed many times her conviction that she should soon be back again on a visit, and that they too would not delay long to come to hamburg to see her, she climbed in good spirits into the coach and let herself be care-fully wrapped up by the consul in the warm fur rug

at the right, in front, was a time-regulating device, with a dial and figures like a watch; at the left, the lever, which set the mechanism going or stopped it; and behind, also on the left, the hollow, curving, club-shaped, nickel-plated arm, with its flexible joints, carrying the flat round sound-box at the end, with a fitment into which the needle was screwed
frau schweigestill, worn with lack of sleep, her eyes swollen with weeping, met me at the door and urged me to go at once to adrian

these aging spinsters felt that all too little shadow set off the sunshine through which thomas's outward life ran its brilliant course

the old inhabitants passed it by without thought; and—though in general they seized on every pretext for jollification, and took occasion to celebrate their own private anniversaries in addition to these that accented the recurrent rhythm of the year; making merry with popping of corks in the restaurant, over birthdays, general examinations, imminent departures whether wild or sanctioned, and the like—they accorded to the anniversary of arrival no other attention than that of a profound silence

it even came to this: that the thought of lawyer einhuf could not enter his mind without calling up there, by an association of ideas, the thought of fränzchen oberdank, the little creature with the sleek blond head, whose mamma, a worthy dame from the provinces, had brought her up to the berghof a few weeks before
every family has its own skeleton, he went on in a lower voice, with a glance at jock's broad back
when the shattered wood steams (a povverful passage); the so new and enlightened concord of the high register of the organ with the strings at the end, when the deity comes, no longer in storm, but in hushed murmurings and beneath it arches the bow of peace; yet despite all these i have never understood the work in its real spiritual sense, its inward necessity, its purpose, informed by fear, of seeking grace in praise

they went out on the high-road to the next village, or along the beach to the ocean temple on its height, whence a wide view was to be had over land and sea; or to the woods be-hind the kurhouse, where was a great bell used to call the guests to the table-d'hote

well, when you say amateur (hans castorp could not recall saying anything of the sort), the word is perhaps not ill chosen; it has a slight suggestion of superficiality—yes, very well, i am an amateur of music—which is not to say that i set great store by it; not as i love and reverence the word, the bearer of the spirit, the tool and gleaming ploughshare of progress—music?

lead back my mind to what you said previously about vice: that it consists in an affront to the simple, what you call the holy, or, as i might say, the classic, gifts which life offers us; the larger gifts, by contrast with the later and cultivated’ ones, the refinements, which you indulge in,  as one of us put it, whereas one consecrates oneself’ to the great gifts and pays them homage
one can only add that had there been no pieter peeperkorn, party feeling would have run higher on both sides; as when leo naphta defended the arch-revolutionary nature of the church, against settembrini’s dogmatic assertion that that great historic power was to be looked upon merely as the protectress of the sinister forces of reaction; whereas all the forces that made for life and future, and looked undismayed on change and resolution, he claimed for the principles of enlightenment; science and progress, which had their rise in an epoch of quite opposed tendencies, the famous century that witnessed the rebirth of classical culture

herr settembrini, of course, could not refrain from protesting against this hideous conception of policy; against the gesture of a shrewd and sinister complaisance, made by the spirit—or what called itself so—against the imaginary guilt of its opposite, which it pretended to deal with in a politic sense, but which in reality stood in no need of the pernicious indulgence it proffered; against the accursed dualism of a conception which bedevilled the universe—that is to say, life—as well as life’s dark opposite, the spirit—for if life was evil, the spirit, as pure negation, must be so too
hans castorp well remembered the mottled pallor of joachim’s skin when, for the first and only time, he had innocently alluded to marusja’s physical charms in the light tone he might have assumed at home

a fresh rumour from the town hall, running zig-zag through the crowd, has reached her ears
that is to say—i suppose i am expressing myself very ridiculously, but—you can see how the things of the mind and the love of beauty come together, and that they always really have been one and the same—in other words, science and art; and that the calling of being an artist surely belongs with the others, as a sort of fifth faculty, because it too is a humanistic calling, a variety of humanistic interest, in so far as its most important theme or concern is with man—you will agree with me on that point

they were, to a man, well-meaning and sweet-humoured; and they were one in the belief that knowledge and good cheer are not mutually exclusive
in other words, between death and us there is no rapport; it is something with which we have nothing to do—and only incidentally the world and nature

the slender, elderly legs were cased in black silk stockings; the shoes had silver buckles

only that the dialectic process - by which, at the stage of development that this work occupies, is consummated by the change from the strictest constraint to the free language of feeling, the birth of freedom from bondage - the dialectic process appears as end- lessly more complicated in its logic, endlessly more miraculous and amazing than at the time of the madrigalists

they had talked at length and repeatedly with him, on the subject of his resolve; also about how he could carry on the service of the cure even after he left the berghof; about his taking with him and continuing the great encyclopædic task he had set himself, that survey of the masterpieces of belles-lettres, from the point of view of human suffering and its elimination; finally, about herr settembrini’s future lodging, in the house of a petty chandler, as the italian called him

she appears unannounced on the scene, some three heads taller than i am, white-haired and exceeding wroth; fetches herr anton a couple of boxes on the ear, takes him by the collar, and puts him on the train
but, after all, it was not so absolutely cer-tain, beyond a peradventure--there were exceptions to every rule
the old man's rosy face grew sterner as he opened the seal with one finger, unfolded the thin paper, and gave it a smart rap with the back of his hand as he turned about to catch the light from the candles
they were students from the conservatoires, painters, writers, young publishers, also beginning lawyers with an interest in the arts, a fcw actors, members of the leipzig kam- merspiele, under strong literary influence - and so on
all this bespoke and beknown, will i now to take leave to play you a little out of the construction which i heard from the lovely instrument of satan and which in part the knowing children sang to me
to the pedagogic temperament there is something revolting about that
she sobbed once or twice before she answered, hopelessly: oh, no, tom
i ca not tell you how pleased i am that they are installing gas for the street-lighting, and the miser-able old oil-lamps are disappearing--i admit i had a little something to do with that change
thus what we call tedium is rather an abnormal shortening of the time consequent upon monotony
you do understand me - you could scarcely mistake
fränzchen’s case, on her arrival, and even after the examination, had been thought a light one
i howled like a rhained-up dog; i felt dread-fully
we who were present at the explanation had indeed an uncommonly enriching evening, and this although the sonata un- der discussion was to that date entirely unknown to us
it is all perfectly new and astonishing to me—i am free to confess
hans castorp walked into his own room in confusion
i prefer to annihilate my consciousness at its very centre by introducing my charming little foreign body direct into this interesting organ—herr albin indicated with his index finger a spot on his close-cropped blond pate
the tea-kettle was humming
she knew that clavdia chauchat was having her portrait painted, and asked hans castorp if he knew it too
it is not quite the thing, is it?
that’s nothing but a week-end!—won’t pay you to take off your hat
three weeks up here was as good as nothing at all; they had all told him so in the beginning
the health of the dear patient, as well as of the infant, is unexception-able
the discussion was intermitted only by a visit to the church; it was in the main a controversy between rudi schwerdtfeger and me over the so- called madness, the incapacity for reigning, the dethronement and legal restraint of ludwig
it was like a dry cough, which had of late become almost a habit with her, and had probably to do with her digestive trouble
after the examination he confirmed the disposi- tions of his obsequious rural colleague: avoidance of light, head kept cool and bedded high, very gentle handling, alcohol rubs, concentrated nourishment; it would probably become necessary to give it by a tube through the nose
who would have thought it of him?
after the third time, however, the frau senator refrained from reply
but it is obvious that you are even more interested in him than in her
i ,yell know this is at bottom what they mean 'who apply the ,vord barbaric to adrian's creation
the invasion of france, long recognized as a pos- sibility, has come, a technical and military feat of the first, or rather of an altogether unique order, prepared with the fullest de- liberation, in which we could the less prevent the enemy since we did not dare concentrate our defence at the single point of land- ing, being uncertain whether or not to regard it as one among many further attacks at points we could not guess
all about him was coldness - and how do i feel, using this word, which he himself, in an uncanny connection, once also set down?
and he, as i said, responded with a ,vorsening of his impediment amounting a few times almost to a calamity
and joachim, with a quick look at his cousin, answered, drawing his heels together as he sat: for half past three
after forty years in the service of the buddenbrook family, left it to return to her native west prussia to live out the evening of her life

oftener there vvas no occasion at all, it was the purest silliness, and i confess that i al- ways had certain difficulties in seconding him
she carried in one hand her little lacquered key-basket; the other was in the pocket of her gown, whose soft folds played about her
yes, just now, as we came out
the whole affair, each time, took but a second; one after another, the row of patients received their dosage, in thigh or arm, and turned away
take care, if it drips on your skin it will blister
the senator followed on the invitation
on using his handkerchief he discovered it to be red with blood, but had not enough energy to think about the fact, though he was rather given to worrying over himself and by nature inclined to hypochondria
hans castorp said—and he too addressed his companion with the licence of the season, and said thou to him: dear me, you’re full of poetry to-night
are not we well enough as we are?
ah, it was worth dying for, the enchanted lied!
even so, the present enclosure seemed fairly full, both along the wall and in the less desirable inner plots; one could hardly see or say just where another interment was to take place
it seemed he simply could not lay eyes on the hofrat; either that evening, or in the course of the two following days
ich trage meine minne

he took his skis and went up on the funicular to the schatzalp; there, rapt six thousand feet above the sea, he revelled at will on the gleaming slopes of powdery snow—whence, in good weather, there was a view of majestic extent over all the surrounding territory
he said himself that he had the pedagogic itch
i’ll stick a little something in my pocket for second breakfast; then i shall be independent
she had folded her arms again
you must see kretschmar soon, it occurred to him to say \
the red spots on breast and ab-domen are more numerous
she set a steaming cup of cocoa before him, and pushed the bread and butter, salt, and an egg-cup toward his place
her manner expressed sheer surprise and umbrage - and that both startled and secretly pleased him
peeperkorn made no objection to his neighbours’ enjoyment, but did not smoke himself—he never had done so
good gracious, what a business!
his name, so the young people understood, was naphta
he had the same rather small round deep-set eyes and the same prominent aquiline nose; the lines of his face below the cheek-bones showed that it would not always retain its present child-like fulness
is there anything more heartfelt, more glorious, he would cry, than such a pro- gression of mere triads?
hans castorp reflected that if that were true, then what about the anonymous and communal—not to mention any other contradiction?
he looked toward the open balcony door, and considered seeking counsel of joachim, but thought better of it and paused again by the table
but she had seen the child's smile, the rhythm of his body, the beloved little head swaying enraptured from side to side--and the sight had penetrated to the depths of her easily moved nature
on a june afternoon, not long after five o'clock, the family were sitting before the portal in the garden, where they had drunk coffee
no more did his body lie supine while his ego roved back to a far-off present
the fresh milk, and the farm sausages and hams--one thrives like the cattle and the crops
it seemed to him that with his two simple inquiries he had refuted settembrini’s whole position, even the republic and the bello stile
edgar, said dr mantelsack, closing his note-book with his finger in it
even so, it did not come about without angry opposition, bitter reproaches and outcries against the piece as a mockery of art, an expression of nihilism, a crime against music, in short, to use the current and fashionable condemnation, as a specimen of cultural bolshevism
but doubtless—am i then to ascribe it to the—what was it you said?—the pedagogic principles of signor settembrini that you—i beg you not to misunderstand me— not at all, mynheer peeperkorn
joachim was for instructing his cousin in the names of the mist-wreathed alpine heights which seemed to enclose the valley on the south, pointing them out in turn with his alpenstock
he had been coughing a bit down below, but otherwise quite lively
art would like to stop being pretence and play, it would like to become knowledge
he addressed his relative as young man, and asked if he was crazy
he will undoubtedly come up to ascertain your condition
but when he heard his neighbours to right and left conclude their evening cure and re-enter their rooms to exchange the horizontal without for the horizontal within, he gave utterance to the conviction that at least this evening the barbaric pair would keep the peace
only a short hour now remained before school would begin
it was the re-turn from an unspeakably painful wandering, the correction of a grave mistake, the loosening of chains, the opening of doors--it put right again a lamentable mischance
let us see, now--let us see--what sort of offer was it they had made?
and dr krokowski entered it all in his book, just like the tailor’s assistant
furthermore, joachim was always urging an early withdrawal
in the corridor joachim pointed to this and that door and gave the names of the occupants—there were german names, but also all sorts of foreign ones—with brief comments on them and the seriousness of their cases
it would have been better to keep still and get a mark
if one had to sit up here for ever and a day—!
would you like to dance?
then it appeared that herr kistenmaker was not minded to allow any interference in what he considered his prerogative
so when echo addressed his uncle for the first time, his words, instead of sounding forward, seelned to be placating and making light of something, loyally reducing it to simple and friendly terms: well, you are glad i did come, yes?
you can expect from me nothing that runs counter to the duties i have to-day assumed; all other feelings must be silent
so much the better if that is true
let me do it, he said to them, gently putting them aside; and they gave way, first because he wore an air of having known all about it for years, and second because they cared little to take their pleasures actively, instead of sitting to be served to as much and such enjoyment as they could comfortably and unbored receive
but it was perfectly plain that either he or her mother had let the pastor into the secret
in the details of his physical appearance--the rhin, the nose, and especially the hands, which were wonderfully true to the buddenbrook type--his likeness to his grandfather was more pronounced than ever
and the senator determined not to let any such opportunities pass without improving them
for the visitor’s first motion, while still on the threshold, had been to turn on the electric light, which filled the room in a trice with vibrating brilliance, and reverberated from the gleaming white ceiling and furniture
but the 'senator' and this house are superficial after all
what does  wouldead' mean when the drop displays such a healthy appetite?
i call it that, because in my opinion the unhappiness of the world rests on the disunity of the intellect, the stupidity, the lack of comprehension, which separates its spheres fron each other
so this was young joachim’s home-coming—for a little after-cure
he has consecrated his burgher’s pike on the altar of humanity, so that salami may be taxed at the brenner frontier
which in my view was an inven- tion of tante's
you lie there on your chips and sawdust, and you bloat; the gases swell you up, puff you all out, the way frogs do when bad little boys fill them up with air
they laughed, glad that he should be pleased to jest and talk poetry
the anthers shook out their yellow pollen on the thalamus from the tips of their filaments, the pitted pistil stood stiffly up from the ovaries; when hans castorp cut through it longitudinally, he could see the narrow channel through which the pollen grains and utricles were floated by the nectar secretion into the ovarian cavity
thus ended the continuation of p:drian's cure by dr zimbalist, after its earlier interruption

halle was, if not a metropolis, at least a large city, with more than two hundred thousand inhabitants
moreover it is pure hypochondria
no, just as it was, it accurately mirrored his inner state, and that, whatever its simplicity, was full of troubled, involved, dubious, not quite ingenuous thoughts
you are not fond of children, antonie
it must keep together
the softness of his outward seeming, however, contrasted strongly with the actual strength and self-respect of his charac- ter
he made a droll picture of a grief-stricken widower on his daily pilgrimage to the graveside, to hold communion with the beloved departed; and said that the man must have a superfluity of that most precious of human commodities, time; and further, that the rush of business in a large modern burying-ground must surely dash his atavistic bliss

he sat down, as if all were in the best of order
i can still see the figures of some of them; for instance, that of thomas, the ostler, who used to fetch us from weissenfels and bring us back: a one-eyed, ex- traordinarily long and bony man, with a slight hump, on which he used to let little adrian ride; it was, the meister often told me later, a most practical and comfortable seat
jonathan leverkiihn was a man of the best german type, such as one seldom sees now in our towns and cities, certainly not among those who today, often with blatant exaggeration, repre- sent our german manhood
you will, herr settembrini persisted, level this reproach in vain, if humanistic pride one day learns to feel as a debasement and disgrace the fact that the intellect is bound up with the body and with nature
he might as well have said against whom, but expressed himself impersonally to show how completely unconscious he was of herr settembrini’s meaning—a meaning which even joachim perfectly comprehended
you never asked me to wait, i did it on my own
i wouldn’t contradict you, herr settembrini, because you look at the question from a higher point of view, so to speak, as an author
yes, this wipes out a lot of things--not least the affair with that person whose name i do not even like to speak

herr permaneder f orebore to commit himself on the subject of his departure
he had driven hither in his carriage
yes, the good, the patient, the upright joachim, so affected to discipline and the service, had been attacked by fits of rebellion, he even questioned the authority of the gaffky scale: the method employed in the laboratory—the lab, as one called it—to ascertain the degree of a patient’s infection
he tried to say very well, but his voice was inaudible in the clamour behind him

producer at once and urgently claimed our sympathy
the date cannot be fixed, but it must certainly have been in our early school-days that he ceased to bestow it on me and used only my last name instead, though it would have seemed to me impossibly harsh to do the same
whether settembrini had remarked yes, yes, or i see, i see, or both, or merely poveretto!
that was all he did; the rest the drop did itself
her brother himself sits there, certainly a little pale
hans castorp betook himself to his balcony, his ears full of the hurly-burly and the clashing of arms, as the army of jerusalem and that of babylon, under the dos banderas, came on in battle array, and met each other midst tumult and shoutings
the consul said: no, let me do it, gosch
still, i may be allowed to indicate the tragic antino- mies of which life is full
it must come up, and he must answer; but was her brother now in a mood to be governed by gentleness and filial piety?
times are not what they were when your grandfather was a prussian army contractor
hans castorp felt utterly dumbfounded—involuntarily he slapped the table with his hand
he crossed the stream and the narrow-gauge road to the street, with its scattered buildings; but left this again soon to strike into a meadow path, which went only a short way on the level and then slanted steeply up to the right
literally that, and making just such a face; i have often heard them, and i see now it made an impression on me—which it would not have done, of course, unless it had struck me as strange
they shook their fingers at him, they winked maliciously, they put their heads on one side, crooked their forefingers beside their ears and waggled them in a pantomime suggestive of their delight at having found him out, who had played the innocent so long
it was so obnox-ious, so incredibly tactless, that i can find no words--the stupidity called down a sharp snub on you at once

gerda had finished her hair for the night and was brushing  her big white teeth, using the ivory-backed hand-mirror to see them better
in the morning the bathing-master would give a mighty thump on the door and enter—a nervous individual named turnherr, who wore his sleeves rolled up, and had great standing veins upon his forearms, and a gurgling, impeded speech
what is it you reproach him with?
it was not easy to understand her rage and terror; hans castorp did not see at once what she meant, and inquired: well?
passionate—that means to live for the sake of living
he felt all the world looking at him expectantly, questioning if he would know how to command prestige for the firm and the family and protect its name
he tested hanno's heart action and measured his chest and his lamentable muscular development

beethoven, then, so we heard, was reputed not to be able to write a fugue; and now the question was how far this malicious criticism was true
on the sixth occasion, when he felt, he divined, an inner voice whispered him, that she was looking, he pretended to be absorbed in disgusted contemplation of a pimply dame who had stopped to talk with the great-aunt

i did not care for it when kammersanger kioeielund brayed out sieg- fried's pretty dull and long-winded smith's songs so that all the vases and glass-ware in the salon rattled and rang in sympathy
i regret to say it escaped my attention, joachim said grumpily
on their side, the jewish publishers' wives and bankers' ladies looked up to him with the profound admiration of their race for german master- blood and long legs and greatly enjoyed making him presents: the knitted stockings, belts, sweaters, and scarves which he wore were mostly gifts, and not always quite unprompted
the arch of the loggia framed a glorious panorama of snow-powdered forest, softly filled passes and ravines, white, sunlit valleys, and radiant blue heavens above all
hans castorp might have applied to him with his metaphysical puzzles, if only by way of challenge or in a carping spirit, without any serious expectation of an answer from the humanist, whose concerns and interests, of course, were all of this earth
actually, he only told him what the artistic sense of the pupil might have said itsejf, or what it had already told him
never mind, my child; things will all be arranged here, just take what is necessary in a small trunk

more than once he remonstrated angrily, this constant harping on musical \dlues, my dear, strikes me as rather tasteless and opinionated
he lifted his head and tried to say something; but bubbles of blood welled out between his lips, whose gentle fullness seemed all at once so touching to me; his eyes rolled and his head fell back with a thud on the bench

true above all for the embittered self-castigation of the heart be- cause of its infatuation with the whitely wanton with a velvet brow, with two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes, and again quite particularly for the musical picture of these beloved ac- cursed eyes: a melisma darkly flashing out of the sound of coffi-

it was somewhat past the half-hour when the door was opened by the technical assistant to admit the swedish giant and fortune’s minion
as you see, sir
they drove under a heaven thick with stars, and hans castorp, his head tipped back, with pointing forefinger expounded to his uncle-cousin the starry field, named planets by name and showed off this or that constellation
herr permaneder had to explain to frau antonie in her turn the reason of his appearance
because they were revolting
with unerring instinct he divined that this figure was cal- culated to add content to his unsatisfied existence, and he made himself the slave of one who had scarcely ever heard his name

his grandfather had enjoyed playing the flute, and he himself always listened with pleasure to melodies that possessed a graceful charm, a lively swing, or a lender melancholy

he preserved a depressed and brooding silence
ah,  thought i, there lies our charming invalid, obeying the rules of the house, for the sake of an early return to the arms of her waiting husband
and there were still nlhrr days, dreamy, blue, wind- less, broodingly warm, when the blue flies buzzed in the sun above the leuchtenfield, and the sea lay silrni and like a mirror, without sir or breath
and if we touched upon the further question, whether our readers were clear how much time had passed since the upright joachim, deceased in the interval, had introduced into the conversation the above-quoted phrases about music and time—remarks indicating a certain alchemistical heightening of his nature, which, in its goodness and simplicity, was, of its own unaided power, incapable of any such ideas—we should not have been dismayed to hear that they were not clear
his wife thought this very elegant, but also very disgusting--she had never brought herself to take it instead of her usual breakfast of bread and butter and an egg- tony was in her dressing-gown

herr albin asked, almost gruffly, and emphasized his energetic speech by shaking his head
their movements were quick, agile, and noiseless; hardly had any one time to be sensible of the pain of the situation, before they had lifted the burden from the bier to their shoulders, and the flower-covered casket swayed away smoothly and with decorum through the pillared hall

outside was the reeking void, the world enwrapped in greywhite cotton-wool, packed to the window-panes in snow and mist
her mother, frau permaneder, saw further
he wrenched his eyes open, amazed at the depths of the trance in which he had been sunk
a peculiarity of this given name was that you were to pronounce it as though it were spelled pschibislav; and the singularity of the appellation suited the lad’s appearance, which did indeed have something exotic about it
or, rather, it followed directly from the union, the unity that subsisted between humanity and literature, for the beautiful word begets the beautiful deed
the entrance was through a narrow whitewashed corridor opening into the restaurant on the right side, where it smelled of beer and cooking, and thence through a handleless, lockless green door so small and narrow that no one could have supposed such a large room lay behind it
thomas used to make cool sarcastic comments and act as if he thought christian was exaggerating or hoaxing--which was certainly not the case
i ask, are they problems?
and you will see, you will succeed with him
they were quite ready, and took temporary leave of frau permaneder, expressing the hope of seeing her again when they had finished
flushed with pleasure and industry, she ran impetuously down the steps; gerda and thomas climbed out of the trunk-laden carriage wrapped in their furs; and she drew them into the house in her embrace

beneath each dried specimen in his herbarium he carefully inscribed in ornamental lettering the latin name which a humanistic science had gallantly bestowed on it; added its distinguishing characteristics, and submitted the whole to the approval of the good joachim, who was all admiration

he had been taken to the opera as compensation lor a particularly painful visit to herr brncht; sitting beside his mother, in the dress circle, he had followed breathless a per-formance of fidelia, and since that time he had heard nothing, seen nothing, thought of nothing but opera, and a passion for the theatre filled him and almost kept him sleep-less
he contemplated this fact with pleasure; he enjoyed the reflection that his relation to the femur, or to organic nature generally was now threefold: it was lyrical, it was medical, it was technological; and all of these, he felt, were one in being human, they were variations of one and the same pressing human concern, they were schools of humanistic thought

he talked about the pleasure of driving, the charm of sitting still and being moved along at the same time amid a changing scene; showed a fatherly interest in hans castorp, even patted the forlorn wehsal’s cheek and bade him forget his own unsympathetic ego in admiration of the blithe exterior world, to which the italian pointed with a spacious gesture of his hand in its worn leather glove
he began to smoke—it was wonderful, as behrens had said

hans castorp would be good enough to go by himself—let him pay his cousin ziemssen a visit
she did not live deeply, it is true, into the life or affairs of her new home; but she breathed the munich air, the air of a great city, full of artists and citizens who habitually did nothing: an air with something about it a little demoralizing, which she sometimes found it hard to take good-humouredly

the phenomenon so freshly called up to him the memory of his dead grandfather that, far from finding it offensive, he took a certain pleasure in availing himself of that remembered and dignified method of supporting the chin, by means of which his grandfather had been wont to control the shaking of his head, and to which the boy had responded with such inward sympathy

their spirits, particularly the sallow frau magnus’s, were proof against any ray of cheer; forlornity exhaled from her like damp from a cellar; even more than frau stöhr she represented that unedifying union of dullness and disease, which had offended hans castorp’s soul—under correction from herr settembrini
the cousins were sitting on a bench at the end of the garden, in front of a semicircle of young firs
but the senator sat apparently at ease

the mythological fantasy made me think of the sting or shot-wound of the chrys

for the moment we need only recall the swift flight of time—even of a quite considerable period of time—which we spend in bed when we are ill all the days are nothing but the same day repeating itself—or rather, since it is always the same day, it is incorrect to speak of repetition; a continuous present, an identity, an everlastingness—such words as these would better convey the idea
you must show what you are made of, herr dieckmann, added the consul
a dinner is so soothing
you know, there is now and then one among them who does not treat the merchant classes with any great respect, though perfectly aware that he ca not do without them
in kitchen and cellar every-thing was tip-top, and he himself was considered a most courteous and tactful host, whose toasts were wittier than the common run
the father of all human beings, who had sent a part of himsplf npnn earlh to suffer and bleed for our sins, and who, on ihe final day, would come to judge the quick and the dead; at whose feet the justified, in the course of the eternity then beginning, would br recompensed for the sorrows they had borne in mis vale of tears, yes, he strove'to subscribe to the whole confused unconvincing story, which required no intelligence, only obedient credulity; and which, when the last anguish came, would sustain one in a firm and child-like faith--� but would it, really?
surely he knew the answer to his question; as surely it could not be put in words
hans castorp would think of him when, before very long, it came to an upset in that country
both sisters had confidence in ne; that is, they seemed to consider ine capable of just evaluations of others, a capacity, of course, which, if it is to inspire full confidence, must stand outside any situation and view it with unclouded eye
hans castorp asked, inclining his head in answer
the principal warks af thomas mann
thus for the third time in so short a space and in such young years did death play upon the spirit and senses—but chiefly on the senses—of the lad
he half lay, half sat, on the chaise-longue, tying and untying his sailor's knot, and his eyes, raving aimlessly about, caught sight of an open portfolio on his mother's nut-wood writing-table
if hans castorp wanted to do himself a good turn before he entered his post at tunder and wilms’s, what more natural than that he should go up to davos and keep his poor cousin company for a while—it would be agreeable on both sides
then the mistress of the house and her guest sat alone in the family living- roon
no little reading was done, in the rest-halls and private loggias of the international sanatorium berghof; largely, however, by the new-comers and short-timers, for the patients of many months’ or years’ standing had long learned to kill time without mental effort or means of distraction, by dint of a certain inner virtuosity they came to possess
we must proceed to extraction, fraulein, he would say, growing pale
and a man-servant would be so useful for errands and so on
the senator gave away the bride, supported by christian's friend senator cieseke, and two school friends of erica's acted as bridesmaids
whoever is in that state cannot wish not to be, it would be like wishing not to live, because it has bound itself up with life
quite exactly, no metaphors
i shall be forgiven for an argument more or less into the blue; but to call soullessness the yearning for a soul- the yearning of the little sea-maid - that is what i would characterize as barbarism, as inhumanity!
it was tante isabeau whom ru- dolf met when he entered the little vestibule of the pension
the consul took her hand, bowed to his son-in-law, and moved with her toward the hall door
we say wilfully because his eyes were open, he was aware that reason and good sense were against it
he knew now tbaf the man in the worsted coat was right, and that thev would, in very truth, begin again where they had left off, and go on to this and that
his tiny hands play among the gilt trimmings of his nurse's waist; his head, in a lace cap trimmed with pale blue ribbons, lies sidewise on the pillow, turned heedlessly away from the preacher; he stares out into the room, at all his relatives, with an old, knowing look
standing and walking, he rather stuck out his abdomen, which hardly made an athletic impression; but his bearing at table was beyond cavil
young man, kiss this lovely woman good-night, upon her brow, said he to hans castorp
dh, do not be embarrassed
but they have both in themselves, i retorted; otherwise they could not have exhibited both of them
above her head, over the door, was a transparency, garlanded with evergreen, that said glory to god in the highest
no, my dear mother, i am not asking a written answer to this letter, for i am leaving to-morrow

he had mutton-chop whiskers that looked as though they had been dressed with gold paint
she held her stunted figure stiffly erect, tapped vigilantly on the table, cried nally or babby, and subdued mile
they are young--so much the better
it was not found among the papers leverkiihn left
he accepted the invitation almost before she gave it, with such alacrity that it was plain he had expected it
nowadays, when hans castorp relieved his mind, he did not hem and haw, become involved and stick in the middle
i dn not understand your tone
if they had been put him, he would have tapped his forehead with the tips of his fingers, and most certainly not have known—a phenomenon as disquieting as his incapacity to answer herr settembrini, that long-ago first evening, when the latter had asked him his age
that diseases, plagues, epidemics have to do with the position of the stars was to those times an intuitive certainty
no, i still have much on my heart about it and about certain of its characteristics, which - of course with undeviating admiration - disturbed and depressed me, or, better put, absorbed my attention even while they disturbed my mind
hans castorp started; looked at joachim, joachim at him
lord, herr consul, ye knaw what that is
his parents took the little coffin with them, back to their home
and joachim’s diaphragm rose quivering, as high as it could; the upper pans of the lungs could be seen to clear up, but the hofrat was not satisfied
a key- basket stood beside her
i am not de-ceiving you, he repeated, in the greatness of his need
naturellement, you think i have in mind your ferocious discipline, and que vous enchalnez votre art dans un systeme de regles inexorables et neo-classiques, forcing it to move in these iron bands - if not with grace, yet with boldness and esprit
kesselmeyer, you have sat at my table-- oh, be quiet with your table!
that nobility is comprehended in the mind, in the reason, and therefore you will level against me in vain the reproach of christian obscurantism— hans castorp demurred
her passion was betting; she staked against the gentlemen every conceivable object upon every conceivable subject: the weather, the dishes at dinner, the result of the monthly examination, the prescribed length of stay of this or that person, the champions in the skating, sleighing, bob-racing, and skiing competitions, the duration of this or that amour among the guests of the cure, and a hundred other, often quite indifferent or trifling subjects
she remained alone with her husband

nikolaus, a widower - his rife died young - had up to adrian's coming lived alone in the house with an old-established house- keeper, frau butze, a maid, and a young italian from brescia, named luca cimabue (he did actually bear the family name of the thirteenth-century painter of madonnas), who was his assist- ant and pupil at the trade of violin-making; for uncle leverkiihn also made violins
for he was by nature and temperament passive, could sit without occupation hours on end, and loved, as we know, to see time spacious before him, and not to have the sense of its passing banished, wiped out or eaten up by prosaic activity
he has short, curly blond hair and a smooth- shaven, bony face, with a somewhat theatrical range of ex- pression, from fanatical zeal to an exalted serenity
but he knows that that hour, four weeks ago, was a desperate one for mother and child; and he bends tenderly over gerda, who reclines in an easy-chair in front of him, next his mother, her feet, in patent-leather shoes, crossed before her on a velvet cushion
but he disturbed none of the traditional customs of the house
they drew obscene pictures on pieces of paper, passed them about, and laughed at them greedily
no longer of the youngest, already far on in the fifties, he applied himself to worl{ out a musical theory of his own, suited to his special requirements
it was hard, clavdia, even for a man phlegmatic in his passions

oh, there are a host more such titles in the upper reaches of the knights templars
it does one good, among such impressive performances, to con- tribute something oneself to the artistic entertainment, and i was gratified when excellence von riedesel, seconded at once by our long-legged elegant hostess, urged me in his south-german pro- nunciation, and voice made more strident by his officer's training, to repeat the andante and minuet of milandre () which i had once before played on my seven strings

he tried desperately to escape; knocked into a column with his shoulder—and found himself, with the sound of that dreadful whispered brawling still in his ears, still wrapped in the cold horror of it, lying by his hut, in the snow, leaning against one arm, with his head upon it, his legs in their skis stretched out before him
it is, by god's will, a daughter; i can find no words to express my joyful emotion
i had my suspicions—i can tell you now—from the first day i had the undeserved honour of making your acquaintance; i made a pretty shrewd guess that you were one of us and that you would find it out, like many another who has come up here on a lark and gone about with his nose in the air, only to discover, one fine day, that it would be as well for him—and not only as well, mark that—to make a more extended stay, quite without reference to the beauties of the scenery
i must dwell a little on this i point, and the sweeping gesture ac- companying it, this putting at the disposal of
but from this your school deduces in the first instance the right of the people to revolt from the monarchy
he did not  buddenbrook look like the semmlingers, having a yellow face and pointed teeth with wide spaces between
he’s even austere; he makes one feel rather uncomfortable, as if you were—well, shall i say as if you were being taken to task?
once, at a certain critical juncture now far in the past, he had made its action serve him for an allegory
thomas buddenbrodk took a solitary early breakfast in bis pretty dining-room
he was unusually pale, of a translucent, yes, phosphorescent pallor, that was further accentuated by the dark ardour of his eyes, the blackness of his brows, and his rather long, full whisker, which ended in two points and already showed some white threads
thomas buddenbrook would sit at his desk and watch until he saw his wife's friend enter the house
as they went along the corridor, hans castorp saw, beside two of the white-enamelled, numbered doors, certain curious, swollen-looking, balloonshaped vessels with short necks
for a long, dreadful minute she lay among the pillows as if stunned, as if paralysed
he made the duty calls which his position demanded; but the buddenbrook house was the only one at which he visited--too much, people thought, and the senator himself thought so too
and hans castorp took in a deep, experimental breath of the strange air
now, for a change, he was going downhill, with the wind in his face, when, at some distance before him, and seeming to hang in the driving wind and mist, he saw the faint outline of a human habitation
like that, he said, and gave his place to hans castorp, who assumed the same position
he remained the rest of the day in this condition, this heavy lethargy and intoxication, overpowered by the heady draught he had drunk, incapable of thought
how often had naphta not stood for instinct, what time settembrini called nature a blind force, mere factum et fatum, before which reason and human pride must never abdicate!
with tony and gerda here we ca not really talk--but i have already told you i have responsibilities--the last child, little gisela-- i know nothing about any little gisela--and i do not care to

i shall do well to leave the word entirely to him, since whatever adrian or i interpolated or replied played scarcely any role
he shows good taste, does not he, this canting money-grabber?
if you bring me that much back, that the thought of shar- ing my life with me is not utterly repugnant to her, not exactly monstrous - then my turn will come and i will speak 'with her and her aunt myself
cer- tainly specimens of the race have also crossed my path - i need only think of the private scholar breisacher in munich, on whose dismayingly unsympathetic character i propose in the proper place to cast some light
adrian spoke of the itch one felt to expose the unexposed, to look at the unlooked-at, the not-to-be and not-expecting-to-be looked-at
what i meant to ask you, he began, the case in my room had died just before i got here; have there been many deaths, since you came?
in uninter- rupted application he provided with musical settings all the poems in the mount of incense, some of them with two or three, and set to music all the hymns he had himself ever written, as well as a great many by his pupils

it was the same with satan himself
on the contrary, i am pitiful of that i make mine own, and ye may see in that an homage, a declaration of love for music, a special position towards her, that in her case i should feel quite too deeply pitiful

and so once more the patient}s familiar sur- roundings received him
how incapable he was of not keeping it!

what shall i take, papa?
that first utterance which the society of a catholic theologian had tempted from him was—however comparative and analytical in form—in substance a declaration of affection for the roman church, as a power at once spiritual and aristocratic (in other words anti-material), at once superior and inimical to worldly things (in other words, revolutionary)
settembrini spoke of his grandfather, a milanese lawyer, but even more a patriot; with something of the political agitator, and orator and journalist to boot

adrian might be cer- tain that elsbeth leverkiihn bore this loss with the same quiet resignation, the same understanding acceptance of the human lot, as lvlother schvveigestill showed
i have referred to his feeling of independence
schildknapp, with a reflective head-shake, even thought that one ought to set- tle down and live here; but frau sch\\leigestill had her doubts whether it would not be too lonely for a writer, too far fronl life and culture

shaving had grown burdensome to him, for some eight or ten days it had not been done, and he had now a strong growth of beard, setting off with a black frame his waxen face and gentle eyes
we were lewd enough, i do assure you; but too high-brow too, as they say in english
the younger children were mentioned, and the consul spoke of them with easy satisfaction, shrugging his shoulders

but, if you will permit me to say so, i can hardly subscribe to your deductions; i must deny them; my position is one of absolute dissent
never had i felt more strongly the advantage that music, which says nothing and everything, has over the unequivocal word; yes, the saving irresponsibility of all art, compared with the bareness and baldness of unmediated revelation
the great man’s face was yellow, the eyes pale beneath the forehead’s heavy folds, a bitter expression sat on the wounded lips

hans castorp raised his arms, to signify that there was so much written, on both sides, it was hard to know the rights of it

i-lis playing was neat and cultivated t his tone not large, but of beautiful sweetness and technically not a little brilliant
yet after all, this adaptation took place more rapidly than one might have thought possible; for was not time up here at the berghof arranged and organized to the end that one should get very rapidly used to things, even if the getting used consisted chiefly in getting used to not getting used?

'oh, do not mention it--i have been sitting for some time!

he may regard the general, impersonal foundations of his existence as definitely settled and taken for granted, and be as far from assuming a critical attitude toward them as our good hans castorp really was; yet it is quite conceivable that he may none the less be vaguely conscious of the deficiencies of his epoch and find them prejudicial to his own moral well-being
his facial expression was of one with something bad-tasting in his mouth, and he ate without a word
my god, breathed frau schönfeld at him, what a tan this demon has—he gets it from the helio—it makes him look like a hunter of eagles!

he had been successful in the past, but was that not because of the enthusiasm and impetus drawn from reflection?
the snow where it had been shovelled was melting and settling; the paths were beginning to be slushy; the friends wore their overshoes
the glass improvised inexhaustibly of the pangs of birth and the first kiss of lovers; the crown of sorrows, the fatherly goodness of god; plunged into the mysteries of creation, lost itself in other times and lands, in interstellar space; even mentioned the chaldeans and the zodiac; and would most certainly have gone on all night, if the conspirators had not finally taken their fingers from the glass, and expressing their gratitude to holger, told him that must suffice them for the time, it had been wonderful beyond their wildest dreams, it was an everlasting pity there had been no one at hand to take it down, for now it must inevitably be forgotten, yes, alas, they had already forgotten most of it, thanks to its quality, which made it hard to retain, as dreams are
but all the various conversations around the table flowed together in one stream when jean jacques hoffstede embarked upon his favourite theme, and began to describe the italian journey which he had taken fifteen years before with a rich hamburg relative

her pribislav eyes glided rapidly down his figure, as he sat there one knee over the other, with a deliberate insouciance which had all the effect of scorn; they paused for a space upon his yellow boots, and then carelessly, with perhaps a smile in their depths, withdrew

at that moment the glass door on the left slammed shut, with a rattle and ringing of glass; he did not start as he had on the first occasion, but only made a grimace of lazy disgust; when he wished to turn his head, he found the effort too much for him—it was really not worth while

for then herr wenzel, barber and member of the assembly, appeared, with his in-telligent face and his red hands, his razors and other tools, and the basin of warm water which he had fetched from the kitchen; and the consul sat in a reclining-chair and leaned his head back, and herr wenzel began to make a lather; and there ensued almost always a conversation that began with the weather and how you had slept the night beforr, wpnt on to politics and the great world, thence to domestic aflaiis in the city itself, and closed in an intimate and familiar key on business and family matters

the family feeling which led him to cherish the past history of his house extended itself even more strongly into its future; and he was influenced, too, by the loving and expectant curiosity concentrated upon his son by his family am] his friends and acquaintances, even by the buddenbrook ladies in broad street

for within, in the salon, there is a flower-decked small table, serving as an altar, with a young priest in black vestments and a stiff snowy ruff like a millstone round his neck,  reciting the service; and there is a great, strapping, particu-larly well-nourished person, richly arrayed in red and gold, bearing upon her billowing arms a small something, half smothered in laces and satin bows: an heir--a first-born son!

the roller, provided vvith metal tongues, turned along the tuned teeth of a comb and played, at first briskly and daintily, then slowly running down, three well-harmonized, demure little tinkling melodies, to which echo listened always with the same rapt attention, the same unforgettable mixture of delight, surprise, and dreamy musing
all i have to look out for is the dowry of my ward
the notice of the bridge party was attracted, the players were drawn by curiosity and came up holding their cards fan-shaped in their hands
sometimes, too, little buddenbrook was allowed to sit up with the organist at the sunday service in st mary's--which was quite a different matter from stopping below with the other people, in the nave
wherever he went, he suspected, he gibed, he vented his spleen; in short, his days were filled with hunting out and hounding down all his fellow-creatures who did not possess that inestimable advantage which was the only one he had

dr grabow came once more, to see that everything was being done

they both have their good sides; what i have against settembrini’s—the free-thinking line—is that he seems to imagine it has a corner in human dignity
then the carriage rolled along castle street and over the koberg, crossed broad street, and braked down the steep de-cline of fishers' lane
this giant lamento (it lasts an hour and a quarter) is very cer- tainly non-dynamic, lacking in development, without drama, in the same way that concentric rings made by a stone thrown into water spread ever farther, without drama and always the saine

well, tom, i must say i was ashamed of hagenstrbm

that a pastor from riga could thus bamboozle him behind his bark?
he did what he could with those two hands, often adding his voice, which crowed and cracked, but never badly; no, it was all even ravishing, by reason of its fervid musicality and enthusiastic rightness of expression
he ate enormously at dinner
evening, m’ boy, said behrens, who stood talking in low tones with krokowski and the oberin, and nodded ruefully to hans castorp, with his upper lip drawn back
they two, alone together, as two beings are together in only one other human relationship, have, like them, the one acting, the other suffering him, shared a secret that binds them for ever together

this show-piece did indeed give a singular tone to the silken chamber
the gentleman in the ulster looked at morten as one looks at a servant, blinking gently without seeing him, and said in a soft voice: is herr pilot-captain schwarzkopf at home?

the others would have burst out laughing again, but adrian shook his head at them with his finger on his lips
he sat on his revolving stool with his face turned towards us, in the same position as ours, bent over, hands between his l{nees, and in a few words brought to an end his lecture on why beethoven had not
he would approach his fea- tures mistrustfully to the glass, pull a wry face, hold his chin with thumb and forefinger, stroke his cheek in disgust and then wave his face away with the other hand so expressively that we, adrian and i, burst out in loud laughter

the products of animal metabolism, such as albumen, glycogen, animal starch, in short, were present in them
he does not hate us in the least
the persistence of poverty and sickness had been in the interest of both parties, and the position could be sustained just so long as it was possible to hold to the purely religious point of view
you can’t call it time,   quoth hans castorp, thick-tongued
it is on account of my cousin, herr hofrat
what he had said, at bottom, was that he alone had the right to enjoy the pleasant things we had been regaled with
he went on, and ran his hand down the whole of his left side, very close, but not touching it
it reminds me of things dr krokowski says in his monday lectures

every man, dumb with the shock, folded his hands upon his stomach and looked at his fellows or at the windows, where fists were being shaken in the air and the crowd was giving vent to deafening and frantic yelling

hagenstrbm!--the word seems to have corns from nobody knows where--down from the sky, or up from the earth
what do you make of that?

she said ly—ric, as hans castorp involuntarily noted
that was beautiful, and i praised it highly
of course, it is possible that she is consciously or unconsciously seeking a mate herself--but i know the child, and i feel sure she has never yet found her heart, as the saying goes
to mitigate adrian's acco\lnt by subjecting it to any kind of editing; to dismiss the dialogue in a few numbered paragraphs (will the reader please note the protesting quotation-marks i have given the word, vvithout concealing from myself that they can remove from it only part of its indwelling horror); to do this no regard for the possible failure of the reader's capacity could possibly move me
one believes in the coming of war if one does not sufficiently abhor it
they all sat down, and the consul and the broker talked by turns for the next few minutes
always the crass, obscenely comic figure of the divei has been nearer to them than the eternal majesty; and kumpf, in his way, was a man of the people

but the half-conscious cravings were stronger; and in the desire to have them strengthened and justified from outside, he first revealed his plan to his sister
rising on tiptoes to peer into joachim’s throat, she asked: tell me, young un, do you ever swallow the wrong way?
it seemed to hans castorp that not only he himself had arrived at this point, but that all the world, the whole show, as he said, had arrived there with him; he found it hard to differentiate his particular case from the general
he was not out for change, new sense impressions, distraction, recreation
and no wonder, he said to himself
hans castorp was silent a little space
they sang in chorus—one could understand the words quite well:
this invisible figure is frau van tolna and i cannot set her before the reader's eye or give the smallest idea of her outward appearance, for i have not seen her and never had a description of her, since no one i know ever saw her either
his mogith was small and mobile, with two yellowish pointed teeth in the otherwise vacant gum of his lower jaw, and he was pressing these into his upper lip, aa-he stood absently by the door with his hands in his trousers pockets and the black and white down on his head waving slightly, although there was not the least perceptible draught
the senator breakfasted hurriedly, and the frau consul, tony, clolhilde, and christian meanwhile took their leave
hans castorp was forced to acquiesce

inpossible, but refreshing, so adrian in a good mood characterized the work, which he had begun to write down even during the composition of the ensemble piece, carried in his mind and developed, burdened as it was with the work on the quartet, of which one would have thought that it alone must have consumed a man's organizing powers for long and to the utmost
several times the shattering, headlong destruction has come breath-takingly near my retreat
it belongs to the realm of the great confusion

taking walks up here is very beautiful—but appears to have its difficult side
vanity, said the hofrat, and vexation of spirit
who was it threw christian out?

it may cost the government a few window-panes--but that's all

still it seems to be the case, and i point it out in connection with the statement that leverl{uhn in the text for his incommensurable choral work by no means confined himself to the revelation of st john, but tool{ in this whole prophetic tradition, so that his work amounts to the crea- tion of a new and independent apocalypse, a sort of resume of the whole literature

senator langhals spoke with some heat
not all that happens in madness is therefore simply to be prevented, and the obligation to preserve life was in this case obeyed in scarcely anyone's interest save the mother's - for undoubtedly the maternal would prefer an irresponsible son to a dead one
the answer was in the sense that this defect only brouglt the lovable closer to the suffering soul; that without it there would have been no hope at all, it was just that which had made the fickle one ac- cessible to the cry of pain; more still, and revealing enough: that the shortening of life which ight result from it was ltiore of a consolation and assurance to her ,vho demanded possession than it was a moderation of her love
this director wulicke was a most formidable man

he passed on, in his everlasting check trousers, and left hans castorp behind, presumably, and to a certain extent actually, staggered by so much allusiveness; though he was stirred to irritation at its being taken for granted, and muttered through his teeth after the departing back: carducci-latini-humani-spagheti—get along, do, and leave me in peace!
stretching out his large, white hand, with the long, trembling fingers, he said agree, my dear young patron: eighty-four thousand marks--it is the offer of an honest old man
i am free to confess that the novel experiences of these kridwiss evenings, combined with my participation in adrian's solitary work, were responsible for the mental strain of my life at that time and in the end for the loss of a good twelve pounds' weight
from time to time he saw' rudiger schildknapp, the like-eyed,
i am inclined to look at people and say: so that’s you, is it?

bined cellos and flutes, half lyrically passionate and half burlesque, which in the prose, at the place , but her eye - by this light, but for her eye, i would not love her, recurs in a wildly carica- tured way, where the darkness of the eyes is intensified by the pitch, but the lightning flash of them is this time given to the pic- colo there can be no doubt that the strangely insistent and even unnecessary, dramatically little justified characterization of rosa- line as a faithless, wanton, dangerous piece of female flesh - a description given to her only in biron's speeches, whereas in the actual setting of the comedy she is no more than pert and witty - there can be no doubt that this characterization springs from a compulsion, heedless of artistic indiscrepancies, on the poet's part, an urge to bring in his own experiences and, whether it fits or not, to take poetic revenge for them
he arranged his small black felled hand upon the boy's shoulder, and looked up at thi

he said sententiously, and put his nose in the air
he seemed to be darkly dreaming for a moment; then he got up
adrian suggested that they should take a walk, one talked bet- ter walking
dr heidekind scolded, and insisted on a change of air; a complete change, not a stay at norderney or wyk on föhr—that would not mend matters this time, he said; if they wanted his advice, it was that hans castorp should go for a few weeks to the high mountains before he took up his work in the yards
be assured that thy psychological feints do not trap me, any better then do the theological
his stomach seemed to have a prejudice against the good cod-liver oil

next time (that would be in four weeks) it is bound to show further improvement
but christian's gaze flickered absently over her head; he would probably have stopped without her suggestion, for he seemed to be sunk in a profound, disquieting dream of maria and her depravity, while his little round deep eyes wandered back and forth
a mountain stream came flowing in its shallow, stony bed down the right-hand slope, poured itself foaming over the terraced boulders lying in its path, then coursed more calmly toward the valley, crossed at this point by a picturesque railed wooden footbridge

strange to say, hans castorp’s only reply to all this was a query as to whether it was possible to get porter up here; when joachim looked at him, in some astonishment, he perceived that his cousin was overcome with sleep, that in fact he was actually nodding

hans castorp looked at her, and all the modest and confiding friendliness native to him spoke in his eyes

tony looked a long time at her name and at the blank  space next it
the patient, hands folded on his chest, smiled daily at the blithe address, smiled with a friendly, albeit rather harassed mien, watching the doctor’s yellow teeth, that were visible through his beard

to condemn as incapacity or ignorance, even as clumsy primitivism, the rejection of perspective eye-deception by pre perspective art; even pityingly to shrug the shoulder over it: this, he declared to be the peak of silly modern arrogance
it dealt—at least possibly, if not quite admittedly—with the non-vital, with existences that took advantage of a ticklish, mysteriously and momentarily favouring chance to return to substantiality and show themselves to thair summoners—in brief, with the spiritualistic invocation of the departed

and then, with a start, we remember that he has disappeared from the stage, that his voice no longer swells the general concert--that he is, in short, departed from among us, and lies some-where ouside the walls, beneath the sod

your answer does not quite satisfy me—you must forgive me for disappointing you
i can’t depend on them—not only the first thought that comes into my head, but even the second one, the correction which my reason tries to make upon the first—more’s the pity
it was, of course, herr gr�, with an expression of im-ploring tenderness upon his face
the passionate rapidity of his approach even frightened hanno, at first
is that the doctrine of the roman church, which all the religious societies all over the world propagate by means of intrigue, or so they say?
then it was that hans castorp laughed
gerda would like to rest a little
there was an old post-man, with watery eyes, earrings, and a white beard--an an-cient oddity whom the senator used to salute on the street and call him herr postmaster: he came, stood in the doorway, and cried out ah hai not come fer that, herr se noter!
originally it was to have been three months
bathing and swimming--let the boy have bathing and swimming--he must bathe and swim, dr langhals had said
his patient was rather alarmed by the word comrade—who would have thought it?
do you remember, morten began again, i once said to you that there was a question i wanted to ask you?
and the homage he thus paid was genuine, and profound; for, as he himself explained, judaism, by virtue of its secular and materialistic leanings, its socialism, its political adroitness, had actually more in common with catholicism than the latter had with the mystic subjectivity and self-immolation of protestantism; the conversion of a jew to the roman catholic faith was accordingly a distinctly less violent spiritual rupture than was that of a protestant
even the hagenstroms have a flap
so you are against the works, he answered, and against physical nature, from which man comes and with him his incor- poreal part, which in the end does occur in other places in the cosmos
second class, to occupy less prominent places
this is a wonderful day, my dear son--a wonderful day, she repeated
hanno might fail his father in all that demanded vitality, energy and strength
very well; this is the object of the sociological pathology
she said, giving her query a curt, foreign intonation
next morning it showed °, climbing during the morning to the same level as before
i’d like to wait for the comrade’ though, he’ll be coming along presently, and just ask him if he is still of the opinion, in a case like this, that the physical is to be regarded as secondary
heavy ash-blond hair weighed down her head, so that she held it thrust out side- wise, with extended neck
people differ about that
he had the feeling, he said, that one should do the honours of mu- nich a bit for the ladies in pension gisela
yet it was not the same thing as borrowing a lead-pencil of a perfect stranger; one might even say it would have been ill-bred to pass by a lady with whom one had been for months under the same roof and not salute her
take off your things, father dear
she folded her arms, flung back her head, and looked at the ceiling while she spoke
oh, yes, you are
but her little brown eyes looked as shrewd and faithful as ever
and then the dream became reality
there, there, little darling--go to sleep now
not any more than i do,
it begins, he said, with the cult of the marble statue that had got down to the bottom of the sea, the boy, who is obviously by thorwaldsen, and her illegitimate taste for it
so when i have an opinion nowadays on these subjects, people listen to me
she looked pitiable indeed
oh, it's you, said the senator in a low voice, moving his lips cautiously
no justify thyself, was here; no challenge, no priestly court-martial upon one who strayed away and was forgotten of honour
we shall sleep to-night in a hotel and travel home to-morrow
joachim raised seven fingers
it is my painful duty to tell you that your husband is obliged to call his creditors together; that he cannot carry on his business any longer
fa sangue it vinol and amelia moved her spoons to and fro before her face and murmured: spiriti?
to rush into controversy with personalities, to be even forward of speech—but then to know how to extricate himself when need was, and his coat-tails, as it were, all but on fire!
no doubt he was grateful to his teacher for a kind of instruction
he could see them rolling up their velvet eyes and holding out their soft hats for the coins tossed from the windows
not blindly, but for that reason suffering the more; and my inward attitude was that of her mocking sister clarissa, who looked do,vn her nose at the other sex: i should have liked to say to him: hop, man!
he answered at once, composed, alert and energetic, and heard the voice of one of the nurses in the house, saying in high, uncertain tones that frau chauchat would be glad if he would come at once to the first storey
the rain rustled the half-leafless trees in the avenue, and sometimes gusts of wind drove it against the window-panes
fraulein buddenbrook will want to unpack
would hamburg consent to be a party to this prussian scheme?
oh, society doesn’t know what it wants
herr settembrini’s literary soul was pleased
they had wintered in rome, and in lvlay, as the heat strengthened, they had again sought the mountains and the same hospitable house where, in a sojourn lasting three months, they had learned to feel at home the year before
it was an attempt, a not utterly and entirely hopeless attempt (the second since the failure of bismarck and his unification per- formance) to norlnalize germany in the sense of europeanizing or democratizing it, of making it part of the social life of peo- ples
if this beastly ovid lesson were only over!
the family were dining on sunday in fishers' lane, and he de-scribed how he had to summon all his powers, and crawl on hands and knees to the window to shut it
fc'yes, tom, over the desk in your office, answered frau permaneder, and embraced her brother
the pillars were faced halfway up with wood finished to look like sandalwood, the upper part white-enamelled, like the ceiling and upper half of the walls
his sense of the comic, his fondness for it, his proneness to laughter, yes, to laughing till he cried, i have already spoken of, and i have given but a false picture of him if the reader has not seen this kind of abandon as an element in his nature
at the same moment ap- preaching steps were heard on the echoing flags within
hanno sat quite still, his small hands clasped round hid  buddenbrd dks knees, his mouth, as usual, a little twisted as his tongue fell out the hole in a back tooth
ah, that is most amusing!
he stoops when he walks, and rows along with his arms
he made a fine, sweeping gesture to wave away the imputation that he was a prosperous man
to-day she wore her dark red one
but she had been lucky: for just before the end of the term god in his loving-l{indness made her fall into the hands of the inquisition, and even under a slight degree of the question she had made a full and touchingly penitent confession, so that in all probability she obtained pardon from god
whether from his upbringing, or out of a natural idiosyncrasy, he loathed the slamming of doors, and could have struck the guilty person
he considered visiting pastor pringsheim and seeking advire and counsel; but he gave it up in the end for fear of being ridiculous
he had per- suaded himself to put the thundering response in tones which an- nounce the powerlessness of the creaturely good before good in itself: the latter, being itself the source of justice, cannot give way before anything that our human understanding is tempted to call unjust
but the others were silent: so profoundly silent that the director at length fell silent too
but hanno had a reason for absenting himself from the bathing, as well as from the skating and the drill class
i can only compare the feeling with the catch in the breath that a child feels in a sving as it flies aloft, the mingled exultation and terror
however that might be, it was clear that joachim was preoccupied with his own troubles; the thought of him could afford his cousin no mental support
we must keep together, he used to say to refractory pupils, pinching them on the arm
as large as a salon, with stone floors like all the rest of the house
adrian and rudiger visited the place by mere chance
his face was not striking, but it had at least the stamp of a strong and lively intelligence
which was certainly a large order of sentimental superficiality
but chris-tian, for a long, long time, eats no more peaches
on the business side we have said everything
it threw up on its surface a little protuberance, something like a mount of conception, through which it took the stick into itself, lengthwise
please, please get up
oh, that's just an expression--a figure
me he shall never see again, whatever he decides
but on foot how long is it?
in short, tony's intentions in the matter of her divorce were not the only dark spot in the consul's sky; and the journey to hamburg was pressing
this salon was furnished with upholstered fauteuils, bronze candelabra, little gilt occasional chairs, a sofa-table ,vith a bro- cade cover, and a richly framed, very much darkened oil painting of , representing the golden i-iorn wlth a view of gai
lawyer paravant and frau stöhr went white and red by turns; the latter suffered pangs of indecision when called on to decide whether it was too high for her to buy at eighteen
one could not help feeling that it was by way of being a compensa- tion and atonement for the loss of human happiness and mutual love which had befallen him
the wind came up and blew the thick veils of water, tore them apart, and flung them about
tom, we will get to work
this is the reve-lation: that i shall live!
why are you sitting here writing in the dark?
is it not the antithesis of hedonism?
when i think that you have passed all your life in these surroundings--in fact-- with some interruptions, said frau permaneder, in that extraordinarily throaty voice of which she sometimes availed herself
stine voss, who lived by the city wall, and mike stuht from bell-founders' street, and fike snut from the river-bank or groping alley, their straw-coloured locks smoothed back with a wet comb, crossed the entry into the garden-room, which for a long time now had not been used as an office, and in which rows of benches had been arranged and frau consul buddenbrook, born kroger, in a gown of heavy black satin, with her white re-fined face and still whiter lace cap, sat opposite to them at a little table with a glass of sugar-water and catechized thrm for an hour
it sounded like a chal-lenge, like a little trumpet-call
when he was obliged to go into the city, adrian brought the boy all sorts of presents: various animals, a jack-in-the-box, a toy railway with lights that switched on and off as it roared round the curves; a magic casket in which the greatest treasure was a glass filled with red wine which did not run out when the glass was turned upside dovvn
yes, how much has happened that had its effect on my own solitary activities, while yet i refused to look without-doors!

as for myself, i am a humanist, a homo humanus
i carry yours here
what extravagance, what fanaticism, it will be said!
the abstract, the refined-upon, the ideal, is at the same time the absolute—it is sternness itself; it contains within it more possibilities of deep and radical hatred, of unconditional and irreconcilable hostility, than any relation of social life can
he was obliged to spend much time in bed, not only on the days when the quartan fever held sway, but on others too
he has never seen any-thing like it, i am sure
it was a jewel of great beauty and - to me - incalculable value
he had been there a half-hour earlier, and given a camphor injection; had scarcely been absent for more than the moment of the short crossing
just lie still on your back
his name was wiedemann, a christian name, not a filthy jewish
what an effete and obsolete procedure burial was, under our modern conditions—the price of land, the expansion of our cities and consequent shoving of the graveyards out on to the periphery!
it would be the abandonment of certain comprehensive responsibilities which had grown up out of his contemplation of the image called homo dei; it would be the betrayal of that appointed task of stock-taking, that hard and harassing task, which was really beyond the powers native to him, but yet afforded his spirit such nameless and adventurous joys; that task it was his duty to perform, here in his chair, and up there in his blue-blossoming retreat
there were lively times here in the restaurant on occasion, joachim said, and champagne flowed freely
having spent a year with adrian in leipzig, i know how he lived during the other three of his stay there; his manner of life being so regular and conservative that i found it rigid and some- times even depressing
she wept over herr weinschenk's top-hat, the way he raised his eyebrows at sight of her and let them fall; over his regal bearing and his balancing fists
such were the motives that led him to force his way so blandly into the retreat where genius created and suffered

the document is extant, i will report on it in its proper place
pas prccisement humain mais ex- tremement respectable
again the consul was obliged to stop eating and lean back in his chair to laugh
the treatment was not wrong, but it was just possibly one-sided
others sat straining forward to fling the bait far out
he, kretschmar, would leave the ques- tion open, how far adrian was accusing himself in order to ex- cuse his corresponding accusations against art; for this painting art as a marriage with the mob, as kiss-throwing, gala-posturing, as a bellows to blow up the emotions, was a facile misconstruction and a wilful one too
the sleigh or carriage halted before the door, coachman and porter strapped fast the trunks, while friends gathered about to say good-bye to the departing one, who, cured or not, and whether for life or death, was off for the flat-land
imagine how i felt!
and even here at home there was another source of worry--for, as yet, there was no certainty whatever that the family name would live
disease has nothing refined about it, nothing dignified
he should have gone a step further and said that a good style would lead to good deeds, settembrini added
hanno could not stop laughing
the reader, on the other hand, may very likely find such adjectives the only ones suitable to describe hans castorp’s personality or emotions
take your wineglass, young man, i will use the water-glass again, it does the crude new wine no shame— with his trembling hand he filled the glasses, hans castorp hastening to assist him
you have worked hard--that must suffice
but there were other, more perceptive regions
the green blinds in frau gr�'s sleeping-room were gently stirred by the mild air of a june night, for the win-dows were open
the beaten french tasted this awful experience in , vhen their negotiators, seeking to soften the conditions of the victors, priced very high the renown, la gloire, ensuing from the entry of our troops into paris
i remember the house-warming
of late the assistant spent no more time with this particular patient than with the others, but confined himself chiefly to the well, comrade?
his placidity was fully restored by the appearance of the steaming dishes, with their burden of canary-yellow besprent with green, which dispersed a mild warm fragrance of eggs and butter upon the air
but on the way to breakfast, and later in the course of the day, they talked about the direction of the berghof sanatorium, and joachim, in his character as inmate, answered his cousin’s questions
who, what, how could i be, if i were not i--if this my external self, my consciousness, did not cut me off from those who are not i?
please do not make phrases
the cousins met in the corridor and descended the stair
yes, my dear good mother: i am complying with the request to send my solemn consent to clara's be-trothal from the amstel to the baltic
the times are not good for merchants
he would leave the office in the midst of work, seized with unrest, and roam about the garden, sometimes pausing as if he felt confined in his movements, sighing, and covering his eyes with his hand
go on with your work
they showed their necks and bosoms, they transfigured their arms by veiling them in illusion; they did so, the world over, to arouse our desire
but perhaps it is only the excitement of thr, celebration
i have no great fondness for balls, and having the young people jumping about here; and, be-sides, there is not room
a single light burned in the hall ceiling—and in the adjoining salons dimness reigned
dnce a week they sat at the extension table in the dining-room by the light of lamps and candles
every lady said to frau consul or her daughter: what a treasure your mamsell is, my dear!
no, he had become inwardly aware—one could conceive him paling at the thought—that even as it was, after only a week up here, he would find eyerything down below wrong and out of place, and that the feeling would last a considerable time before readjustment set in: it would seem to him unnatural to go to his office, instead of taking a prescribed walk after breakfast, and thereafter lying ritually wrapped, horizontal in a balcony
the movements with which he took up paper and writing materials were so short and jerky that herr marcus ran his two fingers up and down his beard and gave his colleague a long, scrutinizing look
from far and wide scholars came to converse with him—one from haparanda, another from cracow— they came to our city of padua, expressly to pay him homage, and he received them with dignified friendliness
hurry, do you hear?
it had happened that the sonata had come, in the second, enormous movement, to an end, an end without any return
your skin gets like a file, and if the stimulus is very powerful, the hair ducts are erected too, the hair on your head bristles up and the little hairs on your body, like quills upon the fretful porcupine—and you can say, like the youth in the story, that now you know how to shiver and shake
he would drink no beer to-day; he would drink nothing at all, or at most a swallow of water
i should not conceal from you, he went on, that the firm has suffered losses already quite apart from this affair, and that the surrender of a sum like this would be a blow from which it would recover with difficulty
i am refusing you--for heaven's sake, ca not you understand?
the lovers sat quietly together hand in hand, and spoke gently and earnestly of the beautiful future before them
lawyer paravant had received out of transcendency a sounding slap on the cheek, and had countered with scientific alacrity, yes, had even eagerly turned the other cheek, heedless of his quality as gentleman, jurist, and onetime member of a duelling corps, all of which would have constrained him to quite a different line of conduct had the blow been of terrestrial origin
schwerdtfeger, a little to the left of the first vio- lin, whose place he was soon to tal{e, stood with his instrument under his arm, warm and beaming, face towards the hall and nodding to us with not quite permissible familiarity, while inez, at whom i could not resist stealing a glance, with her head thrust out, her mouth mischievously pursed, kept her eyes obstinately directed at some other point on the stage, perhaps on the leader, or no, farther along, on the harps
an astonishing growth of hair, a wilderness of tight little curls, red-brown mixed with grey, made his head look big and heavy, though it was poised easily upon a long neck with an extremely large adam's apple that showed above his low collar
if that is an error, and while without doubt it was an error to yield to the temptation to bring in pfeiffering and the schweigestills before their time, i would implore the reader to attribute such irregu- larities to the excitement which has possessed me since i began this biography, and to tell the truth not only as i write
but there is one power, one principle, which commands my deepest assent, my highest and fullest allegiance and love; and this power, this principle, is the intellect

he keeps trying to open them wide, and has made a lot of wrinkles, regular corrugations, that turn up on the temples and run straight across his forehead, and his forehead is high and red, with long wisps of white hair
if we don’t think so, our judgment is corrupted
yes, these were two different worlds
hans castorp, horrified, shook his fist at her, but she scarcely grasped his meaning; she was far from any thought of sparing joachim’s feelings, and too matter-of-fact to dream that anyone, least of all the next of kin, could be in any doubt as to the character and issue of this illness
breathe deep, he commanded
it surely did not escape this haughty person with the too short chin when superiority, on grounds which have nothing to do ,-ith superiority, gave something away and ,vas just as certainly of the opinion that it gave nothing away
oh, really, very good!
he had been too careless, too generous to attain a solid position in the mercantile world
quite right, of course, but 'head bare at prayer was al- ways my -  prayer, finished dr breisacher relentlessly, is the vulgarized and rationalistically watered-down late form of something very vital, active and strong: the magic invocation, the coercion of god

the man is a boon—for god’s sake, is he not a personality?
but consul hagenstrbm's son limped perceptibly when he went home
anyhow, nobody for a long time thought of connecting young adrian in any way with music
he put away the book in the drawer of the garden table
wehsal shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that precisely that extreme case was a contingency; thus reducing to silence hans castorp, who was inclined to forget the fact
behrens did not set a limit; he is a long-headed man, and doesn’t play the prophet
would holger not make up some poetry for them?
but now it was her haven, her hap- piness: a bourgeois happiness, which obviously looked more acceptable because it possessed the charm of novelty; the foreign nationality was a new frame into which she would be trans- planted
anonymous and communal, said hans castorp
well, tony, what do you say to it?
- i have always feared adrian's proneness to laughter, never been able, like rudiger schild knapp, to play a good second to it; and the same fear, the same shrinking and misgiving awkwardness i feel at this gehen- nan gaudium, sweeping through fifty bars, beginning with the chuckle of a single voice and rapidly gaining ground, embracing choir and orchestra, frightfully swelling in rhythmic upheavals and contrary motions to a fortissimo tutti, an overwhelming, sar- donically yelling, screeching, bawling, bleating, howling, piping, whinnying salvo, the mocking, exulting laughter of the pit
thus he would speak of the dos banderas—the two standards—the satanic and the celestial, beneath which the armies gathered for the great struggle: the one near jerusalem, where christ was the capitán general of all the faithful, the other on the plains of babylon, of which the caudillo or chieftain was lucifer
i will keep faith with death in my heart, yet well remember that faith with death and the dead is evil, is hostile to humankind, so soon as we give it power over thought and action
kretschmar had not allowed it to upset his belief in the calling of his pupil
and when i am his wife, you will see, ida, i will take care that he has ambition and gels ahead and makes an effort and is a credit to me and all of us
the cousins sat at a table by themselves, rather apart from the others, for hans castorp was smoking with his dark beer, which he had brought out from breakfast
her daughter-in-law, frau consul elizabeth buddenbrook, born kroger, laughed the sputtering kroger laugh and tucked in her chin as the kr�s did

but when it is fixed upon a human being, with a human face, then we begin talking about love
old fiete shooed it cautiously away, taking care not to touch the forehead of the dead, putting on a seemly air of absent-mindedness—of obscurantism, as it were—as though he neither might nor would take notice of what he was doing
he does not turn his head, on purpose, but i can see by the expression of his back that he is listening
it would upset everything, they would have to begin all over

jean, if you love me--do you want to expose yourself to this danger?
this new evil genius had, like the other, always been present, as it were, in the germ, but now it began to spread itself; hans castorp had by nature no great predilection for becoming its slave; yet with something like horror he observed that even he, when he let himself go ever so little, fell victim to a contagion so general that scarce anyone in the circle escaped it
he could scarcely see for the fog
well, daghestan—i don’t know the climate, it is probably better, when all is said and done, than being right down on the water

director wulicke gave utterance to a sound that was as though the lowest string of his double-bass had been violently plucked, and herr modersohn wrung his small, clumsy, inky hands repeating plaintively over and over
they parted, with a brief see you later at the door of number thirty-four; hans castorp piloted himself through his room to the balcony, where he dropped just as he was upon his deck-chair and, without once shifting to a more comfortable posture, sank into a dull half-slumber, broken by the rapid beating of his unquiet heart
noth- ing harder, generally speaking, than getting into real paris society
of course in these pages i can only picture in a foreshortened form, just as i did with his school-days, the two years of our youth that i spent at halle with my friend; the course of them interrupted, indeed, by holidays in kaisersaschern and at his fa- ther's farm
opposed to it stood the protestant, the pietistic sphere, which had its origin in mysticism
friendship which caused me much distress and alarm, but always filled me too with pride: genius is a forin of vital power deeply experienced in illness, creating out of illness, through illness crea- tive
he proceeded to show himself immensely well informed upon current events, and gave his approval to the state of world affairs, in so far as they were running a course favourable to the progress of civilization

adrian talked with spengler, who was already in wretched health, his disease having attacked his heart, and laughed with the rest of us at the clowneries of leo zink, who leaned back at table and covered hinself with his huge damask serviette like a sheet up to his fantastic nose and folded his hands peace- fully atop
if man fails in feeling, it is blasphemy; it is the surrender of his masculinity, a cosmic catastrophe, an irreconcilable horror— he drank

settembrini glared at him
there were, on the other hand, the two sons of consul hagenstrbm, two fine strapping boys, twelve and four-teen years old, strong and full of spirits, who instituted prize-fights in the neighbouring woods, were the best gymnasts in the school, swam like otters, smoked cigars, and were ready for any deviltry
he tried various devices to disguise the weakness, for he could not continually support his chin on his collar; he would keep his head in action, turning it to the right and left in conversation, or bear hard against the table with the left forearm when he carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth, and support his head with his hand
i am a grown man-- you do not in the least know what you have to do

consul buddenbrook kissed his daughter on the forehead and said, go up to your child, antonie
herr k�n felt a great need to unfasten a few buttons of his waistcoat; but it obviously would not do, for not even the el-derly gentlemen were permitting themselves the liberty

and thomas buddenbrook said yes and amen
but there came to be another, more definite goal to his glances, at table, on their walks, and in the salon of an evening
but just here, it seems to me, lies the excuse for vice (you must pardon me, but i incline by nature to excuses, though there is nothing large’ about them—i am quite clear on that point) in so far as it is a result of impotence
leverkiihn, to 'whom i conveyed these impressions of mine, 'was unusually ailing at this time, in a way that had something humili- ating in its torments
on the periphery of its field it would come in contact with the marked counters; and if the letters on these, when put together, made words that conveyed any sort of sense, the resultant phenomenon would be complex and contaminate, a mixed product of conscious, half-conscious, and unconscious elements; the actual desire and pressure of some, to whom the wish was father to the act, whether or not they were aware of what they did; and the secret acquiescence of some dark stratum in the soul of the generality, a common if subterranean effort toward seemingly strange experiences, in which the suppressed self of the individual was more or less involved, most strongly, of course, that of little elly
she had a good little head, and did as well in the school as one could desire; but her conduct in other ways was far from satisfactory

no, he did not like going to school--the old monastic school with its cloisters and vaulted classrooms
ah, the fatal facility of youth!
he agreed to the qualification, the more easily because what he had vaguely in mind was as un- wagnerian as possible, and most remote from nature-d
he sought again and again to pull himself together, to clear his countenance, to tell himself that this was a great day which was bound to heighten and exhilarate his mood
we all call her that up here, because it’s the only thing she says
one group of records contained the closing scenes of a certain brilliant opera, overflowing with melodic genius, by a great countryman of herr settembrini, the doyen of dramatic music in the south, who had written it to the order of an oriental prince, in the second half of the last century, to celebrate the completion of a great technical achievement which should bind the peoples of the earth together
you see, the pattern repeats itself on the whole set
germany is free, in so far as one may apply the word to a land prostrate and proscribed
yet the last traces of the sunset linger above and beyond
in the spring there had been a street riot, although a con-stitution corresponding to the demands of the new time had already been drafted; which, a little later, despite the opposition of lebrecht kroger and other stubborn old gentlemen, be-came law by a decree of the senate
such a position requires no certificate or juristic training; it is arrived at after a term of years of preliminary service by passing the examinations for sec- retary in chief
not so hans castorp
no, for even the house, the courtyard, and the family itself were all very like the buchel setting
youth in the ultimate sense has nothing to do with political his- tory, nothing to do with history at all
he stooped slightly too, or rather, shrank together; though even so he overlooked herr ludovico, and was a whole head taller than little naphta
as they sat, behold, there came hofrat behrens through the garden
the equipage turned into the mengstrasse, and the fat brown horses stood snorting and stamping before the buddenbrook door
the authorities had ceased to devise him distractions
he rejected all idea of a monstrosity, whatever attaches in the popular mind to mythological combinations of the human and the animal; and declared that he did not find admissible mytho- logical fictions of that kind
there was too much red all over the face, the nose was badly out of drawing, the colour of the hair badly hit off, too straw-colour; the mouth was distorted, the peculiar charm of the features ungrasped or at least not brought out, spoiled by the exaggeration of their single elements
yet it was enough for him to breathe other air, be exposed to other influences, to bring about a complete estrangement, a hope- jess aloofness in the place of confidence and mutual understand- ing
he has nerve enough--it would not trouble him at all
only it sounds strange to hear it like that, hans castorp said
and this philistine philosophy, this gospel of work and reason, served herr settembrini as an ethical system
sister alfreda had already packed her little trunk and left the berghof, to go to another moribundus in another establishment
the hofrat had seen the old as well as the fresh spots, and strands ran from the bronchial tubes rather far into the organ itself—strands with nodules
who told you so?
sometimes it was even malignant, this outward beauty: certain conical snails, charmingly asymmetric specimens bathed in a veined pale rose or white-spotted honey brown, had a notoriously poisonous sting
the thing was to achieve an absolute cure, and to that end behrens had just lately socked him another six months
of germany the, opposite is true, and tl:at you would feel and know, leverkiihn, if you were not adrian leverktihn - in other words, too cool to be young, too clever to be religious
he was not going to the meeting-place to be salved and bandaged, but to lay about him, and that in grim earnest
behrens never recognized him, though it was broad day, and our beginner had well-nigh collided with him
he had a great weakness for the theatre and for other distractions of the great city
sundered from the shepherd of his original fold, orphaned, forsaken, full of craving after freer air and forms of existence upon which his native gifts gave him a claim, naphta, who was long past the age of consent, was so impatient for profession that he saved his patron all the trouble of winning this soul—or rather, this extraordinary head—for his sect
i do not doubt it, said he, and doubt not of its success
natu-rally, she received summary notice
she was weak enough!
now, hold your head up--let your arms hang down quietly at your sides
accordingly, in the nike salon, rosa schneidewein was served with coffee and the little one with milk and cake
i-ie was greatly enlivened
the first word she pronounced dolce, with some reminiscence of her musical husband’s italian vocabulary; but the second suggested jubilee, or an attempt to yodel, or goodness alone knew what
if chance took her up or down the stairs just as herr weinschenk passed that way--and chance did this not seldom--the director took off his top-hat, displaying his short black hair, which was already greying at the temples, minced rather more than ever at the waist of his frockcoat, and greeted the young girl with an admiring glance from his bold and roving brown eye
the many-sidedness of his activities, while they made me anxious for his health, his thirst for experience, accompanied as it was by a critical attitude, justified such dreams
dead and buried hopes spring once more to life--and again are blasted
once more he would rejoice in real, solid time, the long, vital years of youth
i see that i must be very quiet, for the present
by which he meant that he still had an interminable deal of work to do before he arrived at the goal and could  settle back to enjoy himself
joachim, preux chevalier, said something to her in english, which she answered in a monosyllable without ceasing to chew, and relapsed again into silence
but this was to much for his powers of self-command, his shrewdness and resource
weak human being that he was—though tolerably well equipped with the weapons of civilization—what he at this moment knew was the fascination of venturing just so far into the monstrous unknown, or at least abstaining just so long from flight before it, that the adventure grazed the perilous, that it was just barely possible to put limits to it, before it became no longer a matter of toying with the foam and playfully dodging the ruthless paw—but the ultimate adventure, the billow, the lion’s jaws, and the sea
hans castorp too, though there was echoing in his ears that large-hearted of course, of course out of the past, held back, and at the last moment was rather inclined to pass the choice on
that was, of course, the right way not to go to sleep, and now he felt not the slightest inclination
stopped close in their houses
i have just been coming to that conclusion
i read it too, of course, for want of a better one; but it is not so very thrilling to hear that wholesale dealer consul so-and-so is going to celebrate his silver wedding!
i am next you on the right
the ends of sievert tiburtius' long, thin whiskers are parted over his shoulders, and his small grey eyes now and then open wider and wider, most unexpectedly, and grow larger and more prominent till they almost jump out of his head
but i cannot wait any longer
at the moment of slipping off one might give a start—yet what sleep could be purer than this in the icy air?
the first time i came up, nobody was near enough to get hold of me; the second time, the scow went over my head
when we were schoolboys we used to pinch each other's arms and say: 'what is the name of the river at swartau?
after the music, however, there would be a long explanation of the relation of this style of music to that of the strenge satz; and one day herr pfiihl admitted that, while not personally interested in the theme, he saw himself obliged to add a chapter to his book on church music, the subject of which would be the application of the old key-system to the church- and folk-music of richard wagner
i-ie had a social presence and had been en- nobled personally by the late king; was much sought after and high-priced
a keen and tortured intellect breathed in the words, and, probing further, the good father discovered a command of fact and a caustic elegance of thought made only the more surprising by the ragged exterior of the youth
then you sat down and began to put the inner one about you: first lengthwise, on both sides, up to the shoulders, and then from the feet up, stooping over as you sat and grasping the folded-over end, first from one side and then from the other, taking care to fit it neatly into the length, in order to ensure the greatest possible smoothness and evenness
but the consul, after sunday supper, in the hall, made the discovery, thanks to the décolleté of frau redisch’s spangled black frock, that her bosom was very white and voluptuous, the breasts pressed together so that the crease between them was visible for some way; and the mature and elegant gentleman was as much shaken by this discovery as though it possessed for him a new and undreamed-of significance
but that he had never done in the klammer pool, only in its counterpart at buchel, the cow trough
the look he directed upon me as i approached had something violent and unbalanced about it, quickly resolved, to my great grief, in gloomy repugnance
what is there to hear, my dear wenzel?
therese weichbrodt had given up her pensionnat in the past year
the sky above the valley was a deep southern blue and the pastures beneath, with the cattle tracks running across and across them, still a lively green
all works of art whose function it is to express the soul and the emotions, naphta responded, are always so ugly as to be beautiful, and so beautiful as to be ugly
but do explain this one thing to me, he went on
hans castorp said whimsically
he marked off the outer limits by lines dug with his heel in the snow, the inner by means of two canes, his own and settembrini’s
but they did recommend it, from the beginning
is not it possible for him to leave himself time enough?
it seemed as though he feared and avoided not only the indelicate expression of deep and solemn feeling, but even the feeling itself
no, she is dead
ever since the first sunday in advent a great gaily coloured picture of a certain ruprecht had been hanging on the wall in grandmama's dining-room
of course this misfortune was only revealed afterwards
his table-mates grasped quickly the state of affairs
i am lying up here, he said, paying full pension
upon this point elly was silent
the management was on the ground-floor
we are familiar with that spirit—and we have no great love for it
how make plain to the sober intelligence of the flat-land the changes that took place in the inner economy of our young adventurer?
over his waistcoat he wore a long, thin gold chain that had belonged to his grandfather, and on the fourth finger of his broad but delicately articulated right hand was the old seal ring with the green stone
yes--pneumonia, said dr langhals, with a solemn and correct bow
it was undoubtedly aware of itself, so soon as it was life; but it did not know what it was
they did not even spend the night at schweigestill's, for both had to work next morning and must take the train back from waldshut to munich
a moment later she leaned over and began to count the prune-pits on her brother's dessert-plate: tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor--finishing triumphantly with senator when she came to the last pit
eternal snow, if you like
ah, it was already familiar to their ears; yet he would wager the cousins had never before rightly grasped its meaning and its majesty: the word was—civilization!
it is probably not only disgraceful, but stupid into the bargain
as for exports, well, we send a little corn to holland and england, it is true
she began to guess
somebody gasped with the effort he made--then all was still again
wherever heir ballerstedt thought explanation necessary, he puffed himself up, said well!
it was cut with a modest little round neck like a schoolgirl’s frock, hardly so much as to show the base of the throat, or the collar-bones, or the slightly prominent bone at the back of the neck, beneath the soft fringes or her hair
the devil fly away with gaffky!
and he was underhanded
he began in a low murmur, so that very few understood his opening sentence or made anything out of it
of course they did not - how should they?
it was early afternoon
ah, the principles and points of view constantly did that; it became so hard for hans castorp’s civilian responsibility to distinguish between opposed positions, or even to keep the premisses apart from each other and clear in his mind, that the temptation grew well-nigh irresistible to plunge head foremost into naphta’s morally chaotic all
they stood and looked out over the dripping slope across the narrow, stony strip of beach, out to the turbid, restless sea
what he actually lacked, in fact, was an emotional bridge between two extremes
that italian who—whom i did not like
strangeness, tension, even suppressed hostility there was of course enough between them; it is surely rather remarkable that a comparatively insignificant personality could have held them together
afterwards, too, he realized that frau stöhr had nudged dr blumenkohl in the side, and then looked about at their own and other tables, trying to catch people’s eyes
for the rest, he asserted his independence to himself and others by the funda- mental refusal to be obliging: when one needed him, he was defi- nitely not to be had
career--what a lovely word 'career' is!
the removal of joachim to this stately receptacle, decorated with lions’ heads and rings, was the sole affair of the man who came along with it, a black-clad functionary of the undertaking establishment which had the arrangements in hand
my own name--if i may be-permitted to mention it, he continued, waxing eloquent, is-that of most of my forefathers--bendix
in the beginning it is all pretty good; but why do you suddenly fall from b major into the six-four chord on the fourth note with a minor third?
he was quite absurdly surprised to hear that there still existed such things as freemasons; and diligently plied the terrorist with questions about the origin and significance of this curious body, which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth birthday
to es- tablish a fixed relation between the values of the notes did not
feddermann, he said, will you please recite the poem?
when he laughs he draws the air in through his teeth in little jerks
but the words sounded strained
soon afterwards, however, she prepared to leave tow!l and fill an en- gagement as jeune prelziere in the provinces, which her teacher, who played father parts at the hoftheater, had got for her
things even went so far that one day the school-mistress, a certain fr�ein agathe vermehren, felt obliged to call upon the frau consul, and, flushed with embarrassment, to suggest with all due politeness that the child should receive a paternal admonition
in other words, they would ask the bathing-master to see the oberin, in order that something might be done to relieve the sufferer
five hundred cows are before your mind's eye, said gerda, looking at her in the mirror
i can sit down yonder on those boulders
despite his tanned face and broad shoulders his health was not always sound and as a younger man he had spit blood; in other words, tended to be tubercular
it was an extra occasion, i enjoyed it no end—
we dealt with the matter of our present mode of ex- istence; and deutschlin protested that it was poor taste for youth to explain youth: a form of life that discusses and examines itself thereby dissolves as form, and only direct and unconscious being has true existence
while they went across the court, thomas said: we will walk a few steps up and down the garden, my friend
war, then, and if needs inust, war against everybody, to convince everybody and to win; that was our lot, our sending (the very word we use is germanic, the idea pre-christian, the whole concept a tragically mythological, musical-dramatic motif); that was what fate had willed, and 'we - only we!
you are very kind, papa, the consul's wife said
there was given to lle a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of satan, to buffet me
but that is just the kind of people you pick out to say such things to!--if it is neces-sary to say them at all--and so you lay yourself open to an insolent snub like that
i happened to hear somebody say so, and it just crossed my mind
i shall not be going too far in saying at once that she is politically suspect
i am only eager to make the acquaintance of the great unknown, the bringer of the terror
he does seem rather weird, was hans castorp’s view
i wanted to tell you that i am about to -  i told him what i was about to do, told him about helene, how i had met her and we had got to know each other
i am quite willing to give adrian's favourite vvith the like-co loured eyes due credit for the suggestion
they did so—by the latter
said he, not looking up
he was right not to take the separation seriously
upon which, herr gr� made another deep bow, settled himself again, stroked his beard, and coughed as if to say: well, let us get on
it hovered before him, somewhere in space, remote from his grasp, yet near his sense; this body, this opaquely whitish form, giving out exhalations, moist, clammy; the skin with all its blemishes and native impurities, with its spots, pimples, discolorations, irregularities; its horny, scalelike regions, covered over by soft streams and whorls of rudimentary lanugo
such was his ignorant and hypochondriac judgment, right only as to the unfruitfulness of the result, but there wholly
when they returned, rudolf re- joiced in the prerogative that up to then, from our childhood on, had been mine alone: he and adrian were per due
rudi schwerdt- feger, zinl{ and spengler, even schildknapp, they were all there
i think it’s quite possible i shan’t be able to stop, that i’ll have to leave—you wouldn’t take it amiss, would you?
is there perhaps some porter?
he was a native of north-western germany, and it was common knowledge that when he took the position, years ago, he had done so contrary to his previous intention and plans
let us shut our eyes, safe in eternity!
he was faithful to morning and evening prayers, asked per-mission to attend one of the frau consul's sunday school classes, and even appeared on a jerusalem evening in the drawing-room and was presented to the guests, but withdrew affrighted when lea gerhardt began to read aloud
then you are a phenomenon worthy of study
we don’t feel the cold, hans castorp said, with tranquil brevity
we are at the end, i suppose
then came the ferry, and israelsdorf avenue, jerusalem hill, the castle field
you will tire of it—and then, i am not prudish, not an outraged middle-class housewife—
he had looked on enough at the sport to know the use of his tools; and choosing for his practice-ground an almost treeless slope not far behind the sanatorium, remote from the hubbub of the spot where other beginners learned the art, he began daily to make his first blundering attempts, watched by herr settembrini, who would stand at a little distance, leaning on his cane, with legs gracefully crossed, and greet his nursling’s progress with applause
what do you mean by that?
he stands still in the doorway, with his flowers held out in front of him, and be-gins straightway to speak
at half past ten the servant came from the house to announce that the frau senator was receiving guests in the salon
he must have been, at bottom, cruelly bored by the small, safe business he did and the petty trans-fer of this or that bit of property; for this loss, this tragic blow with which heaven had stricken him down--him, the schemer cosch--delighted his inmost soul
what i call natural and international law, you are free to call the ius divinum
do you think i’ve no eyes in my head?
yet in their pure white dress they afforded a scene of glorious winter splendour, mounting bold and austere between wooded gorge and wide expanse as we wound among them
joachim availed himself of both, finding they gave relief
there were pots of marmalade and honey, basins of rice and oatmeal porridge, dishes of cold meat and scrambled eggs; a plenitude of butter, a gruyère cheese dropping moisture under a glass bell
you are right, replied the consul
everything was going well, his predictions seemed about to be verified
no, it doesn’t trouble me
but this he only said with his reason—to some extent detached from the rest of him, though after all nearly concerned
stu-pid and lazy both--it is really too much
its concern is a cosmology proper to fcaisersaschern and its towers: it leads to astrology, to observation of the position of the planets, the constellation and its favourable or unfavourable indications - quite naturally and rightly, for nothing is clearer than the intimate interdependence of the bodies of a cosmic little group so closely bound together as our solar system, and their near neighbourly mutual reference
the first hint came when i saw among his papers a note that he had written with a broad pen-nib: this sadnesse moved dr faustum that he made note of his lamentacyon
then he stood a long time in the death-chamber and looked at the short figure under the covers, at the dead face with the mild features and white whiskers
he saw, he knew, he understood, no least particle more; he let himself sink deep in the pillows, quite blinded and exhausted by the morsel of truth which had been vouchsafed
have you pupils, master?
every compassion, every grace, every sparing, every last trace of consideration for the incredulous, im- ploring objection 'that you verily cannot do so unto a soul': it is done, it happens,
it is my duty to point out to your tender years the intellectual perils of intercourse with this man, and to beg you to keep your acquaintance with him within safe limits
now for-get the pain, it says
ten minutes later he came back, smiling, if rather pale, and with excuses on his lips for the disturbance
it is  the imitation of a theme composed backward instead of for-ward--a very, very difficult thing
yes, here it is, faust, valentine’s prayer
and a tiny, taper-decked tree burned likewise, it was said, in the rooms of the bedridden and moribund—each had his own
n one felt outraged over the dishonesty: they spoke of it as an act of folly, laughed a bit, and shrugged their shoulders
it possessed her altogether
that you will see, answered the consul
no threats were graven upon the bronze tablets, nor did those who came to petition fear the countenance of the judges he read in fear and trembling, read with design badly and disjointedly, purposely omitted some of the elisions that were marked with pencil in kilian's book, made mistakes in the lines, progressed with apparent difficulty, and constantly expected the master to discover the fraud and pounce upon him
well, all that young hans castorp found worth listening to; not precisely overwhelming, of a value largely experimental, but still worth listening to
one after another he mentally summoned up various people, the thought of whom might serve him as some sort of mental support
why she should call me young un i can’t imagine
and now, with hopeful hearts, we might rlrink together to the family health and to its future--that future when all the old and elderly of the present company would be laid to rest; and to the children, to whom the christmas feast most properly belonged
the deep-blue, star-shaped gentian and the autumn crocus, pale and poisonous, appeared again among the damp grass, and a reddish hue overspread the forests
what is there in it?
you were right to laugh at his ruthful tears - aside from the fact that whoever has, by nature, dealings with the tempter is always at variance with the feelings of people, al- ways tempted to laugh when they weep, and weep when they laugh
he stands there, within the aura of her personality as it sweeps past, idiotic with happiness at the encounter, and at the word which has been uttered by her mouth directly for his ear
more and morc, after the dilatation of the stomach had been cured without diminishing the headaches and nausea, he shifted his explanation of the symptoms to the brain, confirmed therein by the emphatic demand of the patient to be spared the light
it was only necessary that the delicate child should conceal his thin-skinned perceptions and assume an air of unconsciousness; when there was nothing to prevent his taking friendly advantage of naphta’s invitation
but she also - it came out by accident - knew pfeiffering; had secretly made acquaintance with the setting of adrian's activity, his immediate surroundings; had, if i am not mistaken, stood under the window of the abbot's cham- ber and gone away unseen
rudolf was always com- pliant
i will look on for a while, said he, brushing the wet from his coat
so hans castorp, when asked at table, might add a couple of tenths to his temperature, and could never help feeling flattered when they shook their fingers at him and called him an artful dodger
her room was next to tony's, divided only by cur tains from it
there was a natural fitness in the fact that after adrian joined us the landscape began to rise and the mountain scenery under snow, though still at some distance, to come into vie,v
we came to the rescue, we freed germany from the invader-- tony, chin in hand, stole a look at him and wondered for a moment if he could have actually helped to drive out napoleon
thus all waited silently for the consul
i have heard him say: the work of art?
before i forget it, julie would rejoin, would you like one of my apples?
he is bankrupt, she repeated
but what is politics for, then, if not to give both sides a chance to compromise themselves in turn?
of course he should have said nuremberg
on the flashing surface of the snow, shadows, so strong, so sharp and clearly outlined that they seemed almost more real than the objects themselves, fell from houses, trees, and telegraph-poles
but what sort of description is that of yourself—an ailing old man?
no, let us be serious, professore!
the tea stood steaming in the meissenware cups when thomas entered

the wind had been two days in the south, the sun bore down, the valley seemed shrunken, the side walls at its mouth looked near and bald

he unfortunately did not succeed in preserving his composure at the nai have and childish outpourings of his sister
i wanted to tell him about helene and of my proposed step, but his renlarks did not precisely en- courage me
what is the flesh?
lawyer paravant and the magnus couple were still in the hall, frau stöhr and the kleefeld in the salon
for human progress snatched up ever more peoples with it on its brilliant course; it conquered more and more territory in europe itself and was already pressing asia-wards
she looked him in the face
from them, or from one of them - he left me the choice -life had once, borne by cosmic projectiles or simply by radiation pressure, arrived upon our formerly sterile and innocent planet
well--er--i really could not repeat it to a lady
the inheritance is a matter of real importance for us
a gloomy, taciturn look came on his face
the fish-market, how-ever, was held around the fountain in the market-square it-self
i find it very serious
once a woman, perhaps
he had two desires: one of them, the stronger, was to be alone with his thoughts and his stock-taking projects; and this his balcony assured to him
the dance was beginning
after a while he asked: et toi—où as-tu été?
hans castorp recalled having heard similar sounds the evening before, though his weariness had prevented him from heeding them: a struggling, a panting and giggling, the offensive nature of which could not long remain hidden to the young man, try as he good-naturedly did to put a harmless construction on them
for instance, he ,vas always the last comer at a party, he had to feel himself waited for, other people must always wait for him
i am still young--do not you think i am still rather pretty?
but i warn you, castorp, if you are going to give way to your civilian feelings and set up a howl, i’ll simply show you the door
she busied herself about the room, summoned the malay to take the coffee-machine, then withdrew awhile, and on her return, softfooted, took part standing in the others’ talk
but her eyes, too thoughtful to close themselves, slowly followed the movements of a large insect with a long body, which perpetually besieged the glass with a million soundless motions of his wings
perhaps our hero himself was not quite comfortable either; though he refused to give himself any trouble to wrestle clear of vagueness and involution and arrive at certainty of how much time had gone over his head since he came up here
it did not come
self as descended from the german humanists of the time of the poets
also he occasionally mentioned social affairs, visits, dinners, balls
tony was resting in her room
i beg your pardon, hans castorp said, a hymn to the devil?
the way he put it, it sounded like shoving music off on me, as though it were more my affair than his
do not deny it--it would be sacrilege
he had seen them coming along the level path half-way up the slope; now they were stalking downhill directly towards him; he heard their voices
it was incomparably more so
your position in the matter is quite clear
this is nice clean work
'how' means 'what did you say?
a manifestation of the highest energy - not at all abstract, but without an object, energy in a void, in pure ether - where else in the universe does such a thing appear?
as he passed through the dark hall, he felt in his pocket for the letter
a gold chain, bequeathed him by his grandfather, now hung about his neck, with the family arms on a medallion at the end--a rather dismal design, showing on an irregularly hatched surface a flat stretch of marshy country with one solitary,
it was really more for decorum’s sake that she had tried to introduce a little sobriety into the mood of her son, not realizing that precisely the middle course, the golden mean, was impossible up here, and only a choice of extremes offered
there is so much to be done!
its quiet but modish cut was at once marked down by the cousins, whose worldly glances were met by their counterpart, only quicker and keener, from the little man’s own side
for, as you probably know, permaneder's right to my dos, is, legally speaking a property right
hans castorp threw off his covers, sprang up and strode to the corridor door and back
there is a trap door on to the roof from the attic
the few roads kept open were like tunnels, with towering walls of snow on either side, crystal and alabaster surfaces that were pleasant to look at, and on which the guests scribbled all sorts of messages, jokes and personalities
i should think that, as my brother, you could ostensibly take the place he had--that of confidential clerk
your remark is incomprehensible, settembrini answered him, which doesn’t prevent it from being at the same time silly
this had led to a crise de nerves, an outburst of despair on clarissa's part, which went to the mother's heart, and seiler had been asked to terminate the training and use his connections to get her a start as a beginner
others besides friends gathered round as well, curious on-lookers, who cut the rest-cure for the sake of the diversion thus afforded
hans castorp interrupted him again
little red spots appear on the breast and abdomen, about the size of a lentil
i must take my cure
in all these years, i have always longed to be out in the world again; it is so dull here in this house
indeed, he might cherish the thought that in making her his he would be raising and rehabilitating her
i do not see, my dear friend, why my presence--but no matter
music-stand, and the bas-reliefs of singing cupids over the doors
but how get at the confession?
it had a view of the ocean, which was the main thing

asked herr gr�, slowly stiffening
i-iere it often anunted to a rigidity, a more academic than artistic specu- lation in notes, a mosaic scarcely any longer effective musically, seeming rather more to be read than to be heard - and so on
at last they were settled
he had drawn up a chair for his sister beside himself, and slowly drank his tea and ate a biscuit as they talked
she had grown very old, and lived quite alone at the end
it was this very power, quiet yet compelling, that caused consul tienappel all unconsciously to gaze at his nephew; and now even open-mouthed, for he found his nasal passages obstructed, though, so far as he knew, he had no catarrh
here i am--and i have come with a heavy heart
frau permaneder loved these visits
i should say so, he answered
some- body once warned him in jest not to make some girl- or it might perhaps have been a married woman - unhappy, and he had actu- ally answered, arrogantly: oh, there are so many unhappy!
one sunday, as she sat in st mary's with her parents and brothers, pastor k�ng began preaching from the text about the wife leaving father and mother and cleaving only to her husband
after all, these acquirements were premature, they must have burdened his young system, in addi- tion to the preparations for his finals
naphta evidently meant to hold humanity fast to its old, irrational position in the face of established biological fact; meant to force it to remain at the stage of primitive religion, where death was a spectre surrounded by such mysterious terrors that the gaze of reason could not be focused upon it
and then, when i see her before me i always think: 'you are an old woman with a big daugh-ter, and your life is over

afterwards— afterwards, yes, gladly
he propped his head on his hand and read in his mythology bonk, munching mechanically the while, because that was proper to the day: marzipan, sweet-meats, almond cream, and plum-cake; until the chest-oppression caused by an over-loaded stomach mingled with the sweet excitation of the evening and gave him a feeling of pensive fnlicity
this was the beginning of september
the succession of postcards began with the joyous announcement that joachim was with the colours, and a description of the fanatical ceremony in which, as hans castorp ironically couched it in his reply, he had taken the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience
but in a boy's eyes, as i see it again in retrospect, most gay and glorious of all was the comprehensive display of percussion in- struments - just because the things that one had found under the christmas tree, the toys and dream-possessions of childhood, now turned up in this dignified grown-up display
he took up his wanderings again
i feel we understand each other, and now—to the point!
senator buddenbrook carried out his plans
that must be a military trait in my character, after all, if i may say so—
you see what kind of trouble i get into every minute—and me so anxious to go my own simple way, unspotted from the world
it was furnished as a reading- and writing-room, with oak panelling and a light, vaulted ceiling, bookcases, a centre table covered with newspapers in holders and surrounded with seats, and writing appurtenances arranged in the bay-windows
but why, wlen obviously there was no need to take pains?
the state of his health obliged him to give up his theological studies, after which he spent some years in a school belonging to the society, where he acted as prefect and preceptor of the younger pupils
and came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy
this music has simply nothing in common with the spirit of the sp'ring celebration, which after all was in a certain vay the preparation for it: i mean with the spirit of hum- ble glorification
hans castorp rejoined that it was probably all true; he and his cousin were naturally more or less prone to such dangers—it was the same old story about the delicate child of life, he understood perfectly
but the air helps us, helps us hear, if you understand what i mean, this thin, dry air up here
it is arsie-versie in the matter, for 'tis the brain which gapes at their visitation and looks forward expectantly, as you to mine, that it invites them to itself, draws them unto it, as though it could not bear at all to wait for them
reason is not the highest thing on earth
i pay every homage to reason, settembrini answered
what i’d like to say is—i mean, you said, herr hofrat, if i understood rightly, you said: in another relation
well, it’s like this: it cannot have escaped your acute apperceptions that there is something about your case that doesn’t hold water
the remark sounded final; but he was far from letting the subject drop
then they stood about, looking first at the pump and then at the director, their faces pictures of distress; and the director, meanwhile, had turned to dr goldener, who hurried up with a very red face and spoke to him in a deep hollow voice, fairly babbling with excitement between the words
oh, certainly--of course he will buy it
during its progress joachim entered, and sat down by the open balcony door; his cousin half reclined in his bed, with his head on one side, and his eyes swimming with pious enjoyment as he listened to the mounting harmonies, and bestowed a momentary metaphorical shoulder-shrug upon settembrini’s twaddle about music being politically suspect
you reached it after passing the hall, the garderobe, the kitchens and domestic offices; you could not miss the door, it had a porcelain shield
{noterich's craving to make himself heard pla)ting cello and snorting the ,vhile
interjected the frau consul, shocked
the consul quite approved of this, and argued that it displayed love of one's neighbour, a sense of human fellowship, and a lack of snobbishness
the day had come
this is naturally a thing to keep wry about, but after all not at the length - when the houre-glasse is set, the red sand has begun to run through the fine-fine neck - ah, but only just begun!
but frau schwarzkopf watched tony all the time, to see how much she admired the young man--and really, it was most interesting, he was so learned and so jolly, all at the same time
but admiration and sadness, admiration and doubt, is that not alrnost the definition of love?
when you lie here and look at it, from a distance, it makes you shudder
both of them, eh?
true, he had to pay for it: for full two days—that is to say, for the space of ten meal-times, madame chauchat never looked his way
but we must be clear on this point, \iatthaeus, said he, that the social ideal of an economic social organization comes from autonomous thinking in its nature enlightening, in short from a rationalism which is still by no means grasped by the mighty forces either above or below the rational
on the th of august  the news reached me in freising that that remnant of a life had been quenched: a life which had given to my own, in love and effort, pride and pain, its essential content
all this seemed to me so much be- neath his dignity that i wished he had told the truth rather than made the fiddler responsible for the idea; yet i could not quite suppress the question whether our pixy platonist might not have had a hand in the enterprise
naturally, in his case it was not the same kind, certainly not; he had what would have been called at home a feverish cold
herr gosch tried to lift his glass to his thin lips, put it back on the table again, cursing through his shut teeth, and struck the offending arm with his fist
it was his fatherly duty to occupy himself a little with the child: so, while the plates were changed, he would examine him and try to stimulate his sense for facts
that was young schwarzkopf, tony answered
on the other hand, if he were overtaken unawares by the storm, he would probably in any case not find his way home
her chin was so deeply buried in her hand that her four bent fingers clutched her under lip
the lame man took them up in the lift to their own storey
leo zink and he were on a cool, sometimes even ticklish footing; i have often noticed that charmers do not appreciate each other, a fact equally applica- ble to masculine and to feminine conquistadores
it was a sort of half-monthly thousand and one nights’ entertainment, spinning itself out at will, calculated, like the stories of scheherazade, to gratify the curiosity of a prince, and turn away his wrath
but the comparison has indisputable justice on its side
ru- dolf repeated his wooing, only this time not for adrian but him- self
for the molecule was composed of atoms, and the atom was nowhere near large enough even to be spoken of as extraordinarily small
it was not matter and it was not spirit, but something between the two, a phenomenon conveyed by matter, like the rainbow on the waterfall, and like the flame
he lived in the rambergstrasse, near the academy, as a lodger with the widow of a senator from bremen, named rodde, who with her two daughters occupied a ground-floor flat in a still new house
the frau consul looked toward the glass door and, still embracing her daughter, stretched out her hand to her grand-child, who stood there shyly with her finger to her mouth
i find your train of thought highly edifying, mynheer peeperkorn
the young man took the book in both hands and ran it quickly through, from cover to cover
this was the line he sometimes took
very well, answered justus kroger, sitting down again with a shrug of the shoulders
while he breakfasted below, hans castorp did the same above, his down quilt tucked behind his back, in enjoyment of the good appetite a change engenders
he cast about for means to refine upon the position
there were two curving prongs of bright steel, extremely sharp-pointed; a slightly spiral centre portion of gold-inlaid ivory, in which the prongs were somewhat movable and could sink up to a point; and a bulb of semi-hard black rubber
the whole company burst out laughing
for the sake of goodness and love, man shall let death have no sovereignty over his thoughts—and with this—i awake
we scarcely know how to explain why hans castorp, with all his native love of falling water, had never visited the picturesque cascade in the valley of the fluela
in other words, they are the humanistic callings, and if you go in for them you have to study the ancient languages by way of foundation, for the sake of formal training, as they say
but he did not know if such courtesies were practised up here; probably the established order was more powerful than the rules of chivalry
what you been doing up here?
hans castorp laughed, to hear his cousin speak thus, quite simply, without explanation
pieter peeperkorn lay grievously ill, the day after that evening of cards and champagne we have described—and no wonder
i must, must not i?
dh, you can leave that to me, she said, quite undismayed
himself by the unnatural correctness of his language, which he used in order to intimidate the master
the one saving grace was that he could rail at it
he is a born objector, i saw that at once, down on the existing order; and that always gives me the impression that the person is
by all means i am a humanist, because i am a friend of mankind, like prometheus, a lover of humanity and human nobility
or he would draw up a chair and sit down at the corner of the table, between hans castorp and the schoolmistress, or between hans castorp and miss robinson, and look on while they ate their pudding, which he seemed to have forgone
it changes its meaning; it abides as a light in t
adrian said that he found spengler intel- ligent and agreeable to talk to
and the consul puts his hand on the old man's shoulder and gives him a thaler
he could still hear old johann softly humming in the bed room
mon- signor hinterpfortner and i are certainly no longer alone in the trembling - and at the same time, god help us, secretly sustain- ing - realization
and when he stands there and talks, in his guttural dutch voice, there’s something unmistakably robust about him
her figure was full and well-proportioned, the impression she made both capable and rustically simple, as one saw her small work-hardened hands, the double widow's ring on the right one, poised on the firm strong hips, bound by their stiff apron-strings
he closed his burning eyes and groaned
but if he ,vas not there, that visitor - and i shudder at the admission which lies in the very words, seeming even conditionally and as a possibility to en- tertain his actuality - then it is horrible to think that those cyni- cisms too, those jeerings and jugglings, came out of the afflicted one's own soul
and herr consul does not take it ill of me, do'e, now?
and then he recited, appropriately and with effect, two of the prayers customary on such occasions
but notwithstanding all the importance he attached to the projected improvement, he jumped away from the theme and demanded that joachim tell him more about life up here and about the guests—which the latter straightway did, being only too pleased to be able to unbosom himself
cyanosis indicated abrupt stoppage, a violent apoplectic arrest of the vital functions
but you are right--what is there to say?
sometimes consul kroger or sesemi weichbrodt came too, with her simple sister
somebody must have some esprit, settembrini said, looking straight ahead, with a melancholy air
and finally there was thomas buddenbrook himself, as a somewhat younger man
i will tell you--it is too new
hand on his shoulder
is that worthy of a brother, you will permit me to ask?
no, naphta went on
they left behind their own accustomed valley, and the change of scene refreshed their spirits
every one wanted to revise the constitution and the franchise, and the citizens grumbled
the hair half covered the ears, and as i grew up it was slowly silvering; it was drawn tightly back, as smooth as glass, and the parting above the brow laid bare the whiteness of the skin beneath
she said, with her whole strength; and looked at them all with a challenge in her eyes
shrove tuesday came on apace; before one had actually seen it on the way, it arrived
it appeared that the stranger, who might be about settembrini’s age, was a housemate of his, the other tenant of lukaçek the ladies’ tailor
well, i will tell you
hanno and several others did the same
but--but--she saw him before her, saw his gold-yellow whiskers, his rosy, smiling face, the wart on his nose, his mincing walk
but i assert they are that the more, and the poly- phonic character of the chords is the more pronounced, the more dissonant it is
he declined to accept that brutal fatum et factum
if you feel any inclination to blub, kindly suppress it
had he enjoyed himself?
he desired to do so
it won’t do you gentlemen any harm, i take it
but now they stood with their mother about their father's death-bed, weeping; and a message was sent to meng street, though the feeling was not entirely wanting that their rich relations were somehow or other to blame for this misfortune too
he was tired of the cooking, he said; they all were, up here, and it was customary to grumble at the food
wait, i have it—it was avdotia
herr gr� had turned his gaze upon her
somebody has been flown away with—by the devil
once again she yielded, to gain a present peace, and was thereby more than ever in his power
this corre- sponded ,vith my own feeling
lie must have preserved it for a while and then in some moving to munich, to italy, to pfeiffering, it must have got lost
reason and magic, said he, may meet and become one in that which one calls wisdom, initiation; in belief in the stars, in   numoers
iwersen, the proprietor, a blond giant of a man, in a woollen jacket, was in the doorway with his wife
pastor wunderlich had not changed colour; he looked as pale, re-fined, and alert as ever, while drinking down glass after glass of wine
but kant has shown in the most forthright words that such a thesis cannot support itself be- fore the bar of reason
one word from thy sweet lips
thy life shah be cold, therefore thou shajt love no human being
you aren’t like a picture in a physiology-book, there’s a hitch here and there, and you haven’t cleaned up your gaffky, you’ve even gone up a peg or so, it’s six this time—but never mind, don’t pull a long face, you are better than you were when you came, i can hand it to you in writing
but what's a man good for, but to wear himself out?
do not say that, thomas
he had taken a small thermometer from a red leather, velvet-lined case on his table, and put the mercury-filled end under his tongue on the left side, so that the glass instrument stuck slantingly upwards out of his mouth
that villain learned in the law, to ,,,horn in a weak moment she had surrendered, used his single conquest to enforce her
mynheer peeperkorn had presided at only one evening festivity in all these weeks; and the group had taken but one short walk
the more secret they were, the more they required a third party, the intimate friend, the good man, to whom and with vvhom one could talk about them - and that was i i saw it and took my role upon myself
she was sometimes seized by attacks of panic and whimpering, caused by the lassitude which seemed to be constantly on the increase, or by her rising curve; when she would come sobbing to table, the chapped red cheeks streaming with tears, and wail into her handkerchief: behrens wanted to send her to bed, she would like to know what he had said behind her back was the matter with her, she wanted to look the truth in the face
what joachim had said about his cheeks was fully borne out; they were really purple, and set off his head garishly against the white surgeon’s coat he wore, a belted smock of more than kneelength, beneath which showed striped trousers and a pair of enormous feet in rather worn yellow laced boots
very good, very good
as for tony, the consul was gratified to see with what self-possession she defended her position in the town as a buddenbrook born; for as a divorced wife she had naturally to overcome all sorts of prejudice on the part of the other families
herr gr�, with measured tread, passed between morten and his mother and went out the door
it had been a gesture not only of deliberate, but also of natural and instinctive disdain; and that feeling was quite comprehensible to hans castorp
but the way it passed over the tiny intervening unmarked strokes showed that all the figures and divisions on its path were simply beneath it, that it moved on, and on— hans castorp shoved his product of the glashütte works back in his waistcoat pocket, and left time to take care of itself
she gave me a camphor injection, applied icecompresses and friction—and here i am, saved for humanity
there was a red-haired greek girl, another of unknown origin with a face like a tapir’s; the voracious lad with the thick eye-glasses, and another fifteen- or sixteen-year-old youth, with a monocle stuck in his eye, who carried his little finger, with its abnormally long nail shaped like a salt-spoon, to his mouth when he coughed, and was manifestly a first-class donkey—these, and numerous others
hans castorp ate heartily, though his appetite did not turn out quite so stout as he had thought
you are so eager—you are very ambitious—she continued thus to mock him, in her slightly veiled, pleasantly husky voice, with her quaint pronunciation, giving a foreign sound to the r and making the vowels too open, even accenting the word ambitious on the first syllable, with exotic effect; rummaging and peering the while in her leather bag, whence she fetched out, first a handkerchief, and then a little silver pencil, slender and fragile, a pretty trinket scarcely meant for use—the other, the first one, had been something more to take hold of
our readers will believe us that his antagonist insisted on giving him tit for tat, paying in the newest-minted coin, receiving in his turn another just as good; thus the conversation proceeded, on the lines laid down
the rest is just a pretty feeble play on words
he commanded them the more absolutely in that, so far as he knew, he had never sought the leadership, but was rather called to it against his intention and desire
i know, morten, she answered gently, looking away from him at the fine white sand sifting through the fingers of her free hand
then there was a quaint old model of a ship; and right at the bottom a rat-trap
to others, wind instruments, to still others strings a
as for herr gosch, he was not in the habit of sleeping in the daytime, he was glad enough to get a few hours' sleep at night
herr gr� now said good-bye and departed for hamburg
he narrated with colour and vividness
as for the old frau consul, she was quite prepared to think of the new house as a logical consequence of all the other blessings which had fallen to her lot, and to give thanks to god therefor, accordingly
here now is a third, of quite different mould, not only equalling in disinterestedness those other simpler souls, but even excelling thenl in the ascetic renunciation of any direct approach, the inviolable observance of his privacy, the aloofness, the restraint, the persistent invisi- bility
they had a sweet sound in the ears of the daughters of uncle gotthold
they fetched the patient at her humble lodging, in glorious, frosty-sunny weather, and escorted her through the english quarter, so named after the hotel d’angleterre, and along the main street, lined with luxurious shops
he thought his mother had, perhaps; the others did not seem to be aware
from him he gets the charcoal-burner’s faith in reason, freedom, human progress, the whole box of tricks belonging to the classicistic-humanistic virtue-ideology
you must go on alone now, she said
kenness; so giveth he his soul thereto and cometh among the carrion
natures like adrian's have not much soul
i have not asked what you would do in this or that case, but what you to-day, now, will do
how could anybody call them airs?
certainly, of course, james tienappel acquiesced, rather intimidated
from all quarters of the fatherland came long-haired, black-coated gentlemen, to enjoy the pious intercourse and the nourishing meals, and to be furnished with the sinews of their spiritual warfare
not a dressing-gown, for he never used one, even in the mornings, only when he got up in the night and sat an hour or two in his chair
hans castorp turned his attention to the preparations for taking joachim’s x-ray
but in that kingdom they know that he who tastes even once of its fruits belongs to them
undoubtedly, though only superficially, as herr settembrini, in his plastic way, had remarked, the comfort on board an ocean steamer did make one forget the element of risk in the circumstances
it was, take it all in all, a happy youth for tony
how angry i have been!
i think i’ll just have to present you, as briefly as possible
certainly, of course, hans castorp said
in the modern style of doing business, there is a thing they call usance
he pressed his lips on her brow
ience of religion - ideas both of which have somethi,ng provisional about them, for theology therewith prolonged its life
and yet, like all the simple, inevitable things, they soothe, they ronsole, after all
heaving a sigh, her eye-glass ribbon behind her ear, she had betaken herself thither, since such and only such was the prospect life held out to her
it fills it in and breaks it up, so that there’s something to it, something going on—to quote, with due and mournful piety, those casual phrases of our departed joachim, all echo of which so long ago died away
do we really grasp the meaning of the fact?
suits it to leave the ash long, i don’t knock it off more than a couple of times
but do not you think it's cruel to let me know that only out of in- humanity i am what i am and that humanity is not becoming to me?
and cherish with affection true
the natural instinct toward industry, common to all these good burghers, began to assert itself: they ventured to bargain a little, to pick up a little business here and there
tell me, engineer, he said, how have your family taken the news?
our consent, she repeated after a pause, sadly, and rather bitterly as well
i have heard of such things, mostly in hesse, where a few of the landed gentry are in the hands of the jews
she lived in the twilight of her curtained living-rooms, and dreaded the sun, the dust, the crowds of townsfolk in their holiday clothes, the smell of coffee, beer, and tobacco; and above everything else in the world she hated getting hot and upset
his little round eyes seemed to have sunk deeper in his head, his cheek-bones and his large aquiline nose stood out more prominently than ever, and the ash-blond hair seemed to have been just touched with a pdwder-puff where it parted on the temples
professor kumpf's good out-and-out ways with the devil were child's play compared to the psycho- logical actuality with which schleppfuss invested the destroyer, that personified falling-away from god
plastic themes in which the apocalyptic work abounds, rising to his mind, there at once to be checked and chilled, to be bridled and bitted and made to take its proper place in the thole structure?
he usually drank out of the little gold mug which uncle justus gave him
un- fortunately, my dears, such is the case
you’re going to hook it?
he said, and pressed his hand imploringly—and the latter noted that the excitement of the journey, the sleepless night, the emotion, made joachim’s head tremble on his neck, as his own did when he took stock—hans, he said earnestly, come down soon!
there are poor students enough
there were consul hagenström’s two sons, ages fourteen and twelve, two fine stout lads, strong and high-spirited, who organized real boxing matches in the woods outside of town, who were the best gymnasts in school, swam like seals, smoked cigarettes, and were ready for any kind of mischief
because as things stood with people up here, he thought, anyone who had the honor of being healthy didn’t count and wasn’t going to be asked any questions—and that annoyed young castorp
hans castorp made a personal inspection of the deceased
she was in despair over this savage burst of antagonism between the two nations to which she belonged, france and germany, and which she believed should complement one another, not brawl
from alphabet to syntax and grammar, from counting and the four arithmetic operations to calculating ratios and simple proportions, from memorizing little po�ms (there really was no memorizing; the verses were grasped and mastered immediately and with great precision) to putting into writing his own thoughts on topics of geography or local history-it was always the same: adrian cocked an ear, turned away, and assumed an air as if to say, yes, fine, that much is clear, enough, go on!
but, then again, i’m not that surprised, either, because i’ve never really felt all that splendidly healthy, and when i think of how both my parents died young—then where was such splendid health supposed to come from?
pribislav hippe no longer appeared living before him, as he had eleven months before
the young man kept one thumb wedged between the buttons of his jacket; he scowled, even puffed out his cheeks in defiance
or i did know it
herr grünlich strode with measured steps between morten and his mother and out the door
we’re home, settembrini said and for the cousins’ sake pointed with his cane to a little house before whose gate they had now halted
the sanatorium’s closer from here
it isn’t there and yet it is—and that makes for lifelikeness
he was clearly anxious to have it understood that humanity was not some idea discovered by freethinkers, their exclusive possession, but that it had always existed and that, for example, the acts of the inquisition had been inspired by the most touching humanity
had grünlich in fact been a nobody?
she looked so splendid, and although i have no notion of the finer points of violin playing, i do know that she was able to make her instrument (a genuine stradivarius) sing—indeed, it almost brought tears to one’s eyes
no one knew what thomas buddenbrook was thinking, no one was allowed to know—and that was what was so terribly difficult: keeping the rest of the world ignorant of his sorrow, his hate, his helplessness
if winter means darkness, snow, cold, warm radiators—then this is winter again, there’s no denying
he searched his pockets for a pencil, but could not find one, and neither joachim nor the teacher had one to lend him
but of course, he realized angrily, the real scandal is that the walls are so thin and that you can hear everything so clearly, and that’s simply intolerable!
you should marry someone from here and stay on forever
there was no trace now of the new and fresh spirit that thomas buddenbrook had once brought to the firm; and his partner, herr friedrich wilhelm marcus, whose invested capital was small and who therefore could never have exerted any significant influence, was by nature and temperament a man lacking in initiative
good lord, is this still just my first day?
he said softly, four years …
then the door slammed and the equipage rumbled off
for it is said: be sober, be vigilent!
but she hardly seemed to understand what he wanted—since, quite rightly, the idea would never have occurred to her that it might be more tactful to spare joachim and she was much too businesslike to think that anyone, and certainly not a close relative, could possibly indulge in self-deception as to the nature and outcome of the case
frau chauchat likewise indulged in filter-tipped cigarettes that she took from a russian enameled box decorated with a speeding troika, which she had laid within easy reach on the table; nor did peeperkorn scold his neighbor for yielding to the pleasure, though he did not smoke himself, never had
the upper class of this commercial and democratic city-state bequeaths its children the burden of higher civilization, and hans castorp bore it on his shoulders with a certain easy dignity
jist a tiny li’l deal, ma’am, with the walkmühle brewery
the question of where they would live was settled in an exchange of letters
i’ve had enough of it, christian said
do but recall the lusty temper of the folk among you in germany's midst, along the rhine and everywhere, in the excitation of high spirits and yet constrained enough, full of foreboding and ill at ease-the hot yearning for pilgrimage to the sacred blood in niklashausen in the valley of the tauber, children's crusades, and bleeding hosts, famine, insurrection, war, and pest in cologne, meteors, comets, and great signs, stigmatical nuns, crosses that appear upon men's garments, and now they hope to advance against the turks
one afternoon, after looking in vain for him in his room, i found him sitting at a little harmonium that stood in a neglected corner of a hallway in the living quarters
hans castorp wrenched himself out of his paralysis and quickly stepped forward once again
no doubt of it, that will rouse them for your spirit, that will win them to the faith
herr grünlich asked in a gentle voice, apparently what i am reading is not to your taste, fräulein?
they would chat about one thing or another, and the time until second breakfast, which joachim faithfully used for a rest cure, was so brief that even a downright dimwit or lamebrain could not have managed to be bored, whereas it gave hans castorp an opportunity to feast on his impressions of the first three weeks up here and to meditate on his current situation and what it perhaps might lead to—so that he had almost no use for the two thick illustrated magazines from the sanatorium library that lay on his nightstand
they all fell silent, smiled, and looked at him expectantly; here and there someone would add a nod of encouragement to his smile
what can i say, herr behrens?
and he left no doubt of his certainty that they all, without exception, labored and were heavy laden
the bridge of the nose was thin, its curve delicate; the cheeks above the beard were set back in the shadow of the cheekbones and seemed even a bit gaunt
oh, thomas, christian said, shaking his head very seriously and lifting an index finger rather ungracefully, as far as that goes, that’s something you can’t really understand
it would have been considered totally uncouth and cruel to mention to someone that he or she had been here for three years to the day—it was not done
in her dismay, tony stopped eating for a moment
it was agreed that joachim should be returned home, and the berghof took care of all arrangements necessary for the transport and whatever else seemed fitting and stately
but must afore all else, he continued, also excurse -he corrected himself and said, excuse, but then repeated, excurse-myself to you and beg you to take no offense that our hound praestigiar,
it’s all settled and arranged
the issue then was the incapacity of the husband to support his family,  right!
they’re coming here to threaten the council
and so, after the first interruption in adrian's cure, its continuation with dr zimbalist came to an end
and with her eyes gazing heavenward, she gave fervent expression to her honest emotions, and earnestly, slowly, weightily, she said, no, no, you all know how it is in life
he smiled as he addressed him, and once again hans castorp felt sobered at the sight of that delicate, mocking curl of the lip under the sweep of the black moustache
in short, no giving up!
but what’s that odor?
willaert, the founder of the venetian school
she hastily let go of her chin and looked him squarely in the eye
one need only recall, moreover, the, admittedly very infrequent, introduction of jazz sounds for purely infernal purposes-and i may then perhaps be pardoned my ironic use of the term streamlined for a work that, in its basic intellectual and psychological mood, has more to do with kaisersaschern than with a modern sleekness of attitude and whose nature i would prefer to call (to use a daring term) explosive antiquarianism
he hated this musical value, a term that he could associate with only one thing: chilly arrogance
she saw to it that he would never forget her; but he, who would never see her again, never forgot her for her own sake, either, and her name-the one he had given her from the beginninghaunts his work like a rune, legible to no one but me
all these ecstatic writings, proclaiming judgment, pedagogically fanning the fears of eternal punishment, and arising out of pre­
back already from pöppenrade?
he did it, as before, in the stern tone of a cross-examination, adding a scowl
oh, but of course you would have to go see for yourself, she said eagerly
this is the moment of crisis
to prove it to us, he exposed his aquarium to sunlight, while shading it on three sides; and behold, within a very short time the whole dubious crew-mushrooms, phallic polyps, tiny trees, and algae meadows, plus those half-formed limbs-bent toward the pane of glass through which the light was falling, pressing forward with such longing for warmth and joy that they literally clung to the pane and stuck fast there
honor to whom honor is due
but would you also like to go upstairs first, perhaps, and rest and refresh yourself a bit, and then come back down here to me?
and now we have a new phenomenon—about which the narrator would do well to express his own amazement, if only to prevent his readers from being all too amazed on their own
above all else, love of the fatherland and a boundless hunger for glory
to this date i have heard but one gewandhaus concert with schumann's third as piece de resistance
but that’s the problem, she continued, crossing her arms, laying her head to one side and tapping the floor crossly with her foot
there’s snow in january, but almost as much in may, and it can snow in august, too, as you’ve noticed
you are saving me the embarrassment
what about the truth, my dear sir, which is so intimately bound up with freedom, and its martyrs—whom you claim have slandered the earth, but who are instead the planet’s most beautiful and everlasting ornaments?
these gray gables were tradition, something old and trustworthy, and they had taken her back in, and here she would live again
one of his idiosyncrasies was that at such moments he was impervious to all objections
which brings us back to our previous question about his mediocrity or more-than-mediocrity, to which we do not wish to give a conclusive answer
there are indications that at one time the brotherhood of the lodge was symbolically sealed with blood
we are seriously concerned that the term may be misunderstood, be associated with undignified and outdated notions, with an obsolete model that in no way does justice to the reality we envision here, the product of untiring advances in musical technology, developed to elegant perfection
there are sailors with bare tattooed necks, their hands stuck in their wide, low trouser pockets; grain haulers with blouses and knee breeches of black glazed linen and faces expressing vast integrity; wagon drivers, who with whip in hand have climbed up on piles of grain sacks to wait out the election results; servant girls wearing scarves, aprons, heavy striped skirts, and little white caps perched at the backs of their heads and carrying large market baskets over their bare forearms; the women who sell fresh fish and vegetables, wearing their straw scoop-bonnets; even a few pretty farm girls with dutch caps, short skirts, and long, pleated white sleeves puffing out from their brightly embroidered blouses
should i have someone give you a special copy of the house rules?
and when his uncle asked him what he meant, the nephew replied, jargon
the same boy who brooded over arithmetic without any hope of ever understanding it, despite all his special tutoring at school, understood everything that herr pfühl said to him at the piano, understood it and made it his own—if you can be said to make your own what has always belonged to you
for she was an artist (as adrian had been informed beforehand by frau reiff), a designer for smaller opera and operetta stages in paris, for the gaite lyrique and the old theatre du trianon, who created and sketched the costumes and sets that served as models for tailors, carpenters, and painters
his side-whiskers had been freshly curled, and his face was especially pink this early in the morning
gerda, who had said goodbye to christian at the door, entered the room now, and her exotic, close-set brown eyes had taken on the enigmatic shimmer that music always seemed to leave behind
the reader can believe us when we say, however, that his opponent was man enough to respond with a brilliant comeback, which he then received in kind; and so it went for a while and the conversation flowed on into issues previously touched upon
i, for my part, was never able to attain such clarity, although it was clear to me that anyone who found himself in a situation where he must ponder such matters would have to assume certain precedents, or indeed predecessors—though i did know that director behrens, who as you are perhaps aware is an amateur painter in oils, had in the course of a great many sittings produced a magnificent portrait of her, with a lifelike mastery of the skin that, just between us, certainly takes one aback
i remember that both during the trip there and while we sat at dinner in the neatly kept hotel cater-corner
can you believe, for instance, that it was only very shortly before my marriage that i learned that the confederation’s laws concerning the universities and the press had been renewed?
my grandfather was half norwegian, and his name was morten
but just as the delicate strains died away something truly dreadful happened—it burst over them like an unexpected, fierce storm, overwhelmed them, paralyzed them
i am a thorough civilian myself, my cousin often reproaches me for it
how are you taking this?
what’s your opinion, tom?
tom and tony, who didn’t like fish and had been attentively following the adults’ conversation, called up to the head of the table in unison, oh yes, tell us about it, grandmama!
otherwise it is merely a pleasant banality, good for singing calm little songs down on the plains
that is what moves me, makes me love them so—the spirit and purpose, if i can put it that way, that lies at the basis of their being and allows them to live together like this
rebellio carnis is what the jesuits call it
yes, yes, he said, we both have been through a lot, tony
and then she revealed to him the whole story of babbit and what had occurred in the bedroom
and so it was that, after taking only a few steps down the path of life, he came to regard music as something extraordinarily serious, important, and profound
when he washed his neck and arms, his numbed hand simply let the sponge drop to the floor
but since, and quite rightly so, dr krokowski continued, one ought not conclude that the whole was itself a perversion simply because its parts were, one was therefore compelled to enlist the legitimacy of the whole, if not its whole legitimacy, and apply it to each of the perverse parts
en un mot, the fourberies gracieuses had to be closed again after a very short season, but the experiment had not proved unfruitful for me, either, since it had brought me into contact with the elite of parisian artistic life, with painters, musicians, poets, and in paris today-as i may surely note even here in this spot-there beats the pulse of the living world
because externally grünlich was a gentleman—to a tee
and in the next instant little johann stood up in bed and stammered something unintelligible; his odd, golden-brown eyes were wide open now, staring not at the real world all around, but at some totally different world inside him
which room have you chosen for our discussion?
for some distance, the darkness of the sea was illuminated by circling and darting will-o' -thewisps, by the luminous energy with which many of the fish came equipped, so that the entire body of some was phosphorescent, while others were at least furnished with an organ for light, an electric lantern, which they presumably used not only to light their own path through the eternal night, but also to lure prey or signal for love
he sat down and began to improvise
would take more of a man than i but i’d rather have a hearty snack than a whole day of tasteless air
for what were lost in the flames were the body’s more mutable components, which even in life were burned up in the body’s metabolism; but those components that participated least in life’s steady flow and that accompanied human beings through their adult life almost without change, proved to be the most fireproof; they formed the ashes, and by collecting them, the survivors kept what was immortal about the deceased
they dance and whirl and cheer
for children did arrive, and with what propriety, with what resolute, one would almost like to say, heroic denial of circumstances that were increasingly less favorable to bourgeois luxury, they were tended and reared-for a world, so to speak, as it had been, not as it would become
and then tony would reply, good lord, you’re forgetting yourself, sir!
his traveling companion ignored it, too, and greeted hans castorp, who had risen from his chair—though she did not extend him her hand, but simply smiled and gestured for him oh, but please to resume his seat and oh, but please not to let her interrupt his tête-à-tête with mynheer peeperkorn
finally she asked in a gentle but firm voice
i (keep mutinous silence)
he did not drink-always just lightly sweetened tea with no cream, although that three times a day, to be sure-did not smoke, or at most only on rare occasions and, then, quite free from any force of habit
by the beginning of april, joachim was a lieutenant
above the door was an ornate gilt inscription, just one shining word—quisisana—and the idyllic little cottage was known all over town by that name, which everyone pronounced with soft zs and very indistinct as
all such matters were not only foreign and of no significance to religion as such, but also inimical to it; for they were the constituents of life, or so-called health, which was to say, ultraphilistine, utter bourgeois existence—to which the religious world was ordained to be the absolute opposite, indeed the very genius of opposition
and his voice began to waver strangely
and with that farewell, which likewise sounded ghastly, since he pronounced it like d’gods, he would move on, heading for joachim’s balcony
in the course of our four semesters at halle, these were undertaken two or three times in corpore-that is, when baworinski put out a call mustering all seventy men
true, things were different then—the stories they heard now were from long ago, almost a century past; it was history, and from history, at least ancient history, they had learned in theory about the type of person presented here—a man of courage, uncompromising in his hatred of tyrants and consumed by the fire of liberty—though they had never thought they would come into such direct human contact with one
he was wearing his clinical smock—a stethoscope stuck up out of the breast pocket—embroidered slippers, and no collar
on both occasions, along with other pieces representative of this new intellectual music, works by leverkiihn-unfortunately in the absence of the composer-were performed before an audience that was by no means unreceptive, i might say, an audience whose artistic views were republican
they certainly would not call that making-do, they replied, and followed her through the solidly built house, looked into the family living room at the front, where the pungent odor of pipe smoke noticeable everywhere was most firmly entrenched; and then on to the abbot's study, an agreeable room, not so very large, somewhat older in architectural style than the exterior of the house, its character more that of i oo than i o-wainscoted, with uncarpeted plank floors and stamped leather covering the walls beneath the beamed ceiling, and with pictures of saints in the low-vaulted embrasure and on squares of painted glass fitted into some of the ring-leaded windowpanes; a wardrobe with iron hinges and locks stood against one wall, which also had a nook where a copper water kettle was hung above a copper sink
how strange the word sounded in schleppfuss's mouth!
but it is my sad duty to tell you that your husband has been obliged to stop all payments and is no longer able to carry on his business
but it is also possible to imagine creatures whose space requires time to move at a pace so monumental that in their experience our terms for describing intervals like just now and in a bit acquire the vastly expanded meaning of yesterday and tomorrow
no, he said, i am not equating them—you’re the muddlehead
what a coup, what a triumph!
oh, love is nothing if not foolish, something mad and forbidden, an adventure in evil
peter döhlmann will be there, of course; he’s never in town this time of the year; his business just trots along on its own like an old hound dog, i guess
a cavalier à la mode
good heavens, the sheets have to be hemmed
frau schweigestill, who was in fact farther away, was beside him more quickly than we who were closer, since, though i do not know why, we hesitated for a second to assist him
he was deeply wounded, perplexed at himself and not just himself; for the suspicion that had crept into his soul after the first mishap now
and yet most certainly not everything in breisacher's remarks was in order; one could easily have refuted him, pointing out to him, for example, that the spiritual disdain for animal sacrifice is first found not among the prophets, but in the pentateuch itself, where moses himself declares sacrifice to be patently secondary and puts all the emphasis on obedience to god, on keeping his commandments
i worry about so many things, and everything is so hard for me
at the entrance to front row people were sitting on their stoops and mending nets; barefoot children came running up, curious to have a peek into the carriage
herr ballerstedt swelled up, waved his limp fist, worked his lips, raised his eyebrows, and stared young heinricy straight in the eye
the director replied, much as he had—if we may remind the reader—when hans castorp had declared before his first examination that he had a little fever
it is like a painfully loving caress of the hair, the cheek-a silent, deep gaze into the eyes for one last time
but joachim was so insistent about cutting the party short that there had to be another, unspoken reason—one that hans castorp had come to understand only too well ever since he had realized the precise meaning of joachim’s blotchy pallor and the peculiar, woeful way he wrenched his mouth at certain moments
he would rather not drink beer today—wanted nothing at all, thanks, at most a little water
i beg you, please regard the delicate symbolism of his garb
he felt as if christian only told this story with such relish because it gave him an opportunity to scorn and ridicule work
the thursday family day was canceled
diminished, director behrens dictated
it had been the highpoint of his life
she watched him go, her face set in the same long-suffering pout with which she had greeted him
one ought not, my boy, leave to the suburbanite the final word as to what is sick and what is healthy
he turned his back to them
what has led man into darkness, and will continue to lead him ever deeper is unbiased’—that is, a philosophical—natural science
i am firmly resolved to do it
they took the bark of this tree, then ground it into a powder, mixed the powder with rasped coconut, rolled the mixture in a leaf, and roasted it
it’s madness to hold on to the house, it’s just dead capital—and it’s my job to know about such things, isn’t it?
as a matter of fact, the old gentleman had few good words for ida jungmann
there was no energy left to run or even increase his stride, and so he simply let his body fall forward in the hope that his legs would manage somehow not to trip him up, but would keep going on their own, stumbling and wobbling as best they could—and he arrived at the outer gate just as the bell stopped ringing
he accepted the temperature chart and looked it over while his patient quickly undressed above the waist and hung his garments on a clothes stand next to the door
wait until herr throta left and then go to gerda and speak his mind, have it out with her?
and since the real world, the valley populated by human beings, very quickly closed behind him again and was lost from sight, and since no sound could reach him from down there now, he was soon deep in his solitude before he even knew it, more deeply lost than he could ever have wished, so deep that the feeling verged on fear, which is the prerequisite of courage
i fear the presence of a tendency that threatens to become an indelible trait of character unless one opposes it head-on
i said that adrian returned to the spot to which an impudent porter had led him
still only in his mid-forties, that witty man had unfortunately succumbed to his heart trouble
then suddenly something happened—a soundless, terrifying something
mais c’est un sauvage!—where was i?
do you hear convention abandoned ?
grünlich approached me as a man with the best recommendations—a pastor’s son, a christian and urbane man
thoughts and images tumbled topsy-turvy in hans’s mental workshop
and then he pulls out his pince-nez (he always carries three of them, on long cords that dangle at his white vest and get all tangled up), sets it on his nose, which he wrinkles up tight, and stares at me pleased as punch, with his mouth wide open, so that i simply have to laugh at him
love of humankind, nothing more, and so it, too, was political, it, too, was a rebellion against everything that had soiled and degraded the ideal of humanity
and what does she say to me?
peeperkorn was sitting up in bed now and with a lightly trembling captain’s hand he would occasionally set the wineglass to his ragged lips and take great, thirsty gulps
in the corner, to the left of the sofa and chairs, was a work of art: a painted wooden sculpture set atop a large pedestal draped in red, a profoundly terrifying work, a naive pietà—very effective, almost grotesque
you wouldn’t believe it, madame permaneder, nor you, senator buddenbrook—but my house on sand strasse has grown utterly too small for us
it was precisely for such pronouncements that adrian had an especially sharp ear
it leveled everything out by means of abstraction, and since an orchestrated idea was frequently the idea in and of itself, its very substance, there was often hardly anything left of instrumental music when played on the piano
his thoughts were not his thoughts—just as he would never have taken the notion to fight a duel on his own, but had only adopted it from naphta, the little terrorist; they merely showed that he, too, was enveloped by the same inner state that had possession of them all—it had enslaved herr settembrini’s beautiful reason, had made it its tool
rudiger schildknapp, the translator, who was considerably older than we, probably in his early thirties, was, as noted, a member of the same circle; and since he was the only one with whom adrian was on closer terms, i too became better acquainted with him and spent many hours in the company of them both
for such qualities, my good man, people in the
something deep within him resisted the idea, and he knew how to avoid it
your temperature has nothing to do with it
two pages later, it read: i have had a policy written for my youngest daughter in the amount of  courant-thalers
but never mind, tom
between cries he would reach out his little hands to those around him and wail, help!
come by anytime you like, whenever you feel the need for a little colloquy
and now, two days after the pastor had departed for home, madame buddenbrook had, with visible hesitation, made a certain disclosure to her son
it certainly can’t be more than that
no, thank god, he saw no one
and now, do go in and savor your taking of nourishment
no, twenty-eight, hans castorp said
you have the conscience of the butcher’s dog, but you’re a loser, a dolt, a poor fool
the wild headlines from below now found their way directly to his balcony door, they sent the berghof into spasms, filled the dining hall with an odor of sulfur that constricted the chest, seeping even into the rooms of the bedridden and moribund
your guardian angel has been whispering in your ear
is apparently come back already, for i am no more alone: someone is there in the twilight, seated upon the horsehair couch that stands with table and chairs nearer the door, toward the room's middle, where we make our breakfast of a morning-sits in one corner of the couch, his legs crossed, but it is not sch, it is another, smaller than he, not so comely by far, and no true gentleman whatsoever
but it’s so dreadfully far away…
to the pedagogical temperament, that implies rebellion
but if we ascribe our keen awareness of this historical-psychological problem to our national honor and identify the striving for a new unifying order with our germanness, then we are well on our way to subscribing to a myth of dubious authenticity and indubitable arrogance-that is, to the nationalist myth, with its structural romanticizing of the warrior, which is nothing more than natural heathenism in christian trimmin�s, with christ designated 'lord of the heavenly hosts
does she know of your plans ?
sometimes even justus kröger and his family would appear, or sesame weichbrodt with her uneducated sister
that they, citizens who went about their business in seeming honesty and tried to know nothing, though at times the wind blew the stench of burned human flesh up their nosesdeclares that they share in the guilt for these horrors that are now laid bare and to which he forces them to direct their eyes
when the moral courage to decide and differentiate between fraud and reality begins to melt away, that marks the end of life itself, of formed opinions, of values, of any improving deed, and the corruptive process of moral skepticism begins its awful work
but i do think dietrich ratenkamp’s alliance with geelmaack was inevitable—fate simply took its course
he knew that his hometown, this town of ships and commerce, where highly respectable businessmen with incomparably principled faces strode along the sidewalks tapping their walking sticks, was no cradle of stainless morality
vesicular, he said, then once more, vesicular—that was good, evidently
we live on a very pretty square in the middle of town, with a well in the middle, just like on the marketplace at home, and our house is very close to the town hall
how charming—clear, bell-like, dainty tones floated up from the back of the room and filled the silence with a sweet, graceful, tender melody
in any case, she said in conclusion, offering her hand again with her customary heartfelt motion, i hope that we have not seen you for the last time
but the attack lasted no longer than a second
or better: the circumstances made preparations superfluous—that was the humiliating pan
but we had not yet come to that back then
over the years, the apartment grew more beautiful still, or at least more crowded and colorful, for dr lnstitoris
she hurried off, and her patron promptly received what he wanted
did i not explain it with the name kaisersaschern ?
the series of postcards had begun with the cheerful announcement that joachim had assumed his duties with all due fervent ceremony, during which, as hans castorp replied in his card, he presumably had sworn poverty, chastity, and obedience
to be sure, popóv might have choked to death on his mouthful of fish; but, in fact, he had not choked to death and despite all his unconscious cavorting rage had evidently quietly managed to keep from doing so
ah no, your great coup is already behind you
then and there, as a result of that rebuke, hans castorp had reached his decision, which he made known to the others, to pay his personal respects to their departed housemate and say a silent prayer beside his remains
friederike and henriette, the two older girls, had grown bonier and gaunter with the years, whereas pfiffi, the youngest at fifty-three, was much too short and fat
after helmut's departure we· spent a little time-as if he were still within earshot, so to speak-talking about unimportant matters
you do me great honor, and have paid me for my services for many a year now—and i am a man of modest circumstances
around noon, there was a good deal of traffic on breite strasse
i don’t know if you know the feeling
born in dresden, although his heritage lay more in the coastal lowlands, a blond of medium, trim stature, he had the polish and winning urbanity of saxon civilization and, being both genial and ever ready to please, was a zealous frequenter of salons, who spent every free evening attending at least one and more commonly two or three soirees, blissfully applying himself to flirting with the fair sex, from young girls to more mature women
and he repeated his injunction that there should be no strenuous concentration or forced visualization of their anticipated visitor—the only thing that helped was a casual, floating attentiveness
his head would lower until his chin lay on his chest, and he would hold that pose awhile—lost in thought perhaps or musing in a doze—half-asleep, before lifting his head for the next page
he certainly insisted on that difference and spoke of music as if of a foreign power, some marvelous phenomenon that did not, however, touch him personally, spoke of it from a critical and condescending distance-but speak about it he did and had all that much more to say, since it was during those years (the last one i spent with him at school and my first two semesters at university) that his musical experience, his knowledge of the world's musical literature expanded quickly, so that very soon indeed the gap between what he knew and what he could play lent a certain obviousness to that difference he was so emphatic about
what are we to do?
although everything can’t be just like before
he accepted others' devotion-!
frau permaneder was silent
in short, i am at the gentleman’s disposal
with herr grünlich skittering now ahead, now behind him and then pulling back the portieres, he strode across the dining room and into the sitting room
hans castorp’s long, pliant footwear bore him in all directions: along the slope on the left in the direction of clavadel or to the right on past frauenkirch and glaris, the shadowy ghost of the amselfluh massif looming up out of the fog behind them; he also skied the valley of the dischma and the hills rising behind the berghof, in the direction of the wooded seehorn, only the very tops of its two snow-clad peaks visible above the tree line, and toward the drusatscha woods, behind which he could see the pale, murky outline of the rhätikon chain buried under snow
madame chauchat was wearing a blue dress with a white lace collar
i saw one very young officer in full marching gear standing on the rear platform of a streetcar, looking back, obviously preoccupied with thoughts of his young life, staring off into space and deep inside himself-and he abruptly pulled himself together and with a quick smile checked all around to see if anyone had been watching him
it is my belief, by the way, not only that those who read me will, in time, come to understand my inner turmoil, but also that in the long run· it will not be foreign to them, either
but i’m glad that there are at least some other families that don’t have to kowtow to them, and that, for instance, we buddenbrooks …
you would not be sitting here acting like this if it were not quite excellent in comparison with my own
who would have thought it!
there is no miracle-worker, no mr individual creator behind it—it is an anonymous, communal work of art
i will be sensible—i already am
this, for example—and she pointed toward the breakfast table crowned with flowers from the garden—is fräulein jungmann’s handiwork
—had been, insofar as his illness and a stay up here of still quite indeterminate length had interfered with his plans; this was a critical time in his life, perhaps even a turning point, one could not know for sure
the tragic outcome was first, this ideal did not actually suit her personally, and second, the epoch itself, which changed and undermined everything, no longer permitted it
if a house is bought from an inheritance that is yours to begin with?
i am sixty years of age, having been born in ad ij, the eldest of four children, in kaisersaschern on the saale, district of merseburg, the same town in which leverkiihn also spent his school days-which means i can postpone a detailed characterization of them until the appropriate time
oh, clavdia, that is quite extraordinary
and thus am diligent, zelo virtutis, indeed almost overburdened and overbusied with matters, for am still hearing lectures of higher learning, history of philosophy from lautensack and both logic and encyclopaedic of philosophic science from the famous bermeter-vale
he would live there in the world of the flatlands, among people who had not the vaguest about how one had to live, about thermometers, about the art of wrapping oneself, about fur-lined sleeping bags, about three promenades a day, about—it was difficult to say, difficult to enumerate all the things people down there did not know about; but the notion that joachim, after having spent more than a year and a half up here, would now be living among such ignorant people, that notion, which applied only to joachim—and merely from a great distance and only quite hypothetically to himself—so confused hans castorp that he closed his eyes and dismissed it with a gesture of his hand
doltish-eyed hermine kleefeld shoved her way to her table, over near one of the doors opening onto the veranda, and greeted the thick-lipped lad who had hitched his jacket up so unbecomingly
for example, there were the gymnastic games that were supervised by herr fritsche, the physical-education teacher, and held out on castle yard once a week all through the summer—and there the town’s young males were given a chance to show and develop their courage, strength, agility, and reflexes
herr grünlich fidgeted nervously back and forth in his chair
let’s give you a few polite thumps
music grows wild, he said
but you do things in order to enrich yourselves
although she perhaps felt the grief of the consul’s death more than the others, after having been so close to him in recent years, and although she had twice shed bitter tears today at the thought of him, it was probably the prospect of a little family council, of an earnest little conference in which she would play a dignified role, that gave such a glow to her pretty cheeks, such liveliness to her eyes, such a sense of satisfaction and importance to her movements
i was first received by an elderly lady who serves as a social companion and with whom i was forced to speak french; but then gerda arrived and we chatted away, as we had the evening previous, for a good hour or more; except that this time we found ourselves drawn even closer to one another and strove to understand and know one another better
as a young man, hans castorp had learned the exhilarating thrill of brushing up against powers whose full embrace would destroy you
i have a tradition behind me
you are still young and will marry again
i had thought we would have breakfast up on schatzalp or wherever at least once
frau chauchat appeared at breakfast in a flowing open-sleeved lace peignoir, and stood there at attention—having first slammed the glass door—and charmingly presented herself, as it were, to the dining hall, before proceeding in her slinking gait to her table; and her attire suited her so splendidly that hans castorp’s neighbor, the teacher from königsberg, expressed her unequivocal enthusiasm
plainly, i am so cold
i’m sure he’d grab at the chance
in langensalza, had suffered from lung problems and was forced to spend a few months in a sanatorium in the harz mountains
i would never have confessed it to you if, as you put it in that old-fashioned poetic way, you had not opened the book of your heart to me
i would not say they disrupted it
hans castorp occasionally thought about the literary views that the man had offered on illness and despair—which he had found incomprehensible, or so at least he had pretended
he: sly cap !
to schwerdtfeger on adrian's account, who had expressed some wish about a zapfenstosser concert (it was a ticket for jeannette scheurl, i believe), to which schwerdtfeger had offered an objection or two
yes, my good sir
for people like myself, there is riothing about this monster that could lay claim to goodness, beauty, greatness; and i will never understand the happy cries of hosanna that the so-called works of god-the physics of the universe, that is-can evoke from certain temperaments
your eyes adjusted only slowly to the darkness and learned to make use of what light there was, which was augmented somewhat by the dancing flames in the fireplace
her face had something almost malaysian about it: slightly prominent cheekbones, narrow black eyes that shimmered gently, and a smooth lemony complexion that one would look far and wide to find anywhere
he was merely tired
work, time, and illusion are one, together falling victim to criticism
the portrait had no head, it was the skeleton of a human torso inside a foggy halo of flesh—the torso of a woman, he realized
it was a sultry august afternoon
as for your buttons, if i’m not mistaken, i haven’t mentioned a word about them
(the word comrade had made hans castorp feel rather uneasy)
if she would say yes, she could take her place in the world, set herself up quite nicely, which is what she really wants, and within a matter of days she would love her husband
the fellow with the choirmaster and the golden pot?
and it smelled a little like rotting seaweed
all he could see were dancing flakes, which seemed not to fall but simply to fill the air in a throng of dense eddies; the icy blasts singed his ears with sharp pain, took the strength from his legs, and numbed his hands, until he no longer knew if he was holding his poles or not
by prying them out with a lever
and where will i be once i am dead?
hans castorp waved this off
in its fundament it is merely a continuation of your extravagant existence
but that's an escapist attitude, came a final mutter
first, we really have nothing significant to say about the matter, because we have settled accounts with gosch, and it is up to him to do business as he pleases
and so it flattered my vanity all the more (i do not deny it) that a very lively demand for me to perform-though i had always played purely as an amateur-came from the much larger and more elegant circle of people whom the ambitious frau dr
and now i have to ask you something, tony said, after they had taken a few more steps—she had decided she must
i maintain, however, that the more voicelike and the more explicitly polyphonic the character of the chord, the more dissonant it is
if, hans castorp said, if i need it
the consul repeated, shaking his lowered head
but what about the pinions of eagles?
dazed and giddy, he quivered with exhilaration, just as he often did after a colloquy with naphta and settembrini, except this time the feeling was incomparably stronger—which may have been how he came to excuse his own inertia in fighting off such attacks of self-narcosis by reminiscing drunkenly about their discussions
granted, the destruction of our cities from the air has long since turned germany into an arena of war; and yet we find it inconceivable, impermissible, to think that germany could ever become such an arena in the true sense, and our propaganda has a curious way of warning the foe against incursion upon our soil, our sacred german soil, as if that would be some grisly atrocity
so tell me all
for my part i leave it to the reader whether such things deserve laughter or tears
joachim’s pose was growing more and more official
for did not a false primitivism-which was, once again, romanticism-lie close at hand?
all of which had so shattered his self-confidence that he now dared not look anyone in the eye
can you not abate this nuisance, this icy breeze ?
he asked them, first the dressmaker and then frau stöhr, how long they had been up here—the former had been a resident for five months, the latter for seven; he marshaled his english to ask his neighbor on the left what sort of tea that was she was drinking—rose-hip, he learned—and whether it tasted good, to which she responded almost stormily in the affirmative
well done, the director said
you maybe heard my name mentioned, ma’am, by your daughter
lebrecht kröger commanded, beside himself now
she hardly ate a thing
he’s an ass, of course, but at least he knows his latin
yes, thanks, i’ll just put it here against the leg of my chair—it’s fine there for the moment
for they valued his participation in theological and philosophical debates, to which, though without leading them, he would often give an interesting turn with just an interjected remark; and they especially enjoyed his musical talents, which were very useful, since he knew how to provide their
are his misfortunes the result of his own carelessness and dishonesty?
if you’d like, my son can walk you there
several gentlemen—senator möllendorpf, dr oeverdieck, consul kistenmaker, gosch the broker, c f köppen, herr marcus from the office, and captains kloot and klötermann—have all asked me to send their greetings
there are so many different tortures, castorp, and if a man is subjected to one torture, all he wants is for it to end, that is his one and only goal
johann, he said in a high, pleasant voice, without extending a hand to his brother, how is he?
his position in the matter is really quite clear
among whose adherents one may include fenelon, who taught that every act is flawed, since the will to act is an affront to god, who alone can will to act
did he not love her from out of his world of oratorios, with its musical theology and mathematics of magic numbers ?
he was already smoking his second cigarette
but it all centered around the curious equation of worth and sensual passion, around the fixed and strangely euphoric notion that inner worth could only be fulfilled, could only be realized in desire, which evidently was equal in seriousness to
i am beginning to surmise that you liked him as well
you had to pay close attention to keep from accidentally breaking a leg
but before the honeymoon was over, she had been struck a blow so unforeseen, so startling, so incomprehensible that it had robbed her of every joy in life
hans, he said, and in desperate anguish he squeezed his cousin’s hand, and the latter noticed joachim’s head trembling from lack of sleep and the excitement of the trip, just as his own did when he played king
(dedicated to my friend otto grautoff)
they wanted goods to be produced on the basis of need and loathed the idea of mass production
it was the longed-for release
notwithstanding a good many painful experiences in life, her body was unbent and her eye was still clear
technology and comfort-having those, people speak of culture, but do not have it
he occasionally mentioned social events as well—visits, banquets, balls
he watched the merchants in yellow mackintoshes, like the one he himself was wearing, as they streamed at noon toward the exchange, where things could get quite fierce, as he well knew, and someone might very suddenly be motivated to hand out invitations to a grand dinner, in hopes of prolonging his credit
in reality—that is, in any sense beyond this secret connection with her—he could not possibly have anything to do with a strange woman who lived her life at various resorts, separated from her husband and yet never wearing a wedding ring, who had bad posture, slammed doors behind her, rolled her bread into little pills, and doubtless chewed her fingernails; deep chasms separated her existence from his, and he could never have defended her against criticisms that he himself acknowledged
yes, that was his way of doing things
thank you, ida, that helps
he would be bold himself, he declared, perhaps even stick his foot in it, by declaring that in such a treatment of the fugue one could see hatred and violation, a thoroughly unaccommodating and problematical relationship with the artform, a reflection of the relationship, or lack thereof, between the great man and one still greater-at least in the opinion of many-johann sebastian bach
marusya’s laugh, however, the sight of her round, brown eyes, blinking childishly out over the handkerchief with which she covered her mouth, and her full, prominent chest—said to be more than a little ill on the inside—reminded him of something else that had shaken him when he had noticed it recently, and so without turning his head, he glanced cautiously toward joachim
this is where i arrived, he said superfluously
the firm’s capital, however, had been lying fallow for years
julie hagenström asked, her bright black eyes sending a sharp glance over to where morten was sitting and watching the elegant swimming party, his face betraying a certain melancholy
the students sank into their seats
it found itself one day given the designation of an independent form of life by an era that speaks of the century of the child and has invented the emancipation of women, a very indulgent era in generaland youth eagerly agreed to it, of course
he had laid his round head to one side, and his guileless eyes sparkled in their little slits as he listened to everything frau grünlich said
his hands in his trouser pockets, director behrens rolled back and forth between the balls of his feet and his heels, regarding his work along with his visitors
that was neither fish nor flesh
he thought it implied a general weak-willed slovenliness, and in that sense, then, a boundless guazzabuglio of tolerance
ah, but despite the comfort it offered, his tasteful interpretation was untenable; one did not believe it for long
lebrecht kröger, cavalier à la mode, was a large, distinguished man
he was bathed spotless as a baby, and he had his clothes made by a tailor who enjoyed the trust of the young men in his circle
and repeated whatever the time of day if he or someone else was leaving, the pendant to the 'nuff!
it was, instead, a rather reckless and unpolished variation of this folly, a fusion of frost and heat, like a man in a fever or an october day in these lofty regions
did not the simple fact that he had been transferred to the bad russian table express a certain carelessness about his person?
i bear within me the seed, the rudiments, the possibility of life’s capacities and endeavors
i ’spect it’ll be hagenström
he was himself more than a little ill; but without any affectation, he could say he was more inclined to be ashamed of the fact
he will fight the hectic fever with frequent baths, into which the patient is to be placed up to his neck every three hours, without exception, night and day, and during which cold water is to be slowly added at the foot of the tub
very remarkable,  i said
a woman, a rather pleasant lady in fact, though she did live alone and her eyebrows were a bit too regular, who had approached their table in a restaurant in munich, where they had spent a day between trains, came over to say hello to joachim
a marriage of love, people were forced to conclude, for although they admitted that gerda’s three hundred thousand had played a role, they knew it was merely secondary
so what do you say, wouldn’t you like to dance?
go on with what you were saying!
they had reached the second floor, when hans castorp suddenly stopped in his tracks, mesmerized by a perfectly ghastly noise he heard coming from beyond a dogleg in the hall—not a loud noise, but so decidedly repulsive that hans castorp grimaced and stared wide-eyed at his cousin
at early breakfast, each guest found a nosegay of violets beside his place setting; at second breakfast, a dyed egg; and at the festive dinner, a little chocolate rabbit decorated with sugar
courage, do you hear?
all these costumes had been hastily improvised after the meal
in the immeasurable expanses of time, you see how life moves onward and upward from infusoria to man, and you cannot deny that infinite possibilities for further perfection still await humankind
well, then, he continued, turning on his finest charm, our warmest thanks—gerda’s, too—for all your efforts, my dear
frau chauchat sat in the first row, but disappeared at intermission, so that from that point on hans castorp could listen to the music (and it was music, despite the circumstances) with a peaceful heart, reading the text printed in the program as each song was sung
first and foremost: there’s the air up here
so it’s both anonymous and communal, hans castorp said
she quickly threw her brother a look of gratitude, because he had seen her distress and now came to her rescue by inquiring whether the gentlemen would care to take a tour of the house
that was odd,fräulein kleefeld remarked
and yet soft traces of the sun’s farewell linger beyond and above
how much he must have changed under my very eyes for that to have been the case!
enough, the consul concluded
was it any wonder, then, that hans castorp, given his civilian sense of responsibility and interest in playing king, felt that he and joachim were obliged to pay him a little visit?
and hans castorp divulged his sad, but for all that, spiffing news
in all these years, i have longed for nothing else but to get back into the thick of life, because i am bored here with mother—god strike me if that’s a sin, but i’m barely thirty and i still feel young
she suddenly appeared before him as he lay on his balcony, and her exotic manners made considerable demands on the good breeding of that helpless, cylindrically wrapped gentleman
it had sounded so strange there in this lonely, remote place, that fare thee well and much obliged, like words in a dream brushing past hans castorp’s senses, numbed by climbing and singing
get up, grünlich, she said, sobbing
it took little or nothing to do it—and then came this: the realization that i couldn’t depend on permaneder even in that regard
questions that had been touched on in lectures and discussed in seminars, he skirted every conversation that might have gone to the root of the matter and addressed theology's problematical place among the sciences and so avoided exactly what, to my somewhat anxious mind, should have preceded all else
we had almost forgotten that our audience does not know her, whereas the name is quite familiar to us
a congflick, i tell you, ’nd i know something about what that means
she looked up imploringly at dr langhals
opening off this room lay bedrooms, rather spacious if likewise simply appointed, a third now being opened for us guests
but one cannot survive with just james joyce, picasso, ezra pound, and the duchess de clermont-tonnere in the audience
you know very well, as do these young gentlemen, that the human progress of which i speak is conceived as infinite
after first flipping a switch that turned on both lamps that gave off reddish light and then flipping another that doused the white ceiling light, dr krokowski took his seat under the chandelier, there where the arch of chairs came to an end
late evening, after the social gathering, when the crowd had left, was his best time
i would like some tea
she cried, and her bonnet shook with delight
at one time lay brothers used to live in them, but now they were almost always empty and were not really fixed up to be livable
what you must understand is that it’s your indifference that torments me
he spent his quiet evenings at home with gerda, smoking and listening to her play the violin or reading a book aloud with her—german, french, or russian stories that she had picked out
but in terms of lighting and heating, of bright, spacious classrooms, cozy teachers’ lounges, and well-equipped, efficient lecture halls and labs for chemistry, physics, and drawing, it represented the latest in modern comfort
why are they so happy?
it had a narrow tuniclike collar and side pockets, and a cross was dangling farther down
no peak, no ridge was visible; it was a misty nothing toward which hans castorp pushed his way
the mountains reached out on all sides, beginning with wooded foothills that ran down into the sea, then rising in a semicircle from a midpoint in the distance to where he was, and extending on behind him
he was a man with straight-hanging, unkempt, ash-blond hair and a beardless face with agreeable features: very prominent cheekbones; a hooked, slightly
his days and part of his nights were filled with operationes spirituales, with examinations of conscience, with introspection, deliberation, and meditation, and he went about it with such malicious, peevish passion that he found himself ensnared in a thousand difficulties, contradictions, and disputes
the diversion lasted several weeks

it would be good if we could fend off your catarrh somehow—there are the methods practiced in the flatlands
but i ain’t gonna leave good ol’ munich
although the barometer has fallen a little, the sky is still shamelessly blue, which looks wonderful with all the flags—and the whole town is full of flags—but it will be dreadfully hot
but at last destiny overtook her and brought all her sneering to a woeful end; woeful i said, because the man who conquered her virginity was in no way worthy of his victory, was not regarded worthy of it even by clarissa herself: a skirt-chaser with a pseudo-demonic goatee, a backstage johnny and provincial roue, a criminal defense lawyer from pforzheim, who came equipped for his conquest with nothing but a cheap, cynical gift of gab, fine linens, and a great deal of black hair on his hands
gerda, gerda, what is it?
within three or four months after his father died, he had forgotten death; now he remembered it, and all the impressions from before reemerged simultaneously—in every precise, piercing, and incomparable detail
before the fact of life's efficacy, my good man, all distinction of disease and health is undone
could anyone, anywhere, know what happiness that was?
and she complains constantly about her temperature, and that she’s so listless, and unfortunately it’s probably a rather serious case
he had such a good-natured, mischievous laugh, and when he had asked for water by using a couple of letters with some numbers added, his father had been simply furious
under each of the dried plants in his herbarium, he wrote in a fine calligraphic hand the latin names humanistic science had gallantly bestowed upon them, plus a list of their distinguishing characteristics
the only person in town who showed any understanding for his taste in literature was herr gosch the broker; his father was most stern in his condemnation of it
every afternoon, having finished his official duties, the schoolteacher-a rather young and delicate man, who never stopped being

friend there in the abbot's study, though i must admit that had i done so, it would not have been the same
i did not like him
and although johann buddenbrook was forever complaining in typical businessman’s fashion, all the losses had been balanced out over the past fifteen years by a profit of some , thalers courant
on the contrary, it was best to diffuse one’s attention somewhat, even quiet conversation was useful
that such souls are ladies, indeed maiden ladies, can come as no surprise; for human abstinence is surely the source of prophetic intuition, which is no less valuable for its stunted origins
i am, as you see, a little impatient in matters intellectual and would prefer to be denounced as a pedant rather than to leave uncontested views i consider to be as deserving of refutation as those that you have formulated here
more toxic than we gave you credit for, my friend, he declared
yes, yes, i see it, he said several times
what fun it was on a lovely easter morning to search for eggs and marzipan rabbits in the krögers’ vast gardens
yes, and it was really quite sweet of armgard to remember me after all these years since we were friends at boarding school and invite me
he knew that people in town were openly talking about the same thought that tony was blissfully turning over in her mind
holger had given his word, and they had no right to doubt he would keep it
as in so many things, there was a meeting here-of poison and beauty, poison and sorcery, but of sorcery and liturgy as well
you should see her teeth when she laughs
we’ll go to meng strasse later
water seeped, trickled, dribbled everywhere—it dripped, then gushed in the forests
it would be disingenuous to speak of mourning, but all the same, for a while the expression in hans castorp’s eyes was more pensive than usual
he would suddenly grow uneasy, get up from his work in the office, and walk in the garden alone; stopping every now and then as if something were blocking his path or holding him back, he would sigh and cover his eyes with his hand
no, my good man, that is no devil's ware
also at that time, he loved more than ever having riidiger schildknapp around-him of the same-colored eyes
dear friend, he said, apparently no one has been waiting for me to declare it, but this is a perfect piece of music!
and by the by, i don’t keep this thing just for fun, he said, noticing that the effect was wearing off
he had sat down in an armchair beside the table and was waiting
you will do what you think best, my dear, but first stop and think whether it might not be wise to preserve some social decorum
he said yes, he reported, and felt embarrassed
and hans castorp saw exactly what he should have expected to see, but which no man was ever intended to see and which he himself had never presumed he would be able to see: he saw his own grave
not unlike the pastor's, ah, you sweet tyke, you blessed thing!
well, then, professor, it’s quite understandable why herr settembrini doesn’t like to recall the blossoming of his order
on the ground floor was a restaurant, above it was a piano warehouse, and a portion of the third floor was occupied by quarters leased by the doctor, whose name caught one's eye downstairs on a porcelain sign beside the main entrance
from that point on, tony’s letters never lost a sense of hopelessness, which sometimes would even break into lament
after all, it was the novel conclusions reached during those evenings, together with my participation in adrian's lonely work, that produced the mental strain under which i lived at the time, and that indeed caused me to lose a good fourteen pounds
probably, he answered with a smile that showed he had been prepared for this objection
and then he did something that was to become a habit with him: he scowled, pursed his lips, stared up and away to one side, and then violently tossed his head around and stared in exactly the opposite direction
not even attempting to disguise his purpose, he found it easy to appeal to herr albin’s sense of chivalry, though he did ask that it be kept secret as a matter of personal honor
frau grünlich was wearing a cream-colored dress with a satin scarf tied at the chin, and despite a short night’s rest she looked splendid
and if you are, how can you say such bad things about the body?
her fiancé was with her, an english naval officer, but he didn’t exactly keep a stiff upper lip
he was still standing there observing, perplexed and lost in thought, when the director happened by

tony endured the remark in silence—it was no use, tom was quicker than she
why, all of dorf and platz, too, knew the nature of his relationship with frau wurmbrandt from vienna, the general consul’s wife—one could hardly call it clandestine anymore
what has to be done?
people were glad to see snow cover the valley, because that sight—and only that sight, since falling temperatures accomplished nothing—moved management to turn on the heat, at first only in the dining hall, but then in the rooms as well, so that when you unwrapped yourself from your blankets at the end of a rest cure and came back into the room from the balcony, your moist, numb hands could feel warmth stirring in the radiator, even if the dry heat only made your cheeks burn all the more
it gives you a certain—wait, a word has just come to mind that i have never used before—it gives you a certain genius
unfortunately they did not agree with him, and he told about two little henry clays he had taken a liking to one evening at a party and how they had come close to putting him six feet under
an ignominious ending will always be more normal, something quite other than the divine judgment that hangs over us at present, just as it once descended upon sodom and gomorrah-a judgment that we did not, after all, call down upon ourselves that first time
what awful posture she had!
the child would then suffer less and ultimately not at all
his head propped in his hands, count mölln went on reading about roderick usher, and hanno sat quietly watching the show
think of those shared impressions
but enough of that
because they tasted disgusting
wherever he went, he drew circles and made calculations, filled vast quantities of paper with figures, letters, numbers, and algebraic symbols; his tanned face, the face of an obviously unwell man, bore the visionary and mulish look of the monomaniac
fraulein scheurl's undisguised amusement at this defeat of attempted familiarity did not affect him at all
and the very next day she knew the name
do you know with what a thrill of amusement such felicitous errors fill me?
fräulein clementine, his mother’s new lady’s maid, a skinny girl with a curl in the middle of her forehead, a pointed nose, and nearsighted eyes, was already up and setting out breakfast
all the better, she says, half out of stupidity, half out of impudence, now she won’t need her castanets, heaven itself is sending her music to dance by and so—la la la la!

you should know that colds are not reçus here

study of the score discloses that the subtlest knowledge of the stringquartet form has been put to good use

what an effort it would be for her to spare me if she had to say no
articulation is supplied to the whole by very clearly contrasting tempi, although the movements are to be played without interruption
and so he stepped on ahead, pulling a gasping and generally reluctant joachim with him, and by the time they reached the point where the path leveled out and turned off to the right, they had almost pulled even with frau chauchat
let me overstate my case: my distaste for music is political
never will i offer my hand to that abomination
but before long she became used to the sum her brother had named—because all her thoughts and plans were occupied with her future
assez, christian, we are not the least bit interested, elisabeth buddenbrook said
and then she cleared her throat
from the very beginning, his hands had definitely been buddenbrook hands: broad, a little short, but with delicate fingers; and his nose was definitely that of his father and great-grandfather, though it appeared the nostrils would flair somewhat more softly
and it was then that adrian indulged himself in the joke of telling me in the most graphic detail how he and mr capercailzie had climbed into a spherical diving bell, measuring only four feet in interior diameter and fitted out much like a stratospheric balloon, and together had been dropped from a crane on the convoy ship into seas that were of monstrous depth here
your statement is incoherent, my good engineer, settembrini said in reply, yet its reprehensibility still shines through
not with her immortal soul, oh no, but with her upper lip, her full head of hair, her pretty eyes, and her fine figure
he did not like it, in fact, and every time it reappeared he found it embarrassing, as if it were some testy personal or nationalistic prejudice—not to mention the reaction of joachim ziemssen, who would refuse to listen whenever the italian started down that road, would scowl and look away, sometimes diverting the conversation or reminding them that the duties of the rest cure called

now and then she also made quaint, and totally untalented, attempts at speaking the dialect of bavaria
trying desperately to pull himself away, he slipped and fell against the column at his back
trembling in all of its beams!
moreover, quite apart from the concrete and specific debasement of physical pain or afflictions of the heart, life itself, in and of itself, mere existence, animal survival, is an unworthy and ponderous chain, a vile encumbrance, and anything but noble and proud; it is an exercise of our human rights and a legitimate spiritual act to thrust aside this burden, so to speak, to be rid of it, and to gain freedom, lightness, bodiless well-being, as it were, by supplying one's physical nature with this blessed stuff, which grants the body emancipation from suffering
had anyone ever said anything about it at school or in church?
a few people were still listening comfortably, but one also saw a good many
career’—what a lovely word!
papa can drive a person to tears, tony said, choosing strong words as was her habit
given the kind of life lawyer settembrini had led and all his extensive activities, he could not have been a great scholar of the law, or so hans castorp thought

these entries began with an extensive genealogy, tracing the family’s main line—how at the end of the sixteenth century the oldest known buddenbrook had lived in parchim and his son had become an alderman in grabau
it turned into a two-day migraine, which except perhaps in its severity was no different from earlier attacks
the consul did not dare to ask how close a call it was
then he made himself comfortable, pulling on his house shoes and a tuniclike jacket, picked up a chart and a pencil from the table, plus a book of russian grammar—he was learning russian because, as he said, he hoped it would be of use in his career—and thus equipped, he stretched out on the balcony lounge chair, tossing the camel-hair blanket lightly over his feet
thoughtful, meaningful copying is indeed as intense and timeconsuming an endeavor as putting one's own thoughts to paper (at least it is for me; but monsignor hinterpfortner likewise agrees with me on this); and just as at earlier points the reader may have underestimated the number of days and weeks that i have devoted to my late friend's life story, so, too, his notion of the point in time at which i am

beside himself now, the senator leaned against the wrought-iron grate of the cold stove and pressed both clasped hands to his brow
by its reception he may have grown a bit cannier, more given to the intellect and would mayhap not read so gladly the diary of goncourt or his abbe galiani had he not the connexion to higher things, had he not his secret memorandum
those had indeed been two spectacularly different grandfathers!
but he was willing to let himself be influenced, in the sense that it was pleasant to experiment, and so he reined in the protests that piety and good taste would have raised against the settembrinian order of things and decided that what seemed blasphemous to him might be termed bold and what he found in bad taste might, at least in those days and under those conditions, be considered the excesses of a high-minded and noble nature—as, for example, when grandfather settembrini called barricades the people’s throne or declared it necessary to consecrate the citizen’s pike on the altar of humanity
and now, stalwart friends, be so kind as to join me in emptying a glass of this pleasant nectar with good wishes for the prosperity of our most honored hosts in their new and splendid home—to the buddenbrook family, both present and absent

my son is much better than i with dates of that sort
fear had her babbling pure nonsense as she took the stairs to the third floor and rushed down the hall
official channels were used to bring about the impatiently awaited discussion with director behrens; hans castorp commissioned the bath attendant to pass the request on to the head nurse; this resulted in consul tienappel’s being given an opportunity to make that eccentric lady’s acquaintance

the father provincial himself summoned naphta at the end of his two-year novitiate, spoke with him, and approved his admission to the order

we were just calling you, the senator replied calmly
he looked up into her kirghiz eyes
all fine and good
a stranger was coming up the path on their left, a delicate man with brown hair and a black moustache twirled at the ends; he was wearing pastel checked trousers and exchanged a good-morning with joachim as he came up to them—his greeting was precise and melodious
but what was humanism?
and he pointed with one massive forefinger at his own two bloodshot, watery, protruding blue eyes
his work was done
the duchamps, the consul explained, my late mother’s family
the book opened a sardonic rift between truth and power, truth and life, truth and community
as composed and restrained as the almost invisible hairnet holding her hair in place, as detached and energetic as the people of her native land were known to be, she took charge of joachim’s care, was spurred on to maternal battle by what she saw, and was firm in her faith that if anything could be done, it would be done thanks only to her energy and vigilance

or maybe that’s why i was suddenly so interested in him
as long as she had been sure that herr grünlich was at a safe distance, she had actually enjoyed the earnest exchanges with her parents and the sudden importance attached to herself and her decision
the senator came with his wife and child, and while he and gerda silently shared their amusement at tony’s blissful hauteur, he had all he could do to prevent his sister from gorging her adored little hanno with dried currants and port
the table had been cleared; diederich schwarzkopf was sitting there comfortably squinting into the sun, his jacket wide open to reveal his shimmering vest, he and his son had lit their stubby wooden pipes, and tom was occupied with his cigarettes—and now the young men found themselves engaged in lively reminiscences of their school days, even tony joined in with enthusiasm
the pained, ragged lips were slightly open
hans castorp’s gesture implied that he seconded the delay peeperkorn had proposed
i could not give him much hope for tonight, but in a weak voice he asserted that it was his duty to try, threw on a coat, and hurried out of the apartment
and if they had beheld him all alone at night, bundled in furs, riding through his mountains in his golden sleigh, lit by torch light and escorted by outriders, those peasants would not have seen in him a madman, but a king after their own rude, but dream-stricken hearts, and if he had succeeded in swimming across the lake, as had evidently been his intention, the farmers on the far shore would have defended him with pitchforks and flails against doctors and politicians
'tis a right pleasurable meeting indeed, was the little boy's quaint reply
she was looking forward to the moment when tom would appear and she would greet him with a dignified nod
and now they were on the main road, which was set one terrace-level above the valley floor
although i certainly hope you don’t think i’m not glad to spend time with all of you, papa—that would be the worst ingratitude, i’d deserve to be horsewhipped
and in considering that inner aspect, he also thought of settembrini, the pedagogic organ-grinder, whose father had come into the world in greece and who explained love for that sublime image to be a matter of politics, rebellion, and eloquence, whereby the citizen’s pike was consecrated on the altar of humanity; he thought, too, of comrade krokowski and what the two of them had been doing in his darkened suite for some time now, thought of the two sides of analysis and how it was not only beneficial to action and progress, but also a relative of the grave and its foul anatomy
in short, i could not take any more—i bolted
medical journals and reference books (an illustrated history of morals for example) were to be found in the room where adrian waited on that first and, again, on a second occasion

kai flung open a window, then swiped adolf todtenhaupt’s rewritten notes and hurriedly started to copy the section that had to be shown the teacher today
he sat up erect on the sofa, crossed his legs, took a puff on his cigar, and, squinching his eyes a little, began marshaling the figures with exceptional proficiency
natural flow that was not there originally, and so is not natural at all, but rather a product of art-in short, it is only after the fact and as a mediator that this manager creates an impression of immediacy and organic wholeness

sometimes he sat down up on the little terrace, inside the pavilion, under the shade of its covering grapevines, and, without seeing anything, he would look out across the garden to the red-brick rear wall of his house
dr grabow felt the boy’s pulse; his face seemed to have grown even longer and milder
it is interesting, it is even good-simply because it is what is coming, and to recognize that fact is both achievement and enjoyment enough

if he then continued to play, pursuing some fixed idea, transforming and loosely shaping it, someone from among those standing aroundshort probst, maybe, a seminarian type with greasy, longish blond hair-might ask:
the unforgivable sin lies in—
in that regard father beissel was quite authentic
and when hans castorp objected that he assumed a lowered room temperature was part of the regimen for the cure and presumably a way of keeping the patients from getting too spoiled, settembrini responded with fierce scorn
you are trying to get to me by way of my humanistic honor i said

it’s almost like someone delirious with fever, isn’t it?
her aging face, with its pale mediterranean complexion and large, careworn mouth turned down at one corner, reminded hans castorp of a picture he had once seen of a famous tragedian; and it was eerie to watch how this pale woman dressed in black matched her long, somber strides, apparently without realizing it, to the rhythm of march music in the distance
jeannette scheurl happened to be in zurich at the time and even encountered adrian in the private home where he and schwerdtfeger were guest lodgers

he had resumed the mode of life adapted in his first three weeks—the familiar, regular, and perfectly ordered life at joachim’s side; everything went like clockwork from the first day, as if there had never been an interruption
yes, the meals in the dining hall with its seven tables held the greatest fascination for hans castorp
the gondola's windows, had been the mad grotesqueries, organic nature's secret faces: predatory mouths, shameless teeth, telescopic eyes; paper nautiluses, hatchetfish with goggles aimed upward, heteropods, and sea butterflies up to six feet long
nonsense, by july he was hale and hearty again, for several weeks, until a major physical suddenly loomed up ahead—ordered because of the cursed fluctuations in his temperature
and frau permaneder replied with three shouts: you see, you see, you see!
they considered the peasant and the craftsman honorable people, but not the merchant or the industrialist
i know you are not intentionally saying cruel things to me
the host sat at the head of the table, drinking heartily of a nonalcoholic beverage from an exquisitely cut glass and-face rigid as always-joked with the municipal theater's dramatic soprano beside him, a powerful woman who in the course of the evening thumped her bosom a great deal with a balled fist
he did what he could, didn’t even go to his tavern for two or three nights—god forbid
; and matthiesen, a tall grain hauler in a black jacket and knee breeches, white stockings, and buckled shoes, would even doff his homely top hat respectfully as he passed
there was a lady who sat at his table, frau stöhr was her name, and quite ill by the way, the wife of a musician from cannstatt—and she was the most illiterate person he had ever met

i want to tell you something
this portentous term is perhaps explained in part by the fact that frau else at once pronounced the man waiting for us to be a crazy hootowl

perhaps the old man was thinking about how he had sat beside the bed of a dying wife that first time, forty-six years before, and perhaps he compared the savage despair that had blazed within him then with the pensive melancholy that showed in his eyes now as he gazed, an old man himself, at the altered, expressionless, and terrifyingly indifferent face of this old woman, who had brought him neither great happiness nor great pain, but who had stood beside him with such clever, good grace over these many long years, and whose life was also now ebbing away
senator gieseke told them that kassbaum hadn’t lost his sense of humor
and she sighed with her half a lung, shaking her head and directing her doltish, sleepy eyes at the ceiling
inez imagined all sorts of things about him, the wrong things, and that created a skewed relationship, as if such a relationship was not already skewed enough on its own, given the foolish situations that were constantly cropping up and the caution it demanded in more ways than one
all the same, he had not waited for the concerts
at that moment her decision was irrevocably fixed for good and all
and how often adrian, with his thirst for the comic, would later laugh with me at this tale and at how his father would raise gentle, deep eyes from the book to tell it, and then, apparently quite undisturbed by the somewhat scandalous provenance of his holy writ, return to herr von schweinitz's verse commentaries or the wisdom of solomon to the tyrants
tom opposed this arrangement, but to no avail
well, he did hope, hans castorp said, that collars and cuffs were more in evidence with him than with her fellow countrymen at the bad russian table
tempers cool, minds clear, certain moods do not remain unaltered with the passage of time
he wrote me at length about it and also spoke about the modernity of musical methods that had erupted with monteverdi-about his images of action, his punctuated rhythms, sudden reversals of emphasis, stirring figures; about the way he had strengthened the musical line by parallels in thirds and sixths and varied his cadences rhythmically; about his crescendi, tightly woven imitations, widened intervals, thrilling grand pauses, insistent ostinati, and rhythmic repetitions
would it have taken much for the works of the hero of these pages, of adrian leverkiihn, also to have fallen victim to their lust for trampling under the things of the mind-a lust quite foreign to so-called mob rule?
and hanno buddenbrook slept, his cheek nestled in his pillow
every accented syllable in a text, then, would always have to be represented by a master and the unaccented ones by a servant
one day frau permaneder’s sister-in-law greeted her with the news that several repairmen and suppliers of household goods had been pressing her, gerda buddenbrook, in the most improper fashion, to settle some large accounts—and tony stood there frozen in place for a while before breaking into dreadful laughter
it’s an ache, a constant, faint, unsettling ache along the whole leg, and up my left side, the side where the heart is
that was all i needed
and it made her feel quite calm and serene
the splendid vocal organ swelled to its full natural range and power, and indeed if you walked into an adjoining room, leaving the doors open but staying out of the line of sight, it was exactly as if the artist were physically present, as if he were standing there in the salon singing, music in hand
once-unfortunately only once-during our stay, he sat down at the badly out-of-tune square piano in our friends' living room and played for us characteristic passages and a few entire scene sequences from the completed score (which included even most of the instrumentation for a select orchestra) of the pleasant, conceited comedic called, loues labors lost,  as the piece had been titled in r : the first act, including the scene set in armado's house, and parts of several later ones that he had worked ahead on-especially berowne's monologues, on which he had always had designs, both the one in verse at the end of the third act and the rhythmically unstructured one in the fourth, which was musically more successful than the former in expressing that lord's unremittingly comic and grotesque and yet genuine and profound despair over his having fallen for the suspect black beauty­
settembrini hissed in her direction
you are speaking of a unity that we are working to achieve, but which, to the great sorrow of all good men, does not yet exist
what are you going to do?
it was a decision that raised my heart high with joy-and at the same time compressed it with fear
a cold cigar butt was wedged between his lips, and his cheeks were flushed
it did not distort his features or diminish him as a man, and its very incomprehensibility—and no one would have had the impudence to attribute it to the quantities of wine he had enjoyed—lent him something grand and majestic, so that they all deferred to him and did not attempt another bite of food
madame buddenbrook said, her pale eyes drifting off a little to one side
the one person, however, who worshipped thomas buddenbrook’s fiancée with a fierce passion from the first moment he saw her on the street was gosch the broker
it was probably just a part of grandeur
this was his native soil—marshy, soggy, unsteady footing for all, though he trod it with more steady assurance
ultimately they all knew this before they sat down, and in his chatterbox way, hans castorp had even blurted it out as they waited with trembling fingers
the tarnished giant cylinder of the bass drum was here, whose head was set booming by a felt-covered mallet; and the copper kettledrum, sixteen of which berlioz still required for his orchestra-he had not known them in the form nikolaus leverkiihn stocked, with a tuning mechanism that allows the drummer to adjust for a change in key with a twist of the hand
across the way people were hard at work on the bobsled run—from the top of the northwest slope of schatzalp to the valley below—and it was expected to be open within a few days; that was, if a warm foehn wind did not spoil everything

we shall do a portrait of your interior here shortly
the care of his teeth—the fillings and extractions, if those were needed—was in the hands of herr brecht on mühlen strasse, the owner of josephus; but for the care and regulation of his digestion, there was castor oil—good thick, silvery, shiny castor oil, which was administered with a teaspoon and slid down your throat like a slimy newt
it is pure chance how i look, or rather, comes about thus, it stablishes itself as circumstance demands, without that i give it any heed
worthy townsfolk-and their contemplative mood enjoys the protection of halberdiers
those who had been here a year or more did not mention them
two people were being buried alive; their lungs full of the gases of the crypt, cramped with hunger, they would perish together, or even worse, one after the other; and then decay would do its unspeakable work on their bodies, until two skeletons lay there under those vaults, each indifferent and insensitive to whether it lay there alone or with another set of bones
he began the variations movement, the adagio malta semplice e cantabile
he let a few ivory game markers run through his fingers; they clattered into the chest, and he closed the lid again as he turned to leave

that same evening, as they stood alone in the sitting room by the dim light of candles burning low now among furniture shoved this way and that—and enveloped in the sweet, heavy, thick odor of fine foods, perfumes, wines, coffee, cigars, and flowers that had adorned both the ladies and the tables—the consul squeezed her hands and said, well done, gerda

with a volume on embryology propped at the bottom of his sternum, our young adventurer followed the development of the organism from the moment when the sperm, out in front of many just like itself and driven onward by the whipping motion of its tail, crashed headfirst into the gelatin coating of the egg and bored its way through to what is called the mount of conception, a conical protrusion in the outer rim of the egg’s protoplasm formed in reaction to the approach of the sperm
doesn’t he care about her at all?
she saw morten schwarzkopf—he was so real, and he spoke to her, bending forward in that special way of his, now and then turning his kind, probing eyes to gaze at someone else; he smiled, and wasn’t even aware of how beautiful his teeth were
they loved to put the existential question, spoke of sacral space or political space or academic space, of structural principle, of dialectic tension, of ontological correspondences, and so forth
the day was much like the one before—cold, hazy, windy
there it is a mere adjunct to homophonic composition
but not a totally detoxified heaven on earth, and there’s scant blessing in that—but the escape artist wouldn’t believe old man behrens

with the aid of sesame’s bishop’s punch, tony quickly became acquainted with them all
he found it similar in many ways to life at the shore: a primal monotony was common to both landscapes
and now herr grünlich stood up, too
do not believe, beloved brethren and sisters, that for the promission and establishment of the pact i had required a crossway in the wood and many circles and gross conjuration, for indeed st thomas already teaches that for apostasy there be no need of words by which to complish invocation, but rather any deed suffices, e'en without express obeisance
it is sure to look quite innocent
and hanno would sit there in a limp cold sweat, unable to protest, unable to run away—in a state no different from that of a felon facing execution—and with enormous eyes he would watch herr brecht approach, his forceps held against his sleeve, and he could see the little beads of sweat on the dentist’s brow and that his mouth, too, was twisted in pain
that thursday at the buddenbrooks, with the consul present, there was only brief, almost indifferent mention made of the forthcoming election, and even at those remarks old madame buddenbrook would discreetly avert her pale eyes

like his father and grandfather, like his relatives and friends, he would spend his days sitting at a desk and enjoying a fine, rich meal four times a day
and so having been invited for dinner as a good friend of the institorises, i was happy to comply when inez, seconded by her husband, asked me during the meal to keep her company afterward, once helmut had left, as planned, to play cards at the allotria club

and yet his drunkenness did not belittle or demean him, caused him no disgrace, but rather, when joined with the majesty of his nature, it only made him grander and more awe-inspiring
a family has to be united, to hold together, father; otherwise evil will come knocking at the door
a skilled expert at all this, in his element in more than one sense, hans castorp stood piously beside the bed
my good engineer, settembrini said, angrily admonishing him, pull yourself together and leave me out of such depraved nonsense

for me it would be deserting the colors to do what he did, to go down to the flatlands at all costs, despite rhadamanthus’s prohibition, and try to be of use and serve progress
having come here on a definite practical mission—that is, for the express purpose of having an energetic look around, of checking up on his lackadaisical young relative, as he put it, of prying him loose and taking him home—he was quite aware that he was operating on foreign soil; and from the first moment, he had been acutely sensitive to a suspicion that he was now the guest of a world, a social community, with a self-assurance as intact as that of the world from which he came, indeed surpassing it in that regard, so that his business energies were at once in conflict with his good breeding—in very serious conflict, because the self-assurance of the world of his hosts turned out to be truly overwhelming
aesthetic deliverance or confinement, that is destiny, that is what determines one's happiness or unhappiness, whether one is comfortably at home on this earth or lives in hopeless, if proud isolation
it is one o’clock in the afternoon and people are thronged along breite strasse in front of the town hall—the town hall, with its tracework of glazed tiles, its tapering towers and turrets silhouetted against the whitish gray sky, its covered staircase supported by projecting columns, its arcades whose pointed arches reveal a view of the market square and its fountain

he lived, we suddenly heard, with only one-quite competently, so it appeared, and the ladies soon forgot all about it

which he did, urging her on in pithy phrases
rather, her awakened femininity immediately turned to another, for whom she had long been conscious of only serene, half-sisterly feelings, but for whom quite different emotions were now freed within her
even though his shoddy exterior was excused by a tiresome lack of money and could not detract from his status as a gentleman and cavalier, which as nature's truth shone through and counteracted appearances, that same truth was partly a deception, and in this complicated sense schildknapp was an imposter
edward the seventh will no longer be able to allow the russians an exit through the dardanelles; and if austria manages somehow to pull herself together for a more active policy in the balkans, then
but just as those miscreants willed it, germany has been so razed to the ground that one does not even dare hope that germany will be able anytime soon to engage in any sort of cultural activity, in the printing of a book; and indeed i have now and then considered ways and means for having these pages reach america, so that for now at least they could be presented to people there in english translation
i’ve spent, god knows, sleepless nights coming up with it
fine, hans castorp said
sister, it was evident that the nature of her successes was more personal, or better, more erotic than artistic

he had taken a room on the fourth floor of a house on amalien strasse, not far from where his friend lived, and there he now sat at his desk, wrapped in a coat and blanket, beside an open window all winter long-for by nature he had an exceptional need of fresh airand consumed in part by hatred, in part by passionate addiction, encompassed by difficulties, and puffing away at cigarettes, he struggled for the precise german equivalent of english words, phrases, and rhythms
ontogenetically speaking, it has the same origin as the apparatus for the so-called higher sensory organs up there in your skull

shaving had become difficult for him, and although he had a heavy beard that grew rapidly, nothing had been done about it for eight or ten days, so that his waxen face with its gentle eyes was now framed by a full black beard—a warrior’s beard, the kind a soldier might grow out in the field

why should i start up here, of all places?
come here, tom, frau permaneder said, her voice shaking
because, then, even being demeaned brings with it a certain stature, and a woman can look down from the heights of her demeaned position to those who have no royal stature, and speak in that disparaging tone you used just now when you asked about timbres-poste and said: gentlemen should at least be punctual and dependable

he directed the young man toward the end of the semicircle nearest the chaise longue and folding screen, where elly had taken a seat on an ordinary cane chair, her face turned more to the entrance with its two steps than to the middle of the room; the doctor then sat down on a similar chair directly in front of her and grasped her hands, at the same time holding both her knees clamped between his own
nonetheless our attention was directed mostly to scenes outside, despite marie's having steered the conversation to shared experiences in zurich, to the evening in the tonhalle and the violin concerto
there can be no discoursing with teeth clattering
does your mind not take warm comfort in the thought?
naturally the dialectical connection between evil and what is good and sacred played a significant role in theodicy, the vindication of god in light of evil's presence in the world, which took up a large part of schleppfuss's course

in art, in any case, the subjective and objective are intertwined beyond recognition; each proceeds from the other and assumes the character of the other, the subjective takes shape as the objective and is awakened to spontaneity again by genius- wouldynamized,  as we say-and all of a sudden is speaking the language of subjectivity
well-tanned young people of both sexes entered humming a tune, spoke with the dining attendants, and weighed into breakfast with a robust appetite

he said it softly and without looking up, because dr mantelsack had asked him—and was given a nod of approval
interrupted only by a quick second breakfast with his mother and by dinner with gerda, after which he might spend a half-hour on the sofa with a cigar and a newspaper, he kept busy at his work until well into the evening—if not his firm’s affairs, then customs, taxes, railroads, new construction, the post, the care of the poor

because, as soon as he began to think of the end of life as something more than a distant, theoretical, and minor necessity and regarded it, instead, as imminent and tangible, as something for which one must make immediate preparations, he began to brood, to search himself, to examine how things stood between him and death and what he thought about matters beyond this earthly life
two half-naked old women were busy at a ghastly chore among flickering braziers—their hair was gray and matted, their drooping witches’ breasts had tits long as fingers

the dreadful bombardment of the city of durer and willibald pirckheimer was no longer some distant event; and as the last judgment fell upon munich as well, i sat here in my study, turning ashen, shaking like the walls, doors, and windowpanes of my house-and writing this account of a man's life with a trembling hand

you puff out your cheeks in amazement at my apologia, but i am the one who has every right to be astonished and not to understand how you in particular

oh—and tom, she began, first gazing down into her lap and then making a shy attempt to read his face, what about the furniture?
we’ll ride into town together later
she quietly laid aside her little handbag, her cape, and her gray cap, which she wore over her white one, and went to work, full of gentle and friendly words, her rosary dangling from her belt and clicking softly as she moved about

i have already mentioned the cloister garden above the town, to which our friends, portfolios in hand, climbed every morning to work, each in his separate spot
eva is very sweet to me, and herr niederpaur, the brewery director, is an easygoing man
it was easy to picture her life to this point
the dilemma begins, sir, the real tragedy begins where nature has been cruel enough to break the harmony of the personality—or to make it impossible from the very start—by joining a noble and life-affirming mind to a body unfit for life
my god, i don’t know how i got off that stage
whenever he spotted him, hans castorp was glad both that it was so difficult to come into contact with people who were not tablemates and that his hometown was a large one with many different social spheres
that’s my wife’s handiwork

the vegetable lady, for instance, in her big straw bonnet with bright green ribbons, driving her little cart on the way from the village, would call out a friendly, and a good mornin’ to you, missy!
hans castorp knew her vaguely by sight

he waved a dining attendant over—it was the dwarf—and although she was very busy, she instantly obeyed his forceful gesture and took a position next to his chair, milk jug and coffeepot still in hand
presumably it was more an attempt at affability---'born of extreme arrogance
and so he sank back down on his knees, his face and hands raised toward a heaven darkened by sulfurous fumes, but no longer the grotto ceiling in a sinful mountain of delight
over the centuries, the church’s love of innovation had consisted of inquisitions, whose task was to throttle all life-affirming ideas, to suffocate them in the smoke of the stake; but nowadays she was sending out her emissaries to announce that she was all for upending things, that her goal was to replace freedom, education, and democracy with dictatorship of the mob and barbarism
a few, here and there, may have understood and been touched by the shyness, the loneliness that enfolded him, by the lofty rigor of his life-indeed, i know that it did occur, and find the fact revealing
monkey, little merry fellow,
(he pronounced it iffamy, however)
it brought tears to my eyes
but i think you’ve probably got enough to do for right now just getting settled in, and don’t need any adventures
he pulled his book back in front of him, opened it, all the while visibly struggling to regain his composure by looking around the room; he now lowered his head and found his train of thought again
death or life—illness or health—spirit or nature
an unutterable collapse-economic, political, moral, and spiritual-in short, an allembracing collapse looms ahead
there had been fierce, involuntary manifestations of energy much like those that had occurred in hermine kleefeld’s room; at such meetings, comrade krokowski would use his skill to hypnotize little elly, putting her into a waking trance, and then, under all possible safeguards of authenticity, systematically obtain and cultivate phenomena: the turning on and off of lights, hangings on tables and walls, and much, much more
written in three movements, it has no key signature, even though, if i may put it this way, three tonalities are built into it: b minor, c minor, and d minor-of which the musician can see that the d minor forms a kind of dominant of the second degree, the b minor a subdominant, and with the c minor exactly in between
and when the ghastly procedure was over—and hanno would spit blood in the blue bowl at his side and then sit up pale and trembling, with tears in his eyes and his face contorted with pain—herr brecht would have to sit down somewhere to dry his brow and drink a little water

the song meant a great deal to him, a whole world—a world that he evidently must have loved, or otherwise he would not have been so infatuated with the image that represented it
hans castorp was inspired by this meeting, and at the same time he sensed something like a growing anxiety, much like that suffocating feeling of being locked up in a box together with auspicious chance; what was more, the fact that the long-forgotten pribislav had reappeared up here as frau chauchat and had looked at him with kirghiz eyes made him feel as if he were locked up together with something inevitable and inescapable—an inescapability that both cheered and alarmed him
hans castorp replied that the director had taken the words right out of his mouth, had suggested precisely what he had wanted to ask
whereas herr settembrini really did help me employ my time meaningfully
hans castorp looked up from his bed at his guest, whom he had reduced to silence
the devil waxes pathetical

and so, although we were always separated from one another in time, each melodic present kept delightful company with all the others, and what we produced formed a charming weft, an ensemble sound, that simultaneous singing could never form-a structure whose vocal pattern we happily enjoyed without inquiring further about its nature and cause

i don’t know, tom said, with exaggerated indifference in his voice, trying not to be impatient
but that billionaire's spree, that bombastic misery, finally came to an end one day; an expression of reason returned to the grimacing countenance of our economic life; and we germans had some inkling, it seemed, of an age of psychological recovery, of social progress in peace and freedom, of mature and forward-looking cultural endeavor, of a well-intentioned accommodation of our emotions and thoughts to what the world considers normal
then very close to hans castorp’s ear, she whispered a fervent yes!
the old man cried
suso, suso, he said, without raising his voice, but in a certain surprised tone of admonishment, and behold: presumably as a result of the soothing, buzzing sound, the animal calmed down almost immediately and let the wizard stretch out a hand and pat his old battle-scarred skull-and there was deep seriousness in those yellow eyes gazing up at him
he was already busy settling his affairs
you have made the best of your abilities
he also told them about the arctic circle, to which business had taken him on several occasions, about the midnight sun and the perpetual winter at north cape
and i go down there with permaneder, who takes my dowry and retires
madame buddenbrook was already dressed in the silk dress in which she was to be laid out upstairs in the columned hall later that afternoon
frau iwersen held back at the door, staring across the room to the bier
it was after supper, during the evening social, out in the lobby
and things will work out for you, too
they walked along in that wide, peaceful, whispering hush of the sea that gives every sound, near or far, some mysterious importance
his accent, particularly his it’s, betrayed his hamburg origins, whereas starting back in his student days, his cousin had adopted more standard pronunciation
finally he turned around and said with measured puzzlement, why, i know that face, don’t i?
it was brilliant-a proficiency that was fit for a cabaret performance, almost more impressive than his violin playing, and for which he must have innately been especially favored
human suffering goes to his heart
they strolled along the beach, right next to the water, where it is easy to walk because the sand is smooth and hard after high tide, where little ordinary white shells are scattered about, and the other kind, too—larger and longer, iridescent—and here and there you find wet yellow-green seaweed with berries like hollow balls that pop when you squeeze them, and jellyfish, the simple translucent kind, and the reddish yellow poisonous ones that sting you on the legs when you’re swimming
ma è matto questo ragazzo!
should have done it long ago
in response to my laughing disagreement, he admitted that kierkegaard must therefore have had little respect for our opus r  , and that on the whole the man uttered a great deal of aesthetic nonsense
i admit, you and the lord are on intimate terms
their guide, the estate administrator himself, had told them, with many a sympathetic shake of his head, as if these were facts worth knowing, that the inhabitants ate meat only once a year at christmas and did not even have tallow candles to burn, but literally went to bed with the chickens
what are you doing there?
then, to be sure, long before the bathometer read ,oo, then , feet, all-around there reigned perfect blackness-the darkness of interstellar space unvisited for eternities by even the weakest ray of sun, the eternally silent and maiden night, which now had to endure being illumined by and examined under a brutal artificial beam, not of cosmic origins, but brought down from the world above
settembrini did not like the idea—hans castorp was shrewd and sensitive enough to see that quite clearly
carducci wouldn’t have been all that happy with him, either
we cannot call you consul buddenbrook yet, i suppose?
how could i wait any longer?
and i reply: because it loosens and delivers, because it is a deliverance, and not deliverance from evil, but evil deliverance
therefore, to your consolation, let it be said that hell will have nothing essentially new to offer you-only that to which you are more or less customed, proudly customed
and then our emotions are inflamed
he took a step back, spread his arms wide, displaying both palms to her, and spoke with all the seriousness a man of honor and determination can muster: you realize, mademoiselle buddenbrook, do you not, that i cannot allow myself to be insulted in this fashion?
i knew from very reliable sources, my friends, the awful risks he was taking behind ratenkamp’s back, lending money here and taking out credit there, all in the firm’s name
dear father, please, take the armchair, he said gently
i’ve got to be on my way, and i mean right now

but if i tried to see him through the young lady's eyes, the affair lost its validity
you see this knob here, this little raised spot?
the cellos enlarge on this for a while, shaking their wise heads in regret over this riddle, and at a given, carefully considered point in their comments, the wind instruments, after a preparatory deep breath that causes shoulders to rise and fall again, enter with a chorale, stirringly solemn, splendidly harmonized, and played with all the muted dignity and gently constrained power of brass
a warm relationship between doctor and patient is certainly to be welcomed, and there is something to the proposition that only he who suffers can be the guide and healer of the suffering
i spoke quite rightly, by the way, since the whole wizardry is osmosis, a diffusion of liquor, a proliferous process
sit down, he said in his contrabass voice
great many of those that came from his pupils, male and female
we have him to thank for the hague conventions, superior moral realities that will abide

i’ll look in on you again before i go
it was not merely that i did not look forward to the event-i will enlarge on my confession and record that i was even tempted to absent myself

it was claimed, however, that hugo weinschenk, having immediately received confidential news of these calamities from his agents, had with fraudulent intent reinsured the policies with other insurance companies, thereby passing the losses on to them
that at least was hans castorp’s impression, a purely dreamy, irrational impression of course, which he could not get out of his befuddled brain for the moment and which even gave him a certain pleasure—such pleasure, in fact, that he tried to recapture it several times during the course of the meal and, indeed, was able to recreate the illusion perfectly
ha, ha, how spooky
my boshy kock hanna—they wouldn’t be that hardhearted
but i would much prefer to see the interior portrait you have locked up in your room
they arrived wearing mantillas and large platterlike hats and carrying bags of groceries for their visits among the poor—one could hardly prevent them from visiting their sick friend
what did he do?
frau chauchat, joachim said quietly
i was unable to say much; schildknapp, always a very good and receptive audience, was much more quick-witted and clever than i in commenting on what had been offered us-whereas afterward i sat over pranzo at the manardis' table, numb and preoccupied, still moved by those very feelings that the music we had just

the marriage of which little johann was the issue had never lost its appeal as a topic of conversation among the town’s citizens
that laugh stayed with him; i often heard it later when, sitting by my side at a concert or in the theater, he would be struck by some fine psychological allusion in the dialogue of a drama or by some trick of art, some ingenious event deep within the m�sical structure, of which the audience had no comprehension
the situation was untenable, there were ugly scenes, and although frau permaneder interceded for her with the same eloquence with which she had pled for two family homes and their furnishings, old ida was dismissed
and, still shaking his head, he departed
then she leaned back and let her pale eyes drift off to the world beyond the window
and on june , he gave a speech in the assembly on the most boring topic in the world, some tax problem or other, and it was so excellent and witty that it met with agreement on all points and made a laughing-stock of his opponent, consul hagenström
mes respects, monsieur le professeur
young commercial apprentices from good families, wearing danish seaman’s caps or clad elegantly in the latest english style and carrying portfolios, passed by with considerable dignity, proud of having escaped secondary school at last
to speak, to write—indeed that was a splendid humanistic and republican achievement, like that of signore brunetto latini, who had written a book about virtue and vice, had given the florentines their polish and taught them both how to speak and the fine art of guiding their republic by the rules of politics
you’re very mistaken about her
what a hell of a thing to have happen!
i will not play it!
commercial competence isn’t quite enough
whenever frau permaneder came over and pressed him to her, he would shed tears; most of the time, however, he simply sat there staring straight ahead, blinking now and then, but with dry eyes and a revolted, preoccupied look on his face
it was not all that stupid of you to leave your hamburg to fend for itself for a while
but since this hand has reason to tremble in any case because of my subject,!
schildknapp distinguished himself by knowing the names of this or that wall of peaks that could be made out

after a final admonition to use each needle only once and to treat the disks the way you would raw eggs, behrens had retired for the evening
it was no longer a simple case of lending assistance to the medium’s subjectivity so that it might find a mirror in reality, but rather—at least partially, at least tentatively—certain selves from outside, from beyond, got mixed up in things; what they were dealing with—possibly, though never expressly admitted—were nonvital elements, entities that used the convoluted, furtive opportunity of the moment to return to matter and manifest themselves to whoever called them—in short, the spiritualistic conjuring of the dead
well, she has asked me to come for a visit, and i’m thinking of taking advantage of the offer very soon
they walked to school together because they were neighbors, but usually they just annoyed each other
then the rambling old house lay tightly wrapped in darkness and silence
that was undoubtedly adrian's natural opinion as well
here we have a harmless antiseptic
pribislav had held his head like that, too; but he had been a model student and led a life full of honors (although that had not been the reason why hans castorp had borrowed a pencil from him)—whereas it was all too clear that frau chauchat’s careless posture, her door-slamming, and her brazen stares were bound up with her illness, that in fact they were all expressions of that same license young herr albin had praised, the advantages of which, if not honorable, were at least almost endless
it can work to his advantage
i know only a few, rasmussen replied, his hands dangling chest-high like fins
the girl will require one for another three years yet
question: how can germany, whichever of its forms it may be allowed to take in the future, so much as open its mouth again to speak of mankind's concerns?
hans castorp’s head was full of thoughts and associations that extended as far as people like the limping concierge and the woman who had kept one hand pressed to her ear for a whole week and was told nevertheless to set her mind at ease; there were questions on the tip of his tongue, but he could not get them out and decided instead to ask them of the director in private
i always have the impression that what is really important to him is not the lecture itself—perhaps that’s only secondary—but more especially the speaking of it, the way he lets his words roll and bounce, like little rubber balls
you see, here is a door, a courtyard door, it is open, beyond it lies the street
and he saw inside him, too
you must admit that on its other side it has it suitableness-on that side from which you came by it, and indeed forewarned, on the side of your pretty song with its alphabetical symbol-oh, truly wittily done and very near by inspiration:
there was obviously no happier man, no one who could have been more at home in this style of life or have found in it a greater fulfillment of his wishes
there was not a breath of wind to brush softly against the trees, not a rustle, not the call of a bird
but it was his father’s voice, and it said, the lieutenant has been in there with mama for two hours now, hanno

and yet there is something that some of us fear-at certain moments that seem criminal even to ourselves,
it was a miracle, she said, that the horseman had lived to see the holidays
because, you see, your heart pounds when you’re looking forward to some joyous event or if you’re afraid—when your emotions are stirred up, isn’t that right?
you refuse, and that ought to be a greater disappointment to me than it actually is
early in , hugo weinschenk’s petition for pardon was granted by the senate, and the former insurance director was released six months before his sentence was up
and as for the degradation of man, its history coincides exactly with the rise of the bourgeois spirit
hermann hagenström was the sort of imposing fellow familiar on the stock market of any great city; he was dressed in a thick, heavy fur coat that reached to his shoes and hung open to reveal a greenish yellow winter suit of durable english tweed
a little soothing syrup, perhaps a cup of camomile tea to induce perspiration
and he tossed the offending stump into the punch bowl
but he who would not hear of the logos, said, reason!
when god visits us with affliction, we must bear it with composure
good god in heaven, there are certain things that must be taken into consideration in this life, tom
he got himself ready for his rest cure, stuck his thermometer in his mouth, put perfected skills to work and with a few deft, sure motions of the sacred art—about which no one in the flatlands had the vaguest—he wrapped his two camel-hair blankets around him to form a solid, unbroken cylinder, and lay there quietly on his splendid lounge chair, in the cold damp of the early autumn afternoon
oh indeed, he sometimes truly seemed to be won over-given how extraordinarily easy it was to influence him
but i will remind him that through the liturgy and its history, music plays a considerable role in theological affairs-a more practical and artistic role in fact than in the areas of mathematics' and physics, in acoustics, that is

but let me ask you one thing
he was a stocky, broad-shouldered man with a red face, watery-blue eyes, and a frosted, bristly beard that ran in a fan shape from ear to ear—but the firm red curve of his upper lip was clean-shaven
countless local chapters have been established in various countries, their purpose being to inform and educate by means of public lectures and sunday festivities
for he had been a monkey, moon, and soul god—a baboon with a crescent moon above his head and above all, under the name of hermes, a god of death and the dead, a grabber and guide of souls, who by late antiquity had become a great sorcerer and served the cabalistic middle ages as the father of hermetic alchemy
he saw someone come out, too, a lady who had arrived only recently and whose name he did not know—a small, dainty woman, with curls across her forehead and golden earrings
regular birds of paradise, i tell you, and eminently amorous
in terms of art, what my friend had woven here was most admirable
this was on the night of may
nevertheless, the firm of johann buddenbrook was no longer what it had once been—that, too, was such common knowledge that herr stuht on glockengiesser strasse could share it with his wife over bacon soup at lunch
whenever herr ferge spoke about these events, his good-natured gray eyes grew wide and his face grew pallid—it must have been horrible
hans castorp had sat through the incident with every outward sign of concerned horror, but ultimately—god help him!—not even this event seemed all that serious
he had little appetite and trouble sleeping; chills, which had always been a problem, now forced him to consult dr langhals on several occasions
but since this was not a matter of praise or censure, but simply a factual observation and determination, and since there is always some approbation in every dispassionate recognition of reality, stemming simply from the joy of recognizing it, how could such views not be linked to a multifaceted, indeed comprehensive critique of the bourgeois tradition-by which i mean values like culture, enlightenment, humanity, and dreams like the improvement of nations through scientific civilization?
the senses are diminished, a merciful self-narcosis sets in—those are the means by which nature allows the organism to find relief
all the beautiful old furniture, hans castorp went on, remembering

to discreet orchestral accompaniment, a veritable international chorus of celebrated singers, male and female, put their highly trained, god-given talents to good use in arias, duets, ensemble scenes from all the many epochs and genres of musical theater: the mediterranean bel canto, captivating in both its lighthearted and noble forms; a german world of folklore, rogues, and demons; french opera, grand and comic
but i did it with gravest reservations, under the proudest, most excruciating protest of my spirit against the dictates of my wretched body
he slept for three hours—a deep, sleep, immeasurably deep, unlike any he had ever known
god neither wanted that nor did he want evil not to occur, but rather he allowed evil to hold sway without wanting or not wanting it, and that, to be sure, worked to the advantage of perfect wholeness
both a miracle and, in response to the final compelling voice of conscience, the means by which he triumphed over himself
munich streetcars, painted bavarian blue, are heavily built and make considerable noise, whether because of their weight or some special quality of the subsoil
and one should not be surprised if at first i shall find it rather daring to utter this new form of address and stumble in the attempt—particularly in the presence of clavdia, who, being but a woman, may not be quite so pleased with this new arrangement

but six learned and competent alienists had officially determined the king's total madness and declared it necessary that he be confined!
christian had certainly not grown any handsomer
and hans castorp thought that was marvelous—as was also the fact that life here had no cares or worries to block the view
they had breakfast on the balcony or under the tall chestnut tree over by the children’s playground with its large swing—and johann was enchanted by all of it: the scent that rose from the hastily laundered tablecloth as a waiter spread it out before them, the tissue-paper napkins, the unfamiliar bread, the fact that they ate their eggs from metal eggcups, and with everyday teaspoons instead of the bone-handled ones they used at home
the vista broadened to the northeast toward the entrance to the valley and included the lake, as expected—a frozen, snow-covered circle surrounded by forest
how could i have known any different?
primitive peoples’ understanding of such drugs far exceeded our own
and now he demanded to know other things
a gift of life, i responded, if not to say, a gift of god, such as music, should not have the mocking charge of paradox leveled at it for
he saw the evergreen wood below and behind him now; turning around he quickly descended to the snow-laden firs, a last spur of steep, fogged-in forests, that jutted like a wedge out into open ground
whether he understand rightly about life remains a question
herr settembrini strode across the room to a window
there’s simply nothing in it
and each time the odor surfaced and he smelled it, he scowled a little more and his lips trembled for just a second
but now enjoy your breakfast and the rest of the morning
the woman of whom you made mention—pardon me for choosing not to recall her name—frau stöhr, yes, thank you—in brief, it is this ridiculous woman herself, and not her case, it seems to me, that presents our human emotions with a dilemma, as you put it
and music can do that as well
for god’s sake, papa—!
after a sigh that sounded like a preface to his remarks, the italian began to speak
it was he, out of a sense of his own smallness, who came up with the word inaccessible, which served as an occasion for herr settembrini to stress that, of course, those rocks had surely been scaled
he would stand there in his checked trousers, a toothpick between his lips, assume his graceful pose with his ankles crossed, and chatter away, gesticulating now and then with the toothpick
as soon as the other guests departed, the three lodgers almost immediately withdrew to their rooms
he saw him turn away and, as misery played across the upper lip, slowly sneak an over-the-shoulder look out of the corner of one eye
keep that in mind !
and we don’t even speak of the coupé anymore, although it’s as necessary as our daily bread
her stay up here went back to long before hans castorp’s arrival; it was more than a year since she had first come here—with a slight infection for which she had been sentenced to three months
essay on marionettes, plus the inevitable sonnets of shakespeare, and another volume of plays by the same poet-twelfth night was one, much ado about nothing, and if i am not mistaken, two gentlemen of verona
he told us we should find a seat (the swiss way of asking someone to sit down); and so we did, with the elf between us on the grass, and joined him in looking at his picture book, which among the stock of children's literature offered in the shop had surely been among the most acceptable, with illustrations in the english taste, in a kind of kate greenaway style, and not half-bad rhymed verses, almost all of which nepomuk
hans castorp did not look up
you can read it in three boring minutes
i can well understand, however, that, given this momentary relaxation in the pat-
her dainty finger resting lightly on the glass, ellen brand focused her large, pure, childlike eyes beyond immediate matters and directed her gaze instead at the nightstand lamp
but today the wind had shifted around to the west, and simultaneously the barometer had plummeted
once before, only four years ago, with the knife already at our throat, with the rope around our neck—suddenly the floor of the exchange was filled with shouts announcing an engagement to mademoiselle buddenbrook, before it had ever occurred
you’ll have nothing, you’ll be poor as a church mouse, you’ll have to make your own way, all by yourself
and the first hour, religion with herr ballerstedt, was a rather harmless affair
the silk cravat wound around his stiff high-wing collar was fluffed to fill the broad, open neck of his multicolored vest
he had been lying there dozing for fifteen minutes or half an hour, when he was startled awake by the sudden realization that the assistant was in his room, striding toward him, having entered not by way of the door, but from outside
at least this was hans castorp’s impression, as he sat there expectantly waiting, along with all the others, to learn in what form unsanctioned love would reappear
you have to be quiet
please excuse us for having made you wait, kesselmeyer, herr grünlich said
the spot at the upper left isn’t worth talking about
but you compromise us, all of us, no matter where you are, where you go
the consul flared up
the young men tried to comfort her, said something about the possibility of a happy turn for the better
and the very next day senator buddenbrook stood in the council chamber, right in front of the chair formerly occupied by james möllendorpf, and, in the presence of the assembled city fathers and a committee from the town council, he swore the following oath:
it was very natural that music should catch fire from words, that the word should burst from music, as happened at the end of the ninth symphony
there was a fireplace with imitation coals and stripes of shiny reddish-gold paper that seemed to glow behind the screen
but the universal principle of the law had inspired him from infancy on, or so his grandson would have them believe; and although hans castorp was not feeling all that clearheaded as his organism strained to deal with one of the berghof’s six-course meals, he struggled to understand what settembrini might mean by calling this principle the source of freedom and progress
in a fit of royal fury at the sudden disruption of his feast of life, peeperkorn first banged his fist on the table and then called out after the scattering company—something about spineless slaves—but nevertheless reconciled himself somewhat to the idea presented by hans castorp and frau chauchat that his banquet had lasted for almost six hours now and would have to come to an end at some point in any case, even lent his ear to a reminder about sleep’s holy refreshment, and at last consented to let them escort him to bed
what made it possible for certain olfactory nerves to be stimulated by various odors?
there was almost nothing fragmented about it
and suggested that i should adopt my cousin’s style of life here—lie out on the balcony a great deal, even said i should measure my temperature, too
she said nothing, but merely let her eyes sweep over him in a profoundly amazed and profoundly offended glance
i’m a simple man and don’t know much about innuendies [sic] and other such refinements, but if you just might be implying … well, all i have to say to you is that you’re barking up the wrong tree and are badly mistaken about my principles
his affliction was the model of a particularly heavy and welldeveloped stutter-how tragic, since he was a man with a great wealth of urgent ideas and a passionate desire to communicate them in speech
heine seehas is a well-known drunk who pushes a little wagon and sells steamed dumplings
a quarter till eight, she answered, her thin, red hand—it looked gouty—pointing at the wall clock
frau permaneder coughed an audible dry cough that she simply could not suppress
and while all this was going on, hans castorp thought he could smell more clearly than before those faint, but very peculiar and persistent fumes that he knew from before, and which, to his shame, always reminded him of a school chum who suffered from an offensive affliction that made everyone avoid him, the same odor that the tuberose scent was supposed to cover up on the sly, but was unable to do, for all its lovely, austere richness
they all chinked shallow goblets and drank the first glass down, electrifying their stomachs with its ice-cold, fragrant tickle
i have been made an alderman on the bergen line board of directors, and have been chosen as a committee member for the finance department, the chamber of commerce, the auditing committee, and the st anne poorhouse, one after another
the eyes gazed out pale and dull from under the idol-like tracery of the brow; the large, ragged lips hung half-open, like the mouth on the mask of tragedy
the decisive thing is that each tone, without exception, retains its positional value in the row or in one of its derivatives
i wish to go even farther and admit that i could take no great liking to or place unequivocal trust in anyone at this roundtable, with the possible exception of helmut institoris, who also sometimes attended these discussions and with whom i felt a bond of friendship through my relation with his wife-although, to be sure, his presence awakened anxious worries of another sort
the remarkable man quickly came to a decision
she sent her warmest regards
but we can’t let ourselves be cowed, and we need a direct line to hamburg
yes, tom said, i know exactly what you mean, tony
at first the rooms held the warmth of the preceding summer days—fifty-five degrees, which was considered comfortable—but they quickly grew colder and colder
no, to be quite frank, i don’t find it that overwhelming, hans castorp said
he had now had enough
that course seemed finer and more humane—and i’m sure you know how clavdia drawls the word out so charmingly in that magical, husky voice of hers—than silence and dissembling, and to that extent a weight was lifted from my heart, when you made your observation just now
fine, but don’t you think that if he’s a jesuit first and a man of intellect, with permutations, second—that the second part has something to do with his illness?
one can imagine adrian's amusement at these woefully funny accounts of scenes experienced with all the intensity of youth, though we always had to curb our laughter somewhat and keep it within the bounds of empathy-it was the storyteller's father after all
it may serve you in good stead when i say that at your age i took special care, both in bergen and in antwerp, to be pleasant and useful to my employers, which always proved to be to my great advantage
what sort of a bet would
it corresponds to beethoven's general technical niveau, does it not?-as the tension between the utmost dissonance and consonance possible to him
you’re thinking of the earthquake in messina
an apparent chase around the furniture, the crash of an upturned chair, a grab, an embrace, slaps and kisses—and then, of all things to accompany the invisible scene, a waltz was struck up in the distance, the tired melody of a popular ballad
an increase in metabolism caused an increase in the production of body heat
and if i had run into him down in the flatlands, i’m sure i would not have understood them, he added
also in the party were the thick-lipped lad from the half-lung club; fräulein levi, looking as thin and ivory-skinned as ever; an ash-blond young man who answered to the name of rasmussen and dangled his hands chest-high, like fins at the end of limp wrists; frau salomon from amsterdam, a lady of ample proportions, who was dressed in red and had joined the young people; the tall gentleman with the thinning hair who could play selections from a midsummer night’s dream and who now sat behind her, his arms hugging pointed knees, his gloomy eyes fixed on the brown hair at the nape of her neck; a red-haired young lady from greece; another girl of unknown origin with the face of a tapir; the gluttonous adolescent with the thick, circular glasses; another fifteen- or sixteen-year-old boy, who squinted through a monocle and at every cough put his little finger, its long nail shaped very much like a saltcellar spoon, to his lips—a first-class ass, it would seem; and several others
i’m jist a poor man, ladies ’nd gents, but i got a tender heart, and the joy ’nd happiness what touches my master, consul buddenbrook, who’s alliz been good to me, why, that touches me, too, so i’m here to heartily ’gratulate herr buddenbrook ’nd his good wife ’nd the whole ’spectable fam’ly, ’nd to wish this here child a long, healthy life, ’cause they well deserve it, afore god and man they do, ’nd there ain’t many men like herr buddenbrook, no, sir, ’cause he’s a fine gen’leman ’nd the good lord ’ll see to it he’s rewarded…
there were long arithmetic problems that filled both sides of their slates, and when you were done with all the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the answer had to be zero—and if it wasn’t, there must be a mistake somewhere, and you had to search and search until you found the nasty little beast and erased it, and you could only hope that it wasn’t too far back, because otherwise the whole thing had to be done over
but there were unmistakable signs that his sense of personal modesty was beginning to break down as well
frau stöhr licked her fingers with gusto
hanno, the senator said curtly
then i’ll be asittin’ up on the sofa in a silk dress, and you’ll be waitin’ on me, ’cause … it went without saying that she had been let go at once
i thought he was right when, in conversations with me as well, he would emphatically, even urgently champion his pupil's calling to be a musician, a composer
the words, for i die as both a wicked and good christian, provide the general theme for this work of variations
and then came a brief improvement: a flickering of life, a deceptive return of energy, an ebbing of the fever, a cessation of pain, a few clear and hopeful words that brought tears of joy to the eyes of those around her bed
the underside, however, was inscribed in a variety of ever-changing scripts with the names of those heads of the household who had been its owners over the course of time
and now it’s come to this
i see it here every day
and while the cousins laughed, settembrini moved on from the topic of the warmth for which he so yearned, to the subject of his deceased father
or the sound of the orchestra tuning up
nevertheless, i would note that it is regrettable—though characteristic of the institution—that you have neglected to read what the press has to say
as impossible as i t was to find an emotional correlation between his deteriorating health and our national calamity, my inclination to see some objective connection or symbolic parallel between the two, an inclination that may well have been based merely on their contemporaneity, was not vanquished by his remoteness from outside events-though i carefully kept that thought to myself and took pains not even to hint at it in conversation with him
frau chauchat broke in now, saying that this was not good for peeperkorn, that the conversation was fatiguing him, might cause another fever attack, and as much as she disliked interrupting their visit, she really did have to ask hans castorp to let that be all for now
far be it from me, as to herr settembrini and your friendly sentiments toward him—settled
herr hagenström, partner in the export firm of strunck & hagenström, took eager and ambitious interest in the affairs of the town, but his marriage had caused some astonishment among families with stricter traditions—the möllendorpfs, the langhalses, the buddenbrooks
in general such a claim to ironic distance, to an objectivity that assuredly has less to do with the honor of the cause than with that of the detached person, has always seemed to me to be a sign of inordinate arrogance
yes indeed—and then again, not at all like them
outside was gloomy nothing, a world packed in grayish-white cotton, in foggy vapors and whirling snow that pushed up against the windowpanes
would such ideas really look good on him?
no, kesselmeyer, listen to me
what are you doing?
the woman who read aloud for them sat off at some distance
almost like a plank, with a slight rise in the blanket from the feet at the other end
it is nonsense, of course, for a murderer to outlive his victim
whom the waves of active life have borne upon their shoulders, good fortune playing round his brow, that man had no need of such thoughts
degrees—and in the middle of the morning
his brother the consul, however, knew—he knew that christian offered the family’s adversaries an easy target, and that this was one target too many
his tawny golden muttonchops were disheveled, his coat was all wrinkled, his necktie askew, his collar stood open, and little drops of sweat stood out on his brow
naphta screamed, conceding with this very human cry that it requires more courage to shoot than to be shot at, raised his pistol to a position that had nothing to do with the duel, and shot himself in the head
the director was painting her, interpreting her external appearance with color and oils on canvas
the previous chapter, as its continuation
it was schubert’s lindenbaum, none other than the old familiar am brunnen vor dem tore
own, swear fealty to it, identify with it, the day would come when he would very quickly be disenchanted with it as well, be bored by it, be as weary and fed up with it as if he had been force-fed with iron ladles
look, he is stepping on the hand of a fallen comrade—stepping on it with his hobnailed boots, pressing it deep into the soggy, branch-strewn earth
hans castorp stayed behind on his balcony, depressed and sorely tempted to go see the boss then and there
in an hour or so
he is the reverend andreas pringsheim, pastor marianus, who, although still very young, assumed the pastorate of st mary’s after old kölling died unexpectedly
the face assumes an idiotic expression

it had two curved, shiny steel tines with extremely sharp points, between them a coiled segment of gold-inlaid ivory with tines of its own, which were more pliant or flexible to some degree and could be bent inward
or the silent elation that frau permaneder felt when she first heard it and embraced her mother, her brother, and—more gingerly—her sister-in-law?
but then the fellow pulls out a knife, and … for some inexplicable reason thomas did not greet these stories, of which christian had a great many, with applause—although madame grünlich found them delightfully amusing, while her mother, clara, and klothilde pulled back in horror, and mamselle jungmann and erika simply sat there listening with their mouths open
he flipped the switch that sent current to the turntable, waited two seconds until it had reached top speed, and carefully set the fine steel point down on the rim of the disk
and cast aside the delicate little song as tasteless and insipidly sentimental—rejecting it, however, with a certain austere melancholy
i’ve always been of the opinion that all men are equal, and that we don’t need any middlemen between us and our god
in italy, schildknapp had written his former landlords on amalien strasse and secured his familiar quarters anew
you say some simple word,
for adrian had let it be known in his notes that he wished to give a favorably disposed gathering of friends an idea of his new, recently completed choral and symphonic work by playing some characteristic passages from it on the piano
and so, in the period that followed, he was stricter than ever about drilling hanno in the practical things that would be important in his future life and work; he examined his intellectual abilities, pressed him for decisive statements about his love of the occupation awaiting him, and burst into rage at every sign of resistance and languor
despite his isolation, his curiosity did not go beyond asking if new guests had arrived or any familiar faces had departed; and he seemed content to learn that only the former was the case
you have guessed it, herr settembrini said delicately
there’s no shortage of ladies—we have the most adorable ladies here
had he amused himself?
yes, yes, tony, i’ve thought a lot about it myself
it is unclear whether this occurred with the knowledge and permission of the latter; it is certain, however, that christian buddenbrook found, at no expense whatever, the same homey diversions that senator gieseke spent a great deal of his wife’s money to enjoy
all right, hanno, but first you have to get a good night’s sleep
he showed signs of life, but was hideously injured
this pitiful creature had understood from hans castorp’s sensitivity about slamming doors that a certain emotional bond was developing between her young tablemate and the russian woman, and what was more, that the nature of such a bond was less important than that it existed at all, and finally, that his pretended indifference—and given his lack of talent or experience as an actor, he was very poor at pretending—did not diminish but rather strengthened that bond, was a sign that it had moved to a higher plane
but they also served another purpose—one that little hans castorp likewise noted, if not admitting it to himself in so many words; in particular, the masses of flowers and more especially the very well represented tuberoses were there for a more sobering reason—and that was to gloss over the other side of death, the one that is neither beautiful nor sad, but almost indecent in its base physicality, to make people forget it or at least not be reminded of it
but the magical thing about it is that what gets preserved in them has been withdrawn from time, has been hermetically blocked off from time, which passes right by
people did not trust those eyes
he (gazing down over himself with arms spread wide): how then, how then?
there was a preachy flavor to it, although it was delivered in the light, bantering tone of small talk
(to use luther's expression) with untold crimes, a state whose bellowing proclamations and announcements canceling human rights swept the masses up into enraptured frenzy, and under whose garish banners our youth marched with flashing eyes, brazenly proud and firm in their faith-a patriotism that would proclaim that such a state was forced upon us as something without roots in our nature as a people, something totally alien to us, such a patriotism would, so it seems to me, be more high-minded than conscientious
he inquired about tony’s fields and cattle, asked how much she wanted for a sack of wheat, and offered her a contract
even the merchant tailor in rostock had done very well, and the family had continued to prosper spectacularly ever since
but there was little chance that he would be hired—his classes were much too exuberant
dear boy, one always has a host of fellows
the destruction of the body by fire—what a neat, hygienic, dignified, and indeed heroic idea that was in comparison with letting it decompose miserably on its own and be assimilated by lower forms of life
but do not say, 'spe�ks only about aesthetics,  do not say,
consul buddenbrook said to his wife: if only i could think of some reason, however delicate, tony might have for deciding against this alliance

in , although the source of the grant was never clear, it was the world
useful visual aids for the instruction of the young
i don’t want to have anything to do with it
he moved toward the buffet and drank a glass of water to calm his heart—or perhaps just for something to do
he suddenly cried in a rapturous outburst

because i can’t live down south, by god and all his heavenly hosts, i can’t
you’ve been yowling all afternoon
why don’t you ever want me to go into town?
i should not misunderstand her: there could be no doubt that rudolf's character had a certain more noble foundation
adrian could have no doubt whatever that in his solitude he had at his disposal what his worldly admirer had to offer-her riches, which as one clearly sensed, were a burden to her for reasons of conscience, though she had never known, presumably could not have led, a life without them
consul eduard kistenmaker the wine merchant and consul hermann hagenström held their own on the list
he praised the pleasures of riding, the way the body was moved along in comfortable repose past constantly changing scenery; he assumed an obliging, fatherly tone with hans castorp and even patted poor wehsal’s cheek, urging him to lose himself and his unattractive ego in admiration of this bright, shining world, to which he pointed in a broad gesture of his right hand, inside its shabby leather glove
are you saying she was kicking with her legs?
they were at a difficult age
there was a great deal of loyalty in your conduct
see, i want to avoid a direct attack, but i also want to avoid approaching her by mail
the door to the antechamber was wide open and her sister-in-law came toward her
but such effects were as legitimate as the changes that came with the evolution of the learned doctor’s thought—an evolution he saw as not only consistent, but also inevitable
they inquired about the young people’s plans, which, even at this early stage, included the honeymoon
do you call the blue of the sky a sham?
of course, back then it was only a matter of … now, what was it?
ination has the advantage of being identical with the university of wittenberg, since the two were joined upon their reopening at the end of the napoleonic wars
our rosenstiel got it for me
and so you still believe that spirit is shameless, do you?
at the same time she felt reawakening within her the same emotion that she had toyed with during the days of herr grünlich’s courtship: a sense of personal importance
i’ll not let you talk me out of it
in brief, settembrini did not stint in his praise of ugly herr naphta, despite the rather abstract argument they had just had—a dispute that would very soon be taken up again
you had to pay close attention to catch each stealthy change in the misty phantasmagoria
this was the director’s way of offering consolation
whereas chamber music usually offers a playground for the working out of thematic motifs, here that is avoided in outright provocation
one might even have spoken of a neglect of his appearance, had such an impression not been curbed by the natural distinction that came with his intellect
he said, well, collect your thoughts now and continue
he was about to vanish beneath them when the farm hand plunged in after him and brought him to shore
i do not know, it sounds so 'hifalutin' and girlish
a man and a woman, a pair of highly talented professionals ineligible for competition, executed a feat no one else in the world could do—to great applause and a fanfare
he’s praising nature because even in her fertile phase she does not confuse us with mystic damps, but provides classical austerity
she broke off her chatter, didn’t even complete her hand gesture, and turned round to the bed, where the cry had come from—a cry of fear, which was immediately repeated, but now it sounded more anguished, more terrified, and then came a third, a fourth, a fifth, one right after another
then step up to the edge of these ashen glacial cliffs of dunes and climb, immerse yourself in softness that seeps cool into your shoes
on the following thursday, i heard from him by telephone
but listen here, professor—it seems to me he would have no reason, then, for criticizing any fanaticism or terrorism in my cousin’s vocation
it was bad enough that the anecdotes he told to his assembled family ought, at best, to have been restricted to the club
i did it nonetheless, told him in confidence that, from what i could see, even though inez rodde was about to become engaged to institoris, she was helplessly, fatally in love with rudi schwerdtfeger
they’re not stingy, you know
his father had tapped him on the shoulder and pointed out to him that the daughter of wealthy old kröger would bring a handsome dowry into the firm; and he had concurred with all his heart and ever since had honored his wife as a companion entrusted to him by god
but he was vexed by objective problems as well, about which the cousins had already heard: the sort of sanatorium affair with which everyone was only all too familiar
but everything in this world is comparative, uncle gotthold
kaisersaschern, he likewise first returned home, to buche!, to attend his sister's wedding, which was celebrated there and to which, along with my parents, i was invited as well
in presenting herself, clavdia had let her eyes sweep right past hans castorp and all the farther regions of the room; nothing happened at their next meeting in the dining hall, either; and the more meals that passed without his eye meeting hers—unless you counted frau chauchat’s blind, sweeping, impassive gaze if she happened to turn around during a meal—the more unsuitable it would have been to attempt his cavalier’s greeting
now and then, to be sure, if he happened to be alone with her, his mood could change and he would tease and joke with her, might even try to pull her onto his knee and brush his whiskers against her face, asking in a quivering, jolly voice, have i really nabbed you?
old hinrich had died at the beginning of , and his son hermann—hermann with the lemon buns and the slaps—was now carrying on his father’s very profitable export business at the side of old herr strunck; and within a year he married the daughter of consul huneus, the richest man in town, whose wholesale lumber business had enabled him to leave each of his three children two million marks
so why is my heart pounding like this?
heaven has decided otherwise
but when i’m lying there and watching the planets, then those last three thousand years seem fairly recent’ themselves, and somehow i feel very intimate with those chaldeans, who watched them, too, and wrote poetry about them—and that’s what humanity means
dr drögemüller in hamburg told me that all the nerves on this side are too short
thomas withheld his judgment
he asked, adopting a lighter tone
he was tense and nervous, like a young man about to introduce himself to a host of strangers, all the while plagued by the distinct feeling that his eyes and face are red—which was only partly true, because he was actually rather pale
frau antonie grünlich stood at the front door—proud of the arrangements she had made
she thrust her head slightly toward him, eyes closed, as if just blinking
he crossed the wooden bridge and sat down to enjoy the sight of the falling water and rushing foam, to listen to its idyllic chatter, a monotone filled with interior variety
it was no different when it came to ice-skating in winter or to swimming in summer down by the river, in the fenced-in area run by herr asmussen
you could, of course, present the issue to the lord god or herr marotzke as a topic of discussion
it will be said that the narrator is laying it on too thick, being too romantic in associating stupor with demonic forces, even ascribing to it some sort of mystic horror
can i bear what it says?
we know that he studied mathematics—know it from the director himself—and recall the chaste motive behind his devotion to the discipline, whose cooling effects and ability to blunt the thorn in the flesh we have heard praised and whose more general rewards would probably have rendered unnecessary certain measures that the authorities had recently been forced to adopt
should i likewise return to the sense of gentle affront or distress caused me personally by the subject itself, the mockery of the study of antiquity, which in the work appears as ascetic preciosity?

no wind, no snow
the french doorman said
oh, papa, i could write pages and pages about him

in hans castorp’s case the first day of october was exactly like the last day of september

soon after the new director’s arrival, renovation and modernization of the old institution had begun—according to the very latest hygienic and aesthetic criteria—and been very successfully completed
mother had hair like that when she was young
at either side of the door were smaller tables, likewise covered with white linen, each ornamented by a little tree with candles aflame and laden with presents—the gifts for the servants and the poor
rocks like basalt, remnants of former realities, which the spirit has left so far behind that it refuses even to associate the notion of reality with them, persist in their dogged way; their very lumpish, dead continuance unfortunately prevents them in their inanity from realizing how inane they are
this much was certain from the beginning: the, directive at the end was motivated not by the whole letter, but by only a portion of it, the so-called waggery and buffoonery, the experience with that dreadful porter
the majestic countenance was yellow, with pale eyes gazing out from under the raised tracery of the brow; the expression on the ragged lips was bitter
good heavens, armgard said, sitting on the edge of her bed, half undressed, dr neumann is such a fine lecturer

it had caught up with the times, and the gray, dilapidated walls of the former convent school, where the fathers of the present generation had pursued scientific learning, had been razed to make way for a splendid, new, airy edifice

well, fine, you find that here as well
himself born to be a productive writer and spoke bitterly of being driven by necessity to serve others' work, of being consumed by a task that brought scant recognition-and what little there was he found galling
what i mean is, of course there’s no question of my being bored here, quite the contrary—i can assure you that i’m amusing myself royally
yes, i admit that what contributed to almost all of my (some might say simple, i shall call it human) fear of the work was the absolutely uncanny rapidity with which it came into being-the bulk of it in four and a half months, the same time one might have estimated to be required
this man stood on his own feet, unencumbered by the chains of custom and reverence for the past—he was a stranger to anything old-fashioned
force—the application of dumb, brutal, instantaneous force by the police—without any understanding of intellectual matters, of new ideas
yes, things could get lively today, hanno
with all their hearts they despised the economic principle that declares price is the result of the workings of supply and demand, and they damned those who lived by the fluctuations of the market as exploiters of their neighbors

oh, you’re staying in travemünde for only a short while?
when they came back up from their meal, the package of blankets was lying on a chair in hans castorp’s room, and he made use of them that day for the first time

i felt, living there in halle, whose intellectual atmosphere had for centuries been full of religious controversy-that is, of those intellectual squabbles and clashes that are always so detrimental to humanistic cultural endeavors-i felt there a little like one of my learned forebears, crotus rubianus, who was a canon in halle around   , and whom luther called crotus the epicurean no less, or even dr krote, the toad who licks plates for the cardinal of mainz
the experience of death must ultimately be the experience of life, or else it is only a wraith

apparently frau chauchat had practice in determining the direction of his semiwishes
what are you laughing about?
signum mortificationis,  was that it?
but here mother glances at him out of the corner of her eye, and tom raises his eyebrow, and uncle justus flinches and almost splutters, the way krögers do when they laugh, and pfiffi buddenbrook gives her mother or friederike or henriette a look, and then i’m so ashamed that i’d just as soon leave the room, and can’t even imagine i could ever marry him
heads turned from settembrini to naphta—hans castorp’s more quickly than joachim’s
we’re going to be sensible, right?
well, there were and are a great many mementos of egypt in freemasonry, and among its secret societies were some that used the name eleusinian
they were not always ushered in to see adrian, actually only rarely, which did not bother either of them
i already said that as a scholar, as a man of science, kumpf made concessions to the rational critique of biblical faith and, at least by fits and starts, would abandon some things in a tone of intellectual candor
yes,  christian says, yes, tiburtius, god go with you
what does deciderant, patula jovis arbore, glandes’ mean?
mirth and delight reigned around the table
autumn arrived, the first strong winds had begun to blow
during the whole quarrel, the consul had stood with his back to his brother, his hands in his pockets, drawing little figures in the carpet with one foot
several years before, he had retired with a tidy sum in his pocket and had left the wine business in the hands of his brother, eduard
you think he will contest it, simply because of my seventeen thousand thalers courant
he was wearing white kid gloves and carried his cane with its silver crook under his left arm
why should i think otherwise!
i do not like hearing you handing nature over to evil, i replied
and now, after three months, with a temperature between  and
then it wasn’t just rain, but a whitish-gray mixture of snow and rain, and finally just snow that came in squalls that filled the whole valley
little antonie had not let her grandfather disturb her sled ride, had merely extended her naturally slightly protruding upper lip in a little pout
for it was his sincere desire faithfully to defend and uphold that dignity in his own eyes, however difficult that might be after an almost six-month stay among people up here
anna asked with a sob
even herr stuht on glockengiesser strasse told his wife, who always moved in the best circles, lemme tell you, those two com’lement each other real good
be careful now, we’re going to look right through you both
they all assumed that he would immediately cease this pointless activity, to which they responded with disconcerted smiles; but he went on holding forth in the all-devouring din
et je le regrette beaucoup
even his youthful mustache, trimmed on a slant to the corners of his mouth, was so spare that it could never have been shaped to a handlebar or extended to points, and that only added to his less-than-martial appearance
no, he really had not entirely forgotten his latin
his discourses would begin on dove’s feet, but soon, when he turned to liberated peoples uniting for universal happiness, there would come a sound as of the rushing pinions of eagles—not that he wished it or even knew whence it came, though doubtless it originated in the politics he had inherited from his grandfather, which had then blended with the humanistic inheritance of his father to create beautiful literature within him, lodovico, just as humanity and politics were blended in the lofty idea of civilization, to which he raised a toast, an idea full of the mildness of the dove and the boldness of the eagle and awaiting its day, the dawn of the day of nations, when the principle of obduracy would be defeated and a path opened for the holy alliance of bourgeois democracy
german deeds have always been done out of a certain immaturity, and it is not for nothing that we are the people of the reformation
and a good day to you, missy
but when by month five she can no longer walk, she writes her husband back by the baltic, and behrens receives a letter from him—the envelope is marked personal and urgent in a vigorous hand, i saw it myself
a rosy glow came to her cheeks and lingered there
people rubbed their eyes, stared straight ahead, felt embarrassed by the brightness and demanded the return of the dark, so that they could again watch things, whose time had passed, come to pass again, tricked out with music and transplanted into new time
she felt so weak that she didn’t even try to hold back the tears that slowly welled into her eyes again and again
there you will find, if i am not mistaken, an untiring interest in discussion and one hell of a lot of dialectic tension
it was a downright racket—it dashed, splashed, babbled, and foamed
i told him that i would find a hotel room for the night and look for something suitable the next day
gathering her skirts in one hand, she bent low as she took those two steps, and with her other small, heavily ringed hand, she pressed a handkerchief to her mouth—above it, her large, pale, distraught eyes stared at nothing
at first the woman pleaded with him in vain-on her knees toward the end-to spare her, to release her, not to force her to pay for peace of mind by betraying the man who loved her and whom she loved in return
how could that be?
the rain had stopped, and now and then a bird released a delicate, questioning twitter that blended with the sporadic sound of dripping trees and shrubs
a little later, around seven o’clock, he would sit there a fifth time—that would be for supper
i can’t go on, christian replied and sat down facing sideways on one of the high-backed chairs set around the dining table; he held his hat and walking stick between his knees
but let me ask you one question
aline is a …
he was married and even had a little daughter, but for some time now he had been separated from his wife and lived quite the bachelor life
i shall hold to their side, here in my soul, and not with naphta, or for that matter with settembrini—they’re both windbags
an old woman screeched
i really do like it for people to be a little more devout once in a while
at first he had to put up with being supervised by the attendant who brought him back
frau stöhr, as we know, had felt that way from the first; she found her own vulgar skepticism, with which she had sent joachim on his way down to the flatlands, confirmed, and did not mind praising herself for it
do indeed stand up and enter through the next door to my left, where my bedchamber lies (the other being farther on the same side), take from the press my winter coat that i wear in rome on days of tramontane and brought along perforce, for i knew not where to leave it elsewise; do on my hat as well, snatch up my plaid rug, and return thus furnished to my place
but had he not always known that?
it was learned, further, that since early childhood ellen had experienced visions, although at wide intervals, both visible and invisible
the last few days i’ve been thinking about a turkish proverb i read somewhere: when the house is finished, death follows
and even on days when peeperkorn was free of fever, hans castorp would spend several hours with him and his pearl-necklaced traveling companion
of an evening, he was often seen in the deserted and dimly lit dining hall, still sitting at his place, a piece of string carefully laid out in a circle on the bare tabletop; suddenly he would reach out in a surprise attack and pull it straight, only to hunch over again, prop himself on his elbows, and sink into bitter brooding
in reality, it was something entirely different that brought the edginess to joachim’s voice and made him mention the recent lecture on botany in such a sarcastic tone
subject of of the
he shouted and walked to the door—and slammed it behind him
hanno stayed behind in the dining room alone
i have some important work to do with this gentleman, his father continued
i would tell him tales of a father, even i would tell him of the tears in my father's eye when he would say:
you should be ashamed of yourself, worshiping success like that, herr settembrini chided him
a russian wave of attack is moving at full force, has taken vitebsk and is now threatening minsk, the capital of belorussia, after whose fall, so the whisperers allege, there can be no stopping the foe in the east, either
and so he had left it hanging in place
one could in fact remedy that ignominy, he said gaily
as he emerged on becker grube, he heard footsteps behind him and spotted gosch the broker, a picturesque figure wrapped in a long coat, who was also heading up the steep hill for the meeting
it was late october, the weather was still dry, though already raw and gloomy
and then, suddenly, she flinched and swallowed hard, her whole face a play of nervous, eager movement, her lips quickly touching for just a moment—and now she grabbed the pen, plunged rather than dipped it into the inkwell, and, crooking her index finger and laying her flushed head on her shoulder, wrote in her own clumsy hand, slanting upward from left to right: engaged on  september  to herr bendix grünlich, merchant from hamburg
there was such sincere anguish in his voice and in his face, such honesty and despair in his pleas…
had that been a heavy burden to bear?
the fresh idea, then-a matter of three, four bars, no more, is it not?
they’re young, but so much the better
frau stöhr wept with enthusiasm at the sight of what had once been joachim
a functional and useful theory of melody was boldly and quickly established
the covert words of these learned men
at least for now, that made the return home easier
he stood there, one hand holding the knot of his sailor’s tie against his chest, his tongue scouring a tooth that he did not trust, and listened to the earnest, subdued voices coming from the room
he agreed that the outbreak of war had meant a great improvement in the export of russian grain, mentioning that oats in particular had been imported on a grand scale for delivery to the army
still incensed, hans castorp asked if that was her husband there, and pointed to a gentleman with hunched shoulders sitting at the good russian table
what had been the date on the calendar of his first defiant departure?
he felt both excited and serious about his future profession
but from the start, there was not the least reason to give it a name; the furthest thing from his mind was ever to talk about the matter—that would have been most unlike him and he felt no need to do so
but they were undoubtedly at a disadvantage when wit and word and spirit were no longer at issue, and the topic turned to facts, to earthy, practical affairs, to those questions and things where masterful natures truly prove themselves
good heavens, mother, she said, i know one should not speak evil of one’s neighbor—i do, really
was that such an impossible hope?
you’ll suffer no further harm, i’m sure
her reddish, fashionably coiffed hair shone in the candlelight
he was carefully groomed as always, but he looked exhausted
all religious austerity is, of course, dispiriting for people of lesser stature
a postcard arrived from lake constance, in which james tienappel wrote that he had received a telegram requiring his immediate return to the plains on business
it was a common error, by the way, an error that could even bring about failure, to believe one had to concentrate one’s will and thoughts on the prospective phenomenon
that’s nice, the senator said, biting the mouthpiece of his cigarette—and said no more
sneezing was just as much fun—the way you felt it swelling up with a vengeance inside you, until it became irresistible and you breathed in and out in one great frenzy, gave yourself over to the bliss of it, your face drunk with pleasure—you could forget the whole world in one blessed eruption
he entered, and the brass bell above the door yelped like a vigilant puppy
the novel and dreadful thing about a decisive military defeat is the overturning of this idea, its physical refutation by a foreign ideology bound up, above all, with a foreign language-the total submis-
how pleased i was with her can be seen in my previous description of her
he left it to me to put questions to luca; indeed, he usually stepped away to look at something other than what was being discussed, leaving me alone with the apprentice
it was the return home from long, unspeakably painful wanderings, the correction of a great error, the loosening of tormenting chains, the removal of barriers—it set a horrible accident to rights again
at some level, i knew all along that i was making it up myself—the park, the trees, the sweet moist air, and all the rest, lovely or hideous—knew it ahead of time almost
who showed christian the door?
what do you mean?
he watched her intently, and the look on her face filled him with satisfaction—it was a look of disappointment
on those occasions when elisabeth was suffering from a migraine, it was madame grünlich’s task to look after the household and make up the menu
sometimes it would be followed by no utterance at all
the ineluctable recognition of hopeless doom is not synonymous with a denial of love
from eight till ten
most certainly not, thank god
the theory behind such a commonplace phenomenon as fever was self-contradictory
she pictured him and his tawny whiskers, his pink, smiling face, that wart beside his nose, his mincing steps; she thought she could feel his wool suit, hear his bland voice
he hadn’t seemed to listen; his eyes had set again, taking on that same fixed, vacant look
or did it seem to him just the opposite, that he had lived here now much, much longer than he really had?
it lay in his own hands to correct the situation
among other things, he spoke about romanticism and the fascinating duality of this early nineteenth-century european movement, before which both reactionary and revolutionary ideas fell, that is, all those that were not synthesized to something higher still
you would be right to speak thus, but lack courage or pretend its lack
he also noticed at once that her lack of fluency in his language meant she had to choose simple phrases to express her sympathy
seldom had one heard certain pieces by vivaldi, vieuxtemps, and spohr, or grieg's c-minor sonata, or even the kreutzer sonata and works by cesar franck played more impeccably
for his part, adrian, who for some reason-perhaps his short stature or his habitual headaches-had been excused from service indefinitely, intended to spend several weeks at buche!
if it should return, the doctor said-and he knew that it had to return within a few hours, since the easing of pressure brought about by tapping cerebral fluid would last only that long-they should apply the obligatory ice pack and give the chloral that he would prescribe and that was fetched from the county seat
this bare, hard room was ugly, despicable, and a whole morning full of a thousand ominous dangers lay leaden on his heart
at that moment he was universally despised
i’m sure this modest vintage will not be harmed if drunk from simpler vessels
in short, out of both love and fear, i suspected it of an aestheticism that cast the most tormenting doubts on my friend's statement that the antithesis that would replace bourgeois culture was not barbarism, but community
for from time to time she was subject to fits of anxious, whining panic, the result of her allegedly increasing listlessness and the upward curve of her fever chart
but joachim, likewise harboring the best of intentions and hoping to move their conversation harmlessly along, spoke up now—yet it sounded almost as if he did so under some pressure or duress, against his will, as it were
oh, what rotten, beastly luck!
when he finished, he laid his hands in his lap, a gloomy expression on his face
barrier to their public performance during his lifetime, especially since one of the songs, the merry musicians, is written for a whole quintet of voices: mother, daughter, two brothers, and the little boy who
hans castorp said nothing
but his body wanted things otherwise
you ca not tell me what pigment produces it, either
he then added: this bourn�e was more than a little characteristic of the playfully archaic element of conventional restraint, which contrasted so charmingly, and yet challengingly with the  modern,
mais apres tout, we are on german soil-indeed, how german, how homey and cozy, how full of character!
my temperature stands at a hundred degrees
she had suffered four severe hemorrhages over the last ten days, and her parents had come here with the idea of taking her back home while she still lived; but that did not appear to be a feasible plan—the director said that poor fräulein gerngross ought not to be moved
of course you must come along, he said, you and your wife
his grandfather was a carbonaro, which means charcoal-burner, by the way
ought there not be something embarrassing and depressing about that for me, an ordinary man?
pray note that you have actually lectured me only on the effects of hell, not, however, on what in point of fact and deed the damned have to expect there
what do you see in him?
luise ziemssen had the same beautiful, black, gentle eyes as joachim
around his neck hung the long gold watch chain that his grandfather had promised him, its fob a medallion that displayed the rather mournful family coat-of-arms: an irregularly hatched background, a bleak moor landscape, and a solitary, leafless willow beside a marsh
when it comes to music, your normally fine sense for what is banal fails you entirely
i don’t think he will ever be a soloist, she said to herr pfühl, and actually i’m quite glad about that, because it has its drawbacks
his mother raised her hand in protest
he now saw director behrens standing in front of a cupboard or built-in cabinet, his back to them as they entered; he was inspecting a blackish plate that he held out at arm’s length against the dull light of the ceiling lamp
herr settembrini listened attentively, his ankles crossed, his arms ditto, all the while daintily stroking the sweep of his moustache with his toothpick
no, peeperkorn’s desire for reality was rooted in something else: in fear, to put it quite bluntly—in his obsession with honor, in the zeal for duty that hans castorp had tried to explain to herr settembrini and wanted to declare as a kind of military trait
about the delay in my departure?
interest in it, only with
yes, those were stimulating hours, days, and weeks
his valet notified me after it was all over, she answered
she’s giving her doll a bath
well, it was long ago in any case
gerda buddenbrook allowed him do as he liked for a while, but at last she decided that he should be given piano lessons
whether explicitly or silently, you all ask that same question and acknowledge one another purely out of courtesy and for appearance'
among those who had found their way back from the social rooms in the wake of mr blue and miss silent was clavdia chauchat
as always, settembrini was wearing his heavy coat with the wide lapels, a frayed turndown collar, and checked trousers
he didn’t merely think it—he was so in earnest that he spoke it out loud
it will be recalled that in the old chapbook, which tells of the life and death of the grand magician and which, with a few resolute modifications of its chapters, leverkiihn arranged as the basis for the movements of his work, dr faustus, his hour-glass running out, invites his friends and trusted associates, magisters, baccalaurs, and other students to the village of rimlich near wittenberg, entertains them liberally there by day, and by night as well, drinking with them a st john's farewell, and then, in a contrite but dignified speech makes known his fate and announces its imminent fulfillment
i stopped and stared at him, though that did not matter to him
i was fairly sure all along, but what you said there at the end betrayed you
since the onset of winter, his fever chart had been curving upward, and director behrens had mentioned something about injections that he liked to give for chronic high temperature and which two-thirds of the guests, including joachim, regularly received
i’ve never seen it, but i’ve heard that’s how primitive tribes do it, celebrating the first night of summer, which is actually the beginning of autumn—the year’s high noon, its zenith, and it’s all downhill from there
those will do the trick
this ignorance or brashness proved more useful to him than all else, because the floating rhythm made some of his compositions, particularly those
silence and order were quickly established
i’ve been sitting all along
the measles had left him with that same strong need for sleep that very small children have, and he frequently yielded to it wherever he might happen to be, even outside the hours set apart for an afternoon nap
that’s your true pedagogue—he himself said not long ago that he had a pedagogic streak
i don’t know why it offends me so much—though i’m not saying, jean, that the july monarchy isn’t a fine thing…
of course, it’s in your best interest to have me believe that the others are as calm and trusting as ever
anton is gone on the wings of the storm, like a shot!
frau stöhr, however, who happened to be sitting not all that far from the trio, had apparently abandoned herself to the film; her red, uneducated face was contorted with pleasure
he asked, his voice wavering on the edge
and so a potbellied and knock-kneed king heinrich in lohengrin had to serve as the butt of ridicule-with that round, black hole of a mouth in a doormat of a beard through which he let spill his rumbling bass
do you need a shove?
it means that i belong to a fraternity in göttingen—and now you know
you will not deny it to me, i know
in reality, however, they were one, were united in their opposition to life, to the bourgeoisiosity of life, to ethics, reason, virtue; they were the single religious principle that they represented together
the academic life keeps one young and frisky
i am not indifferent to the lass-but you do not like that word-to the girl, then, to marie
he spent some time beside the bridge table, where the incurable herr albin, his mouth drooping at the corners, played his cards with a worldly nonchalance
at a real premiere, everyone must leap up from their seats at several points during the evening, and while the majority roars, 'insulte!
he stammered on for a while in an attempt to plead his cause
as for the rest, it would all be over with no consequences, for better or worse, in another week and a half, when he would enter training with tunder and wilms
all in all, it had something of the education of a princeling about it, and i recall that i used that very term when teasing my friend, and also recall how he gave his peculiar curt laugh and turned his head aside, as if he would have preferred not to hear it
if so, hans castorp thought it was very forced mockery, because his uncle had definitely not been in a mood for jests or mockery when he rushed off like that, but rather had come to the profound realization—and had turned pale with fright picturing it to himself—that upon his return to the flatlands, after a stay of only eight days, everything down there would seem totally false, unnatural, and wrong for a good while, that instead of heading off to his office after breakfast, he ought to take a short constitutional, then ritually wrap himself in blankets, and assume a horizontal position in the open air
they sat there for a few minutes, during which the consul and the broker spoke by turns
she cried when she admitted it to me
then there was the problem of the ground-floor rooms on meng strasse, which would soon stand empty, because the senator planned to move his offices to fischer grube as well; but that issue was soon solved nicely, for it turned out that the municipal fire insurance company was prepared to rent the space for their offices
have we perhaps reached a decision?
specialists have assured me that it’s the case with me
that’s quite, quite, quite funny
so, then, have a good trip and give my best to your good father, the consul, and his wife
it was a proximity based solely on illness; all the same, joachim had a great deal of military integrity about him—though, granted, without his even being aware of it, that integrity was being increasingly satisfied by rest cures, to the point where they had become, as it were, a substitute for duties fulfilled in the flatlands, a kind of spurious occupation
you will have to admit that her movements are totally restricted
and then lavishes kisses upon the corpse from the sole of its feet to the crown of its head, so that her knights, disconcerted by such exaggerated sorrow, feel compelled to pull their mistress off the dead man
not only was he repeatedly far too candid about his relationship with inez, but he also went too far in a different direction, culpably and impishly far-seduced by the darkness might i say, if the term seduction may seem properly employed
and he had known how to spread his theory among the public—among other methods, by writing popular articles that he had then passed on to the press
bending forward, he moved his spoon through his soup, letting his little, round, deep-set eyes drift to the head of the table now and then
you’ll have to explain that for me
but he now blithely started in with it again and backed off (without taking any offense, by the way) only after adrian refused a second or third time to respond accordingly
that’s a display put on by the skin’s sebaceous glands, which give off the skin’s oils, a kind of protein-rich, fatty secretion, you know—not exactly appetizing, but it keeps the skin supple, so that it doesn’t dry out and crack or break and remains pleasant to the touch
god was indeed gracious, despite dr grabow’s pronouncement that the birth was somewhat too early, and even though matters had not stood at the best beforehand and bethsy endured great pain
while joachim was eating his breakfast downstairs, hans castorp would sit up, pillows stuffed behind his back, and do the same, with the healthy appetite that a change in life can bring—and would be disturbed hardly at all by the bustling, businesslike invasion of the doctors, who by this time had passed through the dining hall and were now making their rounds, moving at double time through the rooms of the bedridden and moribund
yes, in point of fact, we need to get moving there
laundry baskets full of clothes and linens are being carried out of the house
it was fun—he stood there for a long time, just trying out this little optical phenomenon over and over
i’m not saying, of course, that your good mother will be taking a stroll tomorrow morning, dr grabow went on meekly
for there could be no mistaking two obvious facts: first, joachim was approaching death with his mind clear; and second, he did so contentedly and at peace with himself
so you see, it is a good thing to have reliable friends after all
you shall hear from me
joachim, too, after first gazing at his cousin in astonishment, hastened to assure the director that it would indeed be very kind of him
damn if i don’t
it is a miscalculation; by the light of cold day, it is as impossible as the thing itself, which would be immediately evident if nature rescinded that impossibility even once; and what we call mourning is perhaps not so much the pain of the impossibility of ever seeing the dead return to life, as the pain of not being able to wish it
this would have meant withholding from what was created the free will to turn away from god-which would have been an imperfect creation, indeed not a creation of and an externality apart from god at all
but just imagine, mama, yesterday, on theatiner strasse, some high dignitary of the church rode past me in his carriage, he might have been the archbishop, an older man—well, the man leered at me from his carriage window as if he were a lieutenant of the guard
and ’cause she was so cute
another was the trip to the shore that he took with schildknapp, the fruit of which, one can say,
hans castorp disputed this emphatically—his cousin was talking almost like settembrini, with no respect or reverence for suffering
at the same time, however, he realized with terrible clarity what was happening now
and a crazy, preposterous idea rose up inside him, a wild hope based in his fanciful belief that with god nothing was impossible, despite all the men in worsted suits in the world
there were problems, he said—the lieutenant’s days up here were numbered and the engineer would now be doubling his efforts at rest cure in order to follow his cousin back down to the plains soon
when, one day, then, his children returned from a trip to west prussia with this young girl—she was only just twenty—bringing her into the house like some baby jesus, an orphan, the daughter of an innkeeper who had died just before the buddenbrooks’ arrival, the consul’s act of christian charity had resulted in an outburst, during which the old gentleman spoke almost nothing but french and plattdeutsch
and on the spot he declared little elly to be a cunning fraud
the candles were burning slowly, slowly lower, and now and then, when their flames flickered to one side, the faint odor of wax drifted over the table
well, my name is morten, he said, and blushed redder than ever
i flatter myself that in general i have not left these gentlemen with the impression that i am an exploiter and their moral inferior; indeed, i’ve run across some who drive a much harder bargain than i but it took just one little bold stroke, which i shall now tell you about, to bring me a bit closer on the social scale to one such fellow
and speak right out
it was a democracy of banquet tables, to put it bluntly
she found nothing more elegant than a tasteful negligee, and since she had never been permitted to give free rein to this passion in her parents’ home, she indulged herself all the more as a married woman
but one day, when left in the room with hans castorp and her patient, who definitely was not asleep, but lying on his back with his eyes open, she blithely remarked, i never would have dreamed it, either—that i would be nursing one of you gentlemen to the bitter end
and at the sound of that voice, little johann raised his golden-brown eyes and fixed them—larger, clearer, and more loving than ever before—on his father’s face, with its reddened eyelids beneath pale brows and its white, slightly puffy cheeks behind the long tips of the stiff mustache
he was beyond happy
the green ribbons of her bonnet were draped over her childlike shoulders, and she had to lift one of those shoulders very high whenever she wanted to make a gesture with her arm above the level of the tabletop; at age seventy-five, she was thinner than ever
gentlemen, dr langhals, the presiding chairman, said after a while, in a subdued voice audible to the whole assembly, i assume i have your consent to open this meeting?
he cast the winning costumes one quick glance, and then his lips grew very thin beneath the lovely upward sweep of his moustache
and what didn’t fall to herr kistenmaker’s excess of zeal was ruined by old herr marcus’s procrastination
it was between the beginning and the middle of february of a new year
the spiral staircase down to the bathroom is amusing, i grant
that was normal—no one was fond of anniversaries of arrival
you tend to take your jokes more seriously than your serious statements
look there, i call that advancement o n your part
mother’s house, this house was that little marked-off spot for me, tom
all the more intense, then, was my satisfaction upon receiving this letter from the office in lugano
he was its source-the curse, however, was intended for the object
but when she came back to him, one had little doubt that he had ever left her mind for a moment
he had a bad feeling about this
the main thing is that above the positive law of nation-states there arises a universal law with a higher jurisdiction, which allows disputed questions between parties to be settled by courts of arbitration
wasn’t clavdia right to feel excused from writing, simply because her illness gave her that freedom?
the traces of what had befallen consul buddenbrook’s daughter grew more and more blurred, both in town and in the family
beg your pardon, but that is not all
but tony laid her knife down and cried, just tell me straight out, papa, please!
i was quite sure, her mother said, that we would be open to quiet words of reason
the achievements that the renaissance and the enlightenment wrested from the past—and may i emphasize, my dear sir, the struggles contained in that verb—were individual human personality, human rights, and human freedom
i know very well that there are two or three other people here in town—all of them women, i believe—who could instruct him, but they are mere piano teachers
madame möllendorpf immediately reached for her lorgnette
so in my eyes at least, your catarrh is merely a tertiary phenomenon, dr krokowski had added very nonchalantly
a very aristocratic sort, with a square monocle clamped in his eye—i could never figure out why he didn’t cut himself—wore patent-leather boots and carried a riding crop with a gold handle
i’d be lying if i said i didn’t
there was someone in my life whose stout-hearted perseverance overcame death, one can almost say, who freed the humanity within me, who taught me happiness
still others were fishing
what do you have against the body?
ah, and the catastrophes by which free thought hopes to prove its own vitality—ah, those latter-day, spectacular triumphs for which it prepares itself and which it dreams of someday celebrating!
here, stand between the portieres
dry his chin, my child—here, take my napkin
not that i would want for the world to insult you, my good joachim, or your zealot’s love of duty
how could i not?
in any case, i have already had a few words today with gosch, the old broker
you have to eat right, you know
yes, you can put it that way
nor do i know whether he let himself be won over on that occasion
despite which, one ought not to imagine him as peevish; on the contrary, he was very funny, sometimes even foolish, gifted with a veritable anglo-saxon sense of humor and a personality that the english would surely call boyish
such an idea ought never to enter my head, i know, but you’ve left me no choice but to think that is whom you mean, tony
herr settembrini spoke very graphically, very drolly, about the father in the corner
it is ever flattering, ever beneficial
in those years, school life is life itself; it embodies life; its interests form the horizon that every life needs in order to develop values, however relative those may be, by which character and abilities prove themselves
and so, gradually, a general mood began to spread through the town, and its effects soon reached the widow buddenbrook’s household itself—at first much to her amazement and dismay, and then to her growing indignation
employing all the powers of my imagination, i could not credit this thoroughly fussy and self-absorbed man-whose frame, io be sure, was delicate and exquisite, but physically quite unimposing (he even had a mincing gait, by the way)-with any appeal for the opposite sex; whereas i felt that inez, despite all her reserved virginal austerity, ultimately needed just such appeal
through their quartz windows the travelers now stared out into a blue-black difficult to describe but perhaps best compared to the duskiness along the horizon of a sky swept by fohn winds
grünlich has set up the big green card table—there are all kinds of papers and pencils on it—where you’re supposed to have a conference with him and kesselmeyer
and when the high priest mentions that radames has nothing to say, they unanimously agree he is guilty of treason
all the same, it was in love’s service, naphta declared, that machinery was set in motion by which the cloister cleansed the world of its wicked citizens
perhaps she did not even remember any of it
well, and where are we then?
yes, that was pribislav
are hermetically sealed preserves on the shelf outside of time?
in the end-no, beg your pardon, not n the end, but before all else-your homo dei is really a piece of gruesome nature with a not exactly generously allotted quantum of potential for spiritualization
each time he performed the task, sweat beaded up underneath his unruly blond curls and the whites of his pretty cornflowerblue eyes were netted with red veins
'voice' is a very good word, for it reminds us that music was song long before it was anything else-first one voice and then many-and that the chord is the result of polyphonic singing; and that means counterpoint, means an interweaving of independent voices that, to a certain degree and according to changeable laws of tastes, show regard for each other
early services are just starting, but we shall lift our hearts and praise god in the glory of nature, isn’t that right, herr permaneder?
the panes of both windows were almost opaque with fog, and only blurred, naked trees and shrubs were still visible outside
some garden, hanno said and began to laugh
but i ask you, what is there to stand in the way?
then she came back around to her papa and her cousin
well, at least we can hope, joachim said, that you’ve recuperated here with us and will feel refreshed once you’re back down
ida sat down next to her, picked up her needle and the darning egg with the stocking stretched over it, and, with her head bent low, the smooth gray hair pulled back tight, and following her stitches with unwearying shiny brown eyes, said, do you think he’ll ask tomorrow?
of the screaming, writhing torture of a child-of this child, who folds his trembling little hands and stammers, echo will be good, echo will be good !
the tips of his fingers stung and were so swollen that there was no point in trying to use his nail brush
then he went on drumming, stamping his feet now, howling, i won’t
and so this time, too, all voices unite in the verdict of treason!
but they decided on the traditional sum of , marks courant
about morality as well!
this was at a house on mythen strasse, near the lake, the home of herr and frau reiff, a wealthy, childless couple well along in years, lovers of the arts who had always enjoyed entertaining prominent touring artists and offering them a tasteful refuge
and it will be a whole new travemünde, right on front row with the schwarzkopfs
but it would only have been a wild departure
they both climbed in, and the carriage rolled off through the streets
when he used his handkerchief, he found red traces of blood, but he did not have the energy to think much about it, although he was easily inclined to worry about himself and tended by nature to play the hypochondriac
do not lose yourself in an alien world
he opened the door when he heard a soft, anguished come in, and found frau permaneder, still completely dressed, lying atop the down quilt that covered her bed; the bed-curtains had been pulled back, and there was a bottle of digestive tonic on the nightstand beside her
or something of that sort
which, of course, put an end to joachim’s exuberance
yes, that’s a good idea
several berghof residents studied esperanto and had learned enough to converse in the artificial lingo at meals
it’s the same as if there were a splotch of ink on this page
and even today, among the uneducated, this morel was thought to be an aphrodisiac
he demonstrated for us the fingering on a clarinet and on a seven-holed bassoon, whose sound, with its twelve closed and four open keys, blends so nicely with that of the horns; he taught us about the range of the instruments, how they are played, and much more
i am well aware that he would like me to surrender myself entirely to polyhymnia
rather than attempting a portrait of my darling subject, i shall probably do more for him by confessing that even today, a good seventeen years later, tears well up in my eyes at the thought of him, and at the same time i am filled with a fundamentally strange, ethereal, not quite earthly joy and serenity
for remarkably enough, he also wrote on its tilted surface, very like erasmus in holbein's portrait
in any case, the added emotional experience of observing the patient from mannheim was almost too much for a man like poor hans castorp to have to deal with all at once
half sweet, half buttermilk, dieckmann
he started all over again—and then suddenly broke off
after wandering in confusion and vague ecstasy, the sounds would then sink back down, sobbing and fainting, into night and stillness
i note that first and foremost, but am very well aware, my good man, of what lies hid behind it
but now, standing beside the mother who had rushed here from elsewhere, he looked at his cousin with her eyes, as it were, as if he had not seen him for a long time, and saw clearly and distinctly what she doubtless also recognized and joachim certainly knew better than either of them: that he was a moribundus
but no, thank god, his head was turned in the other direction and he was just preaching away in general across the throng of worshipers; and yet it was only too clear that this was a new assault and that every word was meant for her
he realized he was talking to himself—and saying rather strange things at that
he was grateful beyond bounds for the respect shown his origins, his infant christian faith, his personal status in general
but then, to be sure, had come the great fugue overture, opus   and the majestic fugues in the gloria and credo of the missa solemnis, proof at last that in wrestling with this angel the great combatant had remained the victor here, too, though departing perhaps halting upon his thigh
he was frequently confined to his bed, and not just on the days when his quartan fever went about its foul work
i don’t need a son
it was just like in the municipal theater—almost even more beautiful
the emotional circumstances we have been describing exacerbated the man’s illness beyond measure; and since he could not fail to encounter forms of life here that displayed the imperfection of which he, wiedemann, was free, those same circumstances led to a dreadful scene that hans castorp witnessed and that shall have to serve as one more example of what we are describing
for is not that fledgling moment of dawning freedom, when the school door closes behind us, when the shell of the town in which
you have to be awfully careful not to say one word too many, otherwise you’ll get an extensive lecture
i bore it all and didn’t grumble
preparatory examination negative, dr krokowski announced
fine, it’s not permitted in cases like ours, we can’t handle that—which is understandable, and so as a reasonable man you reconcile yourself to the fact
madame buddenbrook had sighed her last, very brief, and peaceful sigh, the bearers had lifted her flower-bedecked coffin to carry it awkwardly from the dining room, where the funeral service had been held—but his mood did not change, he never wept once; what remained was that gentle, perplexed shake of the head, and curious became his favorite word, repeated with something almost like a smile
the room assigned him-immediately to the right of the entrance and facing the quiet street-had appealed to him because it was tidy and practically but comfortably furnished, and he had quickly put it in perfect order with the addition of his personal belongings, his books and notes
my dear father, for heaven’s sake, calm down
well, give it some thought, thomas
that could happen easily enough—it was a smooth tabletop, the edge of the glass was nicely ground, and the pressure exerted by their trembling fingers, light as it was, would of course be uneven, more vertical here, more from the side there, so that in time it would be quite sufficient to cause the glass to leave its middle position
everything i’ve ever tried to do has gone wrong and ended in misfortune
he has buddenbrook hands—and buddenbrooks can span ninths or tenths
let it stand as it is
it’s not a complete physical, but behrens pounds around a little on you and has krokowski jot down some notes
it all comes to me, i say
she did not trust this illness, and was most definitely not inclined to lie back in her bed and idly let matters take their course
and then everyone moved forward to shake hands once again with the dead woman’s sons and brother
herr grünlich waited in his long-tailed coat and silk vest outside the door
i truly like measuring my temperature four times a day, because it makes you notice what one minute, or even seven, actually means—especially since the seven days of a week hang so dreadfully heavy on your hands here
and hans castorp replied nonchalantly, nothing new
she whistled from her stomach as she passed me by
i have only this to say yet
before this dog so lowly;
it’s one of the things naphta and settembrini argue about
he has trouble concentrating, and gets tired quickly
i don’t want this, i want it boiling hot
i beg you to drink with me, to quaff our glasses down to the last drop, arm in arm
and his grandfather, who had already pushed back the long, soft flap of his frock coat and pulled a bundle of keys from his trouser pocket, now opened the china cabinet, from whose interior rose a fragrance the boy found both strange and pleasant
one could in fact forget completely just where one is
i call this light touch refreshing, because it was so much a part of his lifeblood that, in fact, it instilled in one the amusingly comforting sense that one unnecessarily took life all too seriously
and, to cap it all, pfiffi, with a little jiggle and drops of moisture at the corners of her mouth, would comment on the child’s extraordinary resemblance to that swindler grünlich
having spent her last years tormented by gout, she had passed on gently, simply, firm in her childish faith and envied by her educated sister, who still had to do battle with rationalist doubts now and then, and who, although she had grown ever more hunchbacked and tiny, was bound to this sinful earth by a rugged constitution
or ho!—he would hop about in a kind of dance, and tony would make him dance the moment she spotted him
he had not wanted to disturb his nephew—a white lie
herr kesselmeyer followed the course of these two drops with intense interest; he even raised himself up a little to stare openmouthed directly into grünlich’s face
homely edification on the faces of the women
should it be your state solely?
for we do not see ourselves as hans castorp’s eulogist and want to leave room for the suggestion that, for him, work was simply something that stood in the way of the unencumbered enjoyment of a maria mancini
gazing at me, not you
they went even further
i urgently request the reader, by the way, to credit what i have said here with such feeling to my authorial account and not to believe it represents leverkiihn's thoughts
but once the old masters had been given their due, his partner no longer had to coerce him into the more complicated hand positions and he would glide easily into the vital, subtle weaving of leitmotifs, though always with a look of embarrassment and something close to anger in his eyes
yes, he would be late, there was no question of that now
evidently and by his own admission, the man was living at the time in a state of high tension, in which invention definitely did not simply cheer, but also harried and enthralled him, in which the flash of a problem as it posed itself-that is, the cqmpositional task as he had pursued it from the start-was as one with the illumination of its solution, barely leaving him time to put his quill, his pen to a rush of ideas that gave him no rest, made him their slave
otherwise i’d be lying out on my balcony after my evening meal, too
i have seen quite a bit of the world, and i have lived among far too many different kinds of people, with far too many different customs, for me to—and i’m a grown man in any case, he suddenly shouted
hans castorp had no time to concern himself with the titles naphta had bestowed upon herr settembrini
urged on by frau stöhr, who had now joined them, they stopped by the kurhaus café just to please karen, who clasped her hands together in gratitude
the whole room was fragrant with lightly singed evergreen boughs and glowed and sparkled with the light of countless little flames; the sky-blue wallpaper with its white statues of gods made the large room look even brighter
she still cried just as she had as a child—openly and without any posturing
it seems to me that as my brother you should assume more or less the position of chief clerk that he held before, at least in a representative sense, for appearance’s sake
and, of course, salt water does smart on chafed skin, so he probably got in the habit of using cold cream while he was in the service, that doesn’t seem at all peculiar to me
the back building had vanished entirely, and in its place rose a new trim, airy structure with several large, high-ceilinged storage rooms and shops that fronted on becker grube
in wittenberg or on the wartburg, even in leipzig i would have thought you credible
herr köppen said commliments again
thousands of them darken the skies of this brashly united continent, and more and more of our cities collapse in ruin
and what followed now were the strangest hours our hero’s young life had ever known until then; and although we are not completely sure as to his later fate, although we shall lose sight of him at a certain point in our story, we would like to think that they remained the strangest hours he would ever experience
and since, moreover, given such widespread wickedness, there was sore need for an example to be set, the two witches, old and young, were publicly burned at adjacent stakes
i chanced to spot a lass
of course he should have said: of nuremberg
maybe you’d be able to whistle, too, if you really set your mind to it, after all it must be something you can learn
then, turning to his assembled relatives, he said seriously, if perhaps a little perfunctorily, my heartfelt thanks to you all, my dear family
one might imagine such a lad spurring a horse on or swimming in a bay, strolling along the shore with a girlfriend, his lips pressed to his gentle beloved’s ear, or in happy friendship instructing another lad to string a bow
they were waiting for the old woman’s brother, consul justus kröger, who had been sent for as well
so, let’s forget it, kai, and now you can tell a story
triflings and trumpery !
his manners were not quite perfect, and his conversation was frankly clumsy
all we lack are a couple of palm trees to put at my wife’s bay window, and a few suitable oil paintings, which i’ll look around for
it was to the right of the lobby, directly across from the social rooms, and was used, as joachim explained, primarily for new arrivals or residents who either had missed a regularly scheduled meal or had visitors
this passed, and he was working again by early august    , and before that month of a great many very hot, sunny days had ended, the oratorio was completed
life in prison had not affected hugo weinschenk’s physical health—he had always been a man of rugged constitution
a pony … no … i … petersen stammered
that’s fine, marcus, and my hearty thanks for your willingness to assume some of the responsibilities that otherwise might prove too much for me, thomas responded quickly, and casually offered his partner a hand across the table—for the matter had been settled for some time, and all this was a mere formality
but with or without a reason for them, these feelings, though far from having a name or being shared, were so powerful that hans castorp carried them silently about with him for almost a year—approximately a year, since it was impossible to fix their beginnings exactly—which at least spoke for the loyalty and steadfastness of his character, particularly when one thinks what a huge chunk of time a year is at that age
that was a major blunder, he admitted
but it had been inevitable
it came in whispers
but any child could have seen from his mother’s eyes that she was totally conscious and aware of everything
i’m figuring, the consul said dryly
you cannot pretend that i had anything to do with your waiting—if indeed you did wait—that i encouraged you to wait, or even gave you permission to do so
joachim, too, was somewhat embarrassed
the salon, the columned hall, the landscape room, and the corridor were crowded with mourners as pastor pringsheim from st mary’s delivered the eulogy by the light of flickering candles; he stood erect and majestic at the head of the casket, and his clean-shaven face, its expression ranging from solemn fanaticism to mild transfiguration, was turned toward heaven—floating above his wide, pleated ruff and a pair of hands folded just under his chin
you’ve waited this long …
but knock softly, don’t startle her
the least breath of air brushing the trees made the tinsel shudder and tinkle in metallic whispers
but today that firm is shaky, and b grünlich is the shakiest of the shaky
he could not think of the lawyer, moreover, without being reminded of fränzchen oberdank, the smoothly coiffed lady’s companion and housemaid who had recently been brought up here by her mother, a very dignified provincial lady
to your health, lodovico—i wish you long life
i feel sick, kai, little johann said
it is also the element of music, which itself measures and divides time, making it suddenly diverting and precious; and related to music, as we have noted, is the story, which also can only present itself in successive events, as movement toward an end (and not as something suddenly, brilliantly present, like a work of visual art, which is pure body bound to time), and even if it would try to be totally here in each moment, would still need time for its presentation
but he gave hanno everything he had to give as presents: marbles, wooden tops, even his small, battered tin pistol—his finest possession
and form, too, comes only from love and goodness: form and the cultivated manners of man’s fair state, of a reasonable, genial community—out of silent regard for the bloody banquet
yes, and then we’ll walk up to that same bench from this morning
his researches, dedicated to psychic dissection and the dream life of his patients, had always had a subterranean character, the whiff of the catacomb
but they knew that this was his favorite pose, and so someone had spilled ink on the spot, and herr modersohn’s little, clumsy hand was now stained black
in particular thomas enjoyed his imitation of herr marcellus stengel, who worked very hard at instructing his students in singing, drawing, and similar diverting disciplines
he looked around him now, delighting as always in this boldly intimate spot, which even under these icy conditions was no less beautiful than during the season of blue blossoms
and he jumped up, leaned against the wall, and pressed the back of his head against the wainscoting
the tea you brought me is ice-cold
hans castorp had never seen the phenomenon before, had never believed it could really occur—but herr wiedemann’s hair stood up stiff and straight as nails
i am speaking of morten schwarzkopf, who intends to become a doctor and, as soon as he is one, to ask for my hand
an unhappy poet of my country, a hunchbacked, sickly man with a soul—a large soul originally, but one forever humbled by the misery of his body and dragged to the lower depths of irony, a soul that could produce laments to rend the heart
she adjusted the lamp and pulled the large bible over to her—the gilt on its immense embossed cover faded with age
one of the finest of the age, a master of our tongue, few could match him, and a stylist in latin, the like of which there is none today, a uomo letterato to warm boccaccio’s heart
i was truly embarrassed for him
what you are preaching is pragmatism, settembrini responded, and you need only transfer it to the political realm to perceive how totally destructive it is
joachim began without further ado to strip to the waist
when i have paid him, he wishes me a hearty appetite and turns tail
he said, sitting up taller against the cushioned back, but immediately slumping again a little to one side
her whole body, from her crown to the sole of her feet, was apparently overcome by terrible restlessness, by unspeakable panic and agony, by an inescapable sense of abandonment and hopelessness without end
he cast a glance at senator buddenbrook and herr gosch, and since the two gentlemen were deep in conversation, he drew his chair closer to frau permaneder’s spot on the sofa, and bent toward her until she could hear his nose puffing heavily very near her own
he, too, had spruced up his appearance a little for mardi gras, for in addition to his white clinical smock, which, as a man ever on professional call, he wore today as always, he had donned a genuine turkish fez, scarlet red with a black tassel dangling over one ear—costume enough to lend his already striking appearance an even more curious and outlandish look
no, not to people who have no dignity, morals, ambition, elegance, or discipline, not to impolite, unkempt, slovenly people, people who are lazy and frivolous, sluggish and superficial all at the same time
but one can’t speak of boredom, because boredom comes with the passing of time—and that would be a paradox in relation to eternity
only a misanthrope could christen the lack of the word—raw, mute reality itself—with such a name
she was sixteen or seventeen years old
a bad case of the sniffles appeared to be in the making
individualism was romantically medieval in its belief in the infinite, cosmic importance of each single creature, from which came the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, the theory of geocentrism, and astrology
hans castorp ate, meanwhile suppressing the tremor of his head
considerably exceeds the disquieting number of pages in the one on kretzschmar's lectures
she’s in her room
he shouted in a booming voice that made the room ring and sent frau permaneder sobbing to one corner of the sofa
i wouldn’t go so far as to say that the natural order—the size of the earth, for instance, or the time it takes for it to turn on its axis or orbit the sun, the alternation of day and night, the change of seasons, the rhythm of the cosmos, if you like—that all that has been measured out to suit our needs
don’t make fun of me, tom
does it not seem as if the archaized tone had fulfilled its purpose as soon as the story of being led astray was put to paper, as if from then on the tone'was abandoned not only because it did not fit the ruse of those final observations, but also because, starting with the dating, that tone had been introduced solely in order to tell the story in it, to give the tale its appropriate atmosphere?
she asked, pronouncing the word in a strange, clipped way
the heavy red curtains at the windows had been closed, and in each corner of the room eight candles burned in a tall, gold-plated candelabrum, not to mention those in silver branched candlesticks on the table
that concern is only too justified, for your humanism is done with, you may be assured of that—over and done with
and as for his vows, there is such a thing as mental reservation
he gazed down at his plate, his eyes swimming with tears
he had spent a summer near snow hill back then, and one friday evening, the beginning of the sabbath, he had ridden over just to play the onlooker outside these pious people's house of worship
as if progress, to the extent such a thing existed, was not due solely to illness, or better, to creative genius, which was one and the same thing as illness
the word of the apostle, 'he who seeketh hard things shall have it hard
veiled in a black cashmere scarf, her knees slightly bent, she was strolling aimlessly in long, restless strides; and her aging face, with its large, careworn mouth, shimmered dull white against the black veil she had wound around her silver-streaked hair and tied beneath her chin
correct, impeccably neat, and elegant, he walked along breite strasse with his characteristic, slightly skipping gait and was constantly forced to greet people as he went
herr permaneder moved into meng strasse and dined the following day with thomas buddenbrook and his wife; the next day, a thursday, he became acquainted with justus kröger and his wife, with the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse, who found him dradfully funny—they said dradfully—and with sesame weichbrodt, who was rather stern with him, as well as with poor klothilde and little erika, whom he gave a sack of horehound, by which he meant candy
his regal face, encircled by white flames, was flushed, and little beads of moisture stood out on his brow and upper lip
it seemed everything to him, in fact, except how it really was—always presuming, of course, that time is part of nature and that it is therefore permissible to see it in conjunction with reality
in brief, it is true that i visit him, that he visits me, that we take our strolls together
the undersigned wish to make the following statement:
i know that your father has had some rather painful losses—due, as we all are aware, to your brother, justus
but when i recall the grotesque anecdote of how those two saviors of european civilization, the german and the italian (and both
well, fare thee well and much obliged, the one said to the other in a deep, guttural voice; he now switched his axe to his other shoulder and began to stride down toward the valley, his steps cracking loudly as he forged a path through the pines
his own tray would be brought in
this then, in passing, is a description of nepo schneidewein, of
you can’t imagine what it means to grow old, he said
poor klothilde came—gray, patient, and gaunt—paid no attention to the teasing, and drank four cups of coffee, offering words of praise for everything in her usual amiable drawl
and all the while his old disorder—the one that dr grabow had diagnosed as pavor nocturnus—continued—indeed, grew worse
she had not been listening, not outside, not at the door, truly she hadn’t
was it a struggle with death?
the breadbasket was trimmed with pearl embroidery, the handiwork of meta, who was sitting beside her mother, a polite little eight-year-old in a plaid frock and with flaxen hair tied up in a stiff pigtail
of a freelance career
he might be acquitted in a large city, perhaps
he grew—despite miserable weather, despite wind and fog—grew up, one might say, in his yellow mackintosh, and on the whole was a quite cheerful lad
the renaissance as the origin of the deification of the state?
as for me, you know, i love freedom above all else—especially the freedom to choose my place of residence
i feel i can speak openly to you
yes, there you sit offering me your condescending advice, the wretched man replied, and have no idea how much insult there is in your consolation, that you only humiliate me all the more with it
i was sure he would treat them more or less the way he had treated his winfried brothers in halle, but when i remarked how pleased i was that he had quickly made some good connections in leipzig, he simply replied, well, connections
i don’t want it
he passed away last night, the consul said with emotion and grasped the hand in which his brother was holding an umbrella
do it in just the same way, he commanded, and signaled for hans castorp to replace him
he rolled over now so that he was lying close beside her on his stomach; and, propping himself on his elbows, he took one of her hands in his, and his kindly steel-blue eyes gazed deep into hers with rapturous fervor
i simply ca not help it, adrian, believe me, you must believe me!
well, the man was capable of devoting one entire hour to the question, why did not beethoven write a third movement for his last piano sonata, opus i i i ?-a topic worth discussing, without doubt
; one finds frequent use of suspension, if only as a rhythmic device, melodic chromaticism, fearful collective silence at the start of a phrase, repetitions like those in the lasciatemi,  the drawing-out of syllables, falling intervals, fading declamation-amid enormous contrast effects like the tragic entrance of the choir, a cappella and at full voice, that immediately follows faust's descent into hell (itself an orchestral piece of grand ballet music, a galop of fantastic rhythmic variety) and is an overwhelming eruption of lamentation after an orgy of infernal gaiety
seated among the germans and swiss were bearded, elegant russians, looking barbarically rich, and dutchmen with traces of malayan blood—all intermixed with a sprinkling of indeterminate sorts who spoke french and came from the balkans or the levant, a motley set of adventurers for whom hans castorp had a certain weakness but whom joachim spurned as dubious and lacking in character
how are you feeling, hanno?
nothing, the pianist answered with a quick shake of his head, a gesture that looked more as if he were shooing a fly
i have a legal right to lie here and dream such things
ida asked, and frau permaneder came closer, too, trying to understand his troubled muttering and stammering
and the director had followed schiller in calling nature god and innate talents the merits of god on our behalf, which we were to bear in humility
did you think: i’ll marry my stüwing because i love her, and hang the practical considerations—those are nothing but petty, philistine details’?
that was what he found truly unbearable, the way the lieutenant avoided him completely, refusing almost every official invitation and preferring instead the easy and private company of his wife
madame antonie is simply more vivacious, he went on, suddenly striking a lighter tone
fine, my dear friend
and shall i now say that for me personally, as loath as i was, as always, to leave adrian's side, the departure from the manardi house was likewise bound up with a certain secret sense of relief?
december passed, and then, early in january of ’, the wedding took place
it doesn’t really fit the rest, does it?
go on, i shouted
consul buddenbrook was deeply moved
but it was what they now sang to each other, or at times with one another, concerning this situation, interrupted now and then by the muffled tones of the ceremonies several stories above—it was this exchange of song that deeply stirred the soul of the lonely, nocturnal listener, both in regard to the situation and its musical expression
he cheerfully showed his lodgings to his young friends, called them private and cozy, thereby supplying them with the right words by which they could then praise his quarters—which they did in unison
it’s really very awful
damn if i’m not more tired and flushed than i’ve ever been
more or less, the italian said curtly, turning his head away and swinging his cane
in two or three hasty, soundless, powerful moves, the bier was on their shoulders, and before anyone had time to realize the shock of the moment, the flower-covered casket swayed through the room at a steady, deliberate pace and vanished into the columned hall
like most of the guests, they were shaving fifteen minutes from the main rest cure by lingering over coffee and cognac
then we’ll have a little bankruptcy, a very funny little bankruptcy, my friend
shivering and dizzy, he would be overcome with a kind of numb intoxication that left his head flushed and hot
not everyone offered her the opportunity
and yet, in its way it’s an apt expression, seems to me
damn, but he had felt the surge of his own energy, and as the energy, so the ideal, to quote feuerbach
the tendency toward musical prose reaches its height in the string quartet, perhaps leverkiihn's most esoteric work, which followed on the heels of the ensemble piece
and in any case, one was just either on the basis of one given standpoint or on the basis of the other
'because you wo not amount to much, hallelujah!
oh, oh, enough, all so undeserved—what a bliss of light, of deep pure sky, of sun-drenched water
let no one think i am poking fun!
all of you want nothing to do with one another
he pushed on, moving ever higher, skyward
when the senate met to divide committee assignments among its members, taxation was designated as his primary responsibility
if there are things to be discussed, you should have informed me
never had he been so happy as at that moment
i’m speaking in general
he had even been given a nod of approval
they exchanged a few remarks about its new director, and when consul hagenström declared him to be an absolutely honest fellow for the second time, the senator fell silent
i turn about, thrust the bench aside with my knee, and stride back across the carpet, through this hell-hole of lusts, past the vaunting bawdstrot, through the entry, and down the stairs into the street, never touching the rail of brass
it was an explosion, an eruption of honest despair, and it burst from her like some elemental force that brooked no opposition, for which there was no rebuttal
certainly he had seen me board, but he avoided my glance
after everything i previously indicated, indeed explicitly stated about inez's emotional life, i shall leave it to the reader to imagine the tangled resentments, the embarrassment and shame she felt when observing such dalliances
these words, which leverkiihn has his testa, his witness and narrator, proclaim in a ghostly melody moving in steps of pure fourths and diminished fifths and resting atop stationary unrelated harmonies, words that then form the text of the daringly archaic responsory repeated in unforgettable fashion by two four-part choirs moving against one another-these words do not belong to the apocalypse of john at all; they come from a different layer, from the prophecy of babylonian exile, the stories and lamentations of ezekiel, to which, moreover, that mysterious epistle from patmos, written in the days of nero, stands in very curiously dependent relation
he sat huddled in his caped coat, smoking cigarettes and joining in the conversation only to comment on this particular topic
and that is mutual, i hope?
what an absurd want of fashion!
no doubt of it, johann buddenbrook was also nearing his end
in meadows wide alone i stand, he managed, and then it was most definitely over
the buddenbrooks were certainly not the only guests
he rolled his eyes and his head fell back hard on the wood
naturally, the first person to offer his congratulations on the morning of july  was herr wenzel
hans castorp was silent
settembrini, of course, had no objections to any of it; but ferge as his second and hans castorp as the neutral party were beside themselves, and the latter even turned abusive with wretched wehsal
and with a laugh that betrayed his confusion and excitement at having arrived and seeing his cousin again, hans castorp lifted out his valise and winter coat, his plaid blanket roll plus cane and umbrella, and finally ocean steamships
over the years, old herr marcus’s meticulous, fussy habits had gone beyond eccentricity—they were a mania
don’t laugh—that’s not a joke
do you think she’ll be happy with him?
and as he was pulled back into the then and there, time and space were abrogated—so intensely, so totally, that one might have thought a lifeless body lay there on the bench beside the torrent, while the real hans castorp was moving about in an earlier time, in different surroundings, confronted by a situation that, for all its simplicity, he found both fraught with risk and filled with intoxication
it is beyond dispute, and i thank a friendship that brought me great sorrow and dismay, but always filled me with pride, for the insight: genius is a form of the life force that is deeply versed in illness, that both draws creatively from it and creates through it
the consul, however, was cold, was constantly freezing although his head was hot; and he stopped to consider that if the head nurse had offered him a thermometer, he would have refused it, and yet it would not have been the right thing to do somehow, since it would be impolite to use someone else’s, his nephew’s for example
how could they justify leaving people in such uncertainty?

it doesn’t do that for our conscious minds, we simply assume it does, just for the sake of convenience
she is furious, outraged to the depths of her soul; her voice is all betrayal and injured love—or she makes it sound that way
we measure on a grand scale—it is one of the privileges of shades
i’m very sorry, he would reply, oh, worthy friend, uomo non educato dal dolore riman sempre bambino!
hanno’s upper body slowly straightened up, his eyes grew large, his tightly closed lips quivered, he jerked back, drawing air in through his nose—and then that blessedness could be held back no longer
instead, obstinately baring her rabbit’s teeth, she attempted by way of allusion and innuendo to get to the bottom of the relationship of these three young people, only one part of which was clear to her: that poor karen, as she remarked, could not help enjoying the high life chaperoned by two such smart young cavaliers
where work and sincerity no longer agree, how is one to work?
it was much more difficult, however, to maintain command of himself when he sat quietly, doing nothing
there is a form of depression in which everything that would normally annoy us and arouse a healthy response of anger, weighs down upon us instead, eliciting only dull, gloomy silence
severe migraine attacks kept him in darkness; he was beset with alternating catarrhs of the stomach, bronchi, and throat throughout the winter of , and they alone would have sufficed to prevent him from traveling to frankfurt-just as they caused his doctor categorically to forbid a far more urgent journey, one that was indisputably and palpably necessary in human terms
but that idea suited me better than him
there was a fluttery, drolly confused quality to her mind that could evoke even her own heartiest laughter-not at all the laugh of a leo zink ingratiating himself by self-mockery, but rather that of a quite pure heart disposed to mirth
the man who offered them to her was a young alsatian industrialist whom business brought to pforzheim from strasbourg on occasion and who, upon making her acquaintance within a large circle of friends, had fallen desperately in love with this mocking, shapely blond
his heart was inert, seemed not to be beating at all
because they are now headed back down into the dark, maybe?
they promptly agreed, and they took their leave of frau permaneder for the present, saying that they hoped to have the pleasure of seeing her again before they departed
ladies and gentlemen—excruciating, heart-wrenching
once the ladies and gentlemen have made themselves comfortable in the sitting room and the salon, it will not be long before all these splendid things will be passed around, and one hopes there will be enough, since the whole family has gathered, though not the extended family, because through the oeverdiecks there is a distant relationship to the kistenmakers, and through them to the möllendorpfs and so on
he was the other person to whom lukaček, the ladies’ tailor, had sublet rooms

it would surely have been childish to think that the engineering sciences and the laws of mechanics had been applied to organic nature, any more than one could say that they had been derived from it
it was not his normal bedtime, he told himself, and then, of course, he had napped too often during the day
he did not, we repeat, let it alter his honestly deferential, if at times slightly brash sympathy for a man of stature—simply because that man shared traveling expenses with a lady from whom hans castorp had borrowed a pencil on mardi gras evening
snow, joachim’s voice said from behind the glass partition
little fräulein weichbrodt had clever and piercing brown eyes, a gently arching nose, and thin lips that she could press together with great determination
rudiger had introduced the schlaginhaufens to adrian as well, who, as a monosyllabic stranger, now had superficial, uneventful encounters with eminent painters already elevated to the nobility, with the wagnerian heroine tanya orlanda, likewise with felix mottl, with ladies of the bavarian court, with schiller's great-grandson, herr von gleichen-russwurm, who wrote books on cultural history, and with writers who wrote nothing at all, but spent themselves entertaining society with literary small talk
true, it has grown quite dark
that is … no, i don’t really know, my child
they all laughed, and before the humanist could fly off the handle, hans castorp quickly told about a thrashing he had once received—a punishment still administered sometimes in the lower grades of his high school, where there had been riding crops in every room; and although social disparities had prevented teachers from laying a hand on him, he had once been thrashed by a bigger classmate, a lout of a fellow, who had applied the supple switch to his thighs and calves, right through his thin stockings, and it had hurt something awful, he would never forget, it had been beastly, almost mystical, and to his shame he had heaved great sobs and hot tears of rage and agony had flowed—and here hans castorp begged herr wehsal’s pardon for using the obscure word wehsal for agony
his name was wiedemann, a christian name—nothing unclean about his name
i am thoroughly convinced that it has something to do with this damned flushed face of mine—it’s been bothering me again ever since i got up
but let me tell you right off: a case like yours is not healed just like that
it is rather contrariwise
she loved to receive visitors in the brown silk salon and decided to make no exception in her father’s case, for although the exact nature of the current situation was unclear to her, she had a keen and solemn sense of its importance
she also chatted long hours away recalling their days together at boarding school, their bedtime conversations, armgard von schilling in mecklenburg, and eva ewers in munich
i was merely quoting a passage from the masterpiece of your national literature
respectable civilian, i could tell right off
i assume what we have here is a mixture of animal and vegetable material—good stuff, indeed, the best, since it must pack one thundering wallop
the feeling is not mutual, she said, her eyes still fixed on herr grünlich’s chest; and, having shot her poisoned dart, she left him standing there, simply walked on, her head set back and flushed with pride at her sarcastic rhetorical powers; but upon returning home, she learned that herr grünlich had been invited to share a veal roast the next sunday
the time still given him to read, to quote, to drink red wine and idle about-we did not sell him that, it is naught but time made congenial
he’s the son of my mother’s half—
a little exercise would do me a great deal of good
after that, i didn’t really do much of anything, just lay low
and if the stimulus is very strong, the hair follicles become erect, too—and your hair stands on end, on your head and all over your body, like a porcupine defending itself
all such therapies, however, are a matter of blind chance, employed more or less just in case they might have some effect, but with no certainty that there is any value, point, or purpose in them
instead of being intellectually enriched and morally strengthened by his experience, may he not perhaps find that his knowledge of the disease becomes clouded and confused?
you know all,   he repeated, letting go of her hand and pushing his chair back a little
crazy kid he was, crazy fellow
he had never taken certain of his cousin’s resolves all that seriously—at least not as long as they remained pronouncements
witness or neutral party, in any case he would have a chance to influence decisions about the modalities, which proved sorely necessary
i never found it all that natural, even if i’m not a homo humanus
culture had been free, had stood at an admirable pinnacle, and if it had long since grown accustomed to being totally irrelevant to the state, its younger repres-entatives wished to regard the great national war that had now broken out as the means for breaking through to a new form of life in which state and culture would be one
and finally, you’ll need to have more money sent, too
leave that to me, peeperkorn replied, and the rest is merely a matter of practice and habit
she can sit however she likes, she’ll always be tony buddenbrook
best wishes for a continued pleasant stay
well, yes—proselytizer, fisher of souls
armgard’s noble status made the granddaughter of the stylish lebrecht kröger flush with admiration; but secretly she sometimes thought that that splendid syllable von would actually suit her far better—because, good heavens, armgard hadn’t the vaguest how lucky she was
it was the third day after a quartan attack; mynheer let it be known he wished to take advantage of the fact
what else should i tell you?
in brief, bethsy, i can only sincerely wish that this marriage take place, to the benefit of both our family and the firm
he wanted to move on, but farther than just an hour's train ride in the direction of the mountains
that was a long time ago
and pretty things they are!
he graduated with honors and, true to his resolve, exchanged the life of a boarding-school pupil for that of a novice in nearby tisis—a life of service and humility, of silent subordination and religious training, from which he wrested intellectual pleasures congruent with his earlier wild fantasies
but among the solid, honest, and respectable citizens were many who shook their heads and said, peculiar, the way she dresses, and her hair, her posture, that face
what a sad figure you cut, let me assure you
the gentlemen smoked their cigars as they strode down the wide staircase with its openwork railing of white-enameled wood
everything ended in dictatorship, in violence, in any case; for with the demolition of traditional forms of government and society by the french revolution, an age had dawned that-consciously or not, admittedly or not-was moving toward despotic tyranny over atomized, disconnected masses leveled to a common denominator and as powerless as the individual
one day he said, jean—enough, don’t you think?
her breasts, which were not voluptuous and highset like marusya’s, but the small breasts of a young girl, were pressed together from both sides
and continuing the treatments, adrian returned on the next three days as well; then dr erasmi ordered a three-day pause and asked him to return on day four
but the next day, of course, he had been more dead than alive
i woul_d certainly not get caught up in detailed reminiscences of this bucolic childhood world, this simple setting of field and wood, pond and hill, if it were not the very world-parental home and native landscape-that enfolded adrian's early years (until he turned ten) and brought the two of us together so often
he found a long list of lieder, too, sung to piano accompaniment by artists from the great opera houses—both those composed out of conscious, sublime, personal art, and simple folk songs, plus those that fell somewhere in the middle, as it were, which were products of the intellect and yet written with a genuinely profound, devout understanding of a given national spirit—artistic folk songs, if one may put it that way, with no implication of compromised sincerity in the word artistic
but why feed his remorse-if remorse it was that spoke in his words, in his demeanor?
i bowed to inez institoris
and in general, those parts of this book dealing with music theory are indebted in many details to schoenberg's theory of harmony
they discussed the communal gift that, following an old institutional custom, would be presented to director behrens on christmas eve and for which a collection was being started
not-or not only-because upon his return from the tour of switzerland, adrian had told me, together with other things, about his meeting with marie and had given me a description of her person that included, as a casual observation, the resemblance of her voice to his mother's-along with
naphta, he continued, was certainly just as much a revolutionary as herr settembrini, but in a defensive, reactionary sense—he was a revolutionary of reaction
and is herr mantelsack the man to inspire fear like that?
she reached her hand out to him and laid her head on her shoulder
in short, we all, without exception, did some intensive work there
tony caught his look as she got up, but she wasn’t embarrassed in the least
the sun was gone, and there was an almost inhospitable chill in the air
i shall mum it all down on this music paper here, while my fellow in eremo, with whom i laugh, drudges some distance off in our chamber, translating the alien he dotes upon into the homely he detests
to be honest, we are not really bothered about leaving the question open
it had taken one whole hour to cross a little meadow
he began to say his good-byes
whereas kafka claimed that salzmann demanded his patients drink the vine’s gladdening gift in such quantities—likewise with a view to rounding off their bills—that people were dying like flies, and not of phthisis, but of cirrhosis
across his knees was an object, the souvenir that had frightened his uncle the day he had picked it up off his nephew’s chest of drawers: the glass negative that revealed the portrait of clavdia chauchat’s interior and that he, hans castorp, had most definitely not brought into the room
but i knew or feared that his  till tomorrow would not hold, but that after my departure he would set to work again and finish what had come over him all unbidden during our conversation-and follow it up with two luminol tablets that would have to give his slumber some depth to compensate for its brevity, only to begin anew at dawn
but do l-as a man who can speak of an early, significant infatuation of head and heart with adrian's cool and enigmatically self-contained existence-do i have the least right to mock the fascination that his solitary, nonconforming way of life had on these women?
what people called thomas buddenbrook’s vanity—the attention he devoted to how he looked, the luxurious fastidiousness with which he dressed—was in reality something fundamentally different
you see, i’ve never met a perfectly healthy person before
madame kethelsen wept silent, bitter tears, although she could hear almost nothing
and, good heavens, was it not love as well-or what was it, what obsession, what act of will recklessly tempting god, what impulse to incorporate the punishment in the sin, or finally, what most deeply secreted desire to receive and conceive the demonic, to unleash a deadly chemical change within his own body was it-that caused him, though warned, to spurn the warning and insist on possessing that flesh ?
the day before yesterday, the niederpaurs had a dinner party, which was absolutely lovely, although i couldn’t always follow the conversation and i found the tone rather équivoque at times
he had, by the way, only imagined that his fever came from his cold—the objective findings were as usual
settembrini replied, i shoot in whatever direction i choose
he attended artists' balls with schildknapp, and there in the illusory twilight of a stylishly decorated hall, he would again encounter the members of the rodde circle-the young actors, the knoterichs, dr kranich, zink and spengler, the daughters of the house themselves; he might be sitting at a table with clarissa and inez, along with rudiger, spengler, and kranich, perhaps even with jeannette scheurl, when schwerdtfeger-dressed as a peasant lad or in the costume of a fifteenth-century florentine that showed off his pretty legs and lent him more than a little resemblance to botticelli's portrait of a young man in a red cap-would approach and, caught up in the gala mood, totally forgetting for the moment any need to elevate his mind, and just to be nice, would fetch the rodde girls to dance
but hurry now, otherwise you won’t get a hot meal
seated at the good russian table was a quite elegant provincial lady from minsk, still young and only slightly ill—she had been sentenced to three months, no more—who one day went down into town to shop for french blouses
but this delicate, quiet symmetry did anything but calm him—it annoyed and offended him
he suffered from occasional hemorrhaging of the lungs and always spoke in an ironic tone of voice, because he considered himself as clever as he was sickly
but i feel sorriest for tony
because things were not quite as proper as they should have been four years ago?
he gave me his hand first, he declared when he looked up and saw me
but that is why the ear's judgment of what is right and false is directly and irrefutably tied to it, to this one chord that is not false in itself, quite apart from any abstract reference to the general technical niveau
and what was probably a weakly illumined cloud clung to a cliff, motionless, like an elongated tatter of smoke
ah, that was like the proverbial patient who keeps shifting in bed, hoping each new position will bring relief
well, you see, hans castorp said
and yet he felt some sympathy for the melancholy fate of his clairvoyant great-aunt
and what in the world does that have to do with politics or the lack thereof?
it’s sniffles, director behrens, hans castorp replied
i had not expected him to meet me at the train station, had not even notified him of my exact time of arrival
but now you are advocating an economic system whose morality deprives the individual of freedom and dignity
i don’t think you have any justification for that remark
he repeated it with a snort, bent forward, began to shake, to gasp for air, and could no longer contain himself
but adrian's illness was one of those serious cases that tended to immobilize rudiger's charm-indeed we know that any sense of his being urgently needed resulted in his being perversely sparing of himself

youth in search of light would never be won over by that kind of fanaticism

then he drew a long breath, raised his arms shoulder-high, and let them drop to his sides again
he would intentionally bring unfinished work to kretzschmar in order to be told what he already knew on his ownin order then to make fun of the artistic sense of his teacher, which corresponded, in fact, to his own: the artistic sense (with the emphasis on the second word) that is the real agent of the work-idea (not the idea of a work, but the idea that is the opus itself, the objective and harmonic structure at rest within itself), the true manager of its unity and organic wholeness, plastering over cracks, plugging holes, establishing the
you see, when it comes to death, when one speaks to the dead or about them, latin comes into its own
he would hear his cousin get up from his lounge chair and walk back into the room with dr krokowski, presumably to show him his fever chart; and then the conversation might continue a while longer, to judge from the delay before the assistant appeared at joachim’s door by way of the hall
for although i was two years older
she was never as stunning as you, but there was a time—i was already a young girl—when she was a truly beautiful woman
and yet, for all that, the accomplishments of protoplasm remained quite inexplicable—it seemed that life was prohibited from understanding itself
and then, as a matter of course, christian began to disregard the constraint of office hours, to appear later and later each morning, puffing on his after-breakfast cigarette, before finally starting his preparations for work; he would then go to the club for his midday meal and not return until rather late, sometimes not before evening, sometimes not at all
they are satisfied with her lung
nothing is truer than that in the fugue beethoven never achieved the technical assurance, skill, or ease that mozart commanded

the consul experienced life here, gathered impressions—and we do not wish to spy on him any further
luise ziemssen was a brave woman
and suddenly the trembling, hasty, furtive voice of benthien the clothier floated out over the assembly: gentlemen, gentlemen

life, young man, is a woman, a woman sprawled before us, with close-pressed bulging breasts and a great, soft belly between those broad hips, with slender arms and swelling thighs, with eyes half-closed in mocking defiance, demanding our most urgent response, the proof or collapse of our resilient manly desire—collapse, young man, do you understand what that means?
far more characteristic of this psychological situation, however, so schleppfuss suggested, was the restraint imposed upon another young man of that same era, for it had come upon him through no fault of his own, but through female sorcery, and the means by which he had rid himself of it proved quite tragic
can it be your manchester eyes have failed to notice the existence of a social theory that promises the victory of man over economics, a social theory whose principles and goals coincide exactly with those of the christian city of god?
to be frank, tom, it’s my most fervent wish
you spoke of a course of practical activity on which you intended to embark shortly
it is going to live … and thinking that it and i are separate instead of one and the same—that is the illusion that death will set right
i was glad to be on hand to provide adrian protection
but of course, to be sure, his uncle hastened to reply, losing control of his lower jaw; he now explained that he could stay only eight days, or rather, just a week, seven days actually, perhaps even only six
if one of fräulein weichbrodt’s charges played a joke on someone, she would laugh aloud in her amiable way, so heartily that it almost sounded like a wail, until sesame would rap insistently on the table and cry, nelly!—though it sounded more like nally!—intimidating her into silence
because he loved everything about the theater: the smell of gas lamps, the seats, the musicians, even the curtain
he enjoyed-and could spend hours-making clear to his pupil the influence the french had had on the russians, the italians on the germans, the germans on the french
we shall ask dr ting-fu from our table
but at the same time his eyes, seeking out the distance, registered a special look, and the dusk of their metallic flecks would retreat deeper into shadow
both wine and coffee, hans castorp heard him say, were good for fever—quite apart from their regaling effect, they were very good for his intermittent attacks of tropical fever, one of which kept him bedfast in his room for several hours the second day after his arrival
the chaldeans already knew about it, too—the chaldeans, if you please, that ancient tribe of semitic or arabic magicians, highly trained astrologists and diviners
hermetic’—i’ve always liked that word

it is not just that you are weak-willed—you never fail to excuse your weakness and justify it
whether due to his general bent for paradox or out of courtesy, he called hegel a catholic thinker; and in response to the priest’s smiling question about the basis for this comment, inasmuch as hegel was actually the state philosopher of prussia and generally considered a protestant, leo had replied: the very term state philosopher confirmed he was correct in pointing to hegel’s catholicity in the religious sense, if not, of course, in regard to church dogmatics
sometimes it was the bark of roots that had such qualities, like those of a vine on the malay peninsula called strychnos tieuté, with which the natives mixed snake venom to make upas-rajah, a drug that when introduced into the bloodstream, with a dart or arrow for instance, led to almost instant death, although there was no one who could have told young hans castorp how it actually did so
but given the singular statements that memory has just now dictated me to write, statements of what i might call a specific intensity, there can surely be no doubt about the fact to be communicated here

mynheer peeperkorn, an elderly dutchman, had for some time been a guest of the sanatorium berghof, which quite rightly appended the adjective international to its name
and mingling among them, the middle-class folk: shopkeepers from nearby, who have stepped out without a hat to exchange views; young, well-dressed merchants; sons, who are serving three- or four-year apprenticeships in offices run by their fathers or their fathers’ friends; schoolboys with bookbags and backpacks
suddenly she saw what looked like silk curtains parting, like the ones in her grandparents’ salon
a new beginning, after that farewell?

many thanks, deutschlin, adrian said, laughing
adrian most certainly did fling himself into those immeasurable realms that astrophysical science attempts to measure-only to arrive at measurements, numbers, orders of magnitude to which the human mind can no longer relate at all and that lose themselves in theory and abstraction, in the domain of the non-sensory, if not to say, nonsensical
your mama and i want to talk, you see
when you stop and consider, it is, after all, the true, genuine humanist form of art
yet these pious works were, at the same time, an end in themselves, and the satisfaction he found in feeding porridge to sickly frau mallinckrodt, in letting herr ferge describe his infernal pleural shock, or in seeing poor karen clap her hands with joy and gratitude, despite the bandaged fingertips, was not only of a vicarious and relative kind, but also genuine and immediate
then he turned around and left

the servants are dividing things up right under my nose, because severin has the keys to all the cupboards

the center of town was lively and crowded—it was saturday, market day
he did not wish to offend either side, he said, but apparently the subject had now turned to progress, to human progress, and so in a certain sense to politics, the republic of eloquence, the civilization of the educated west; and in that regard he would like to say that the difference, or if herr naphta preferred, the opposition between life and religion could be traced to that between time and eternity
but do you not think, herr buddenbrook, that your son-in-law’s bankruptcy might not mistakenly tend to put your own situation in a bad light?

it was kind of a biweekly thousand and one nights spun out at random, and, like scheherazade’s stories for a curious prince, each lecture was calculated to please its audience and prevent acts of violence
and then, after something was said about the current price of rye—fifty-five thalers and still falling, damn it—and perhaps a comment made about some event in the life of one of the town’s families, herr wenzel vanished down the ground-floor hall to empty his shiny shaving bowl out on the cobblestones, and the consul climbed back up the spiral stairs to his bedroom, where gerda was awake now
what were my very words to both you and him—not ten but a hundred times?

he stood there bent down over the table, but with his head held to one side so that everyone could see that he had his eyes closed, and drew blindly with a pencil on the back side of a calling card; and without any help from his eyes, his massive hand traced an outline, the profile of a pig—more simplified and slightly idealized than realistic, but it was undoubtedly a rudimentary pig that he managed to assemble under such handicapped circumstances
rotten, rotten, she said
his father was a literary type himself, you know, and i believe the grandfather was, too
he spent nearly his whole day with her, engaging her in religious and secular conversation or reading aloud to her in his high, cracking voice that bumped along in the droll accents of his baltic homeland
conditions here were most beneficial for encouraging him, because people lived together in a restricted area and followed a rigid schedule mandatory for all
they hung up their coats and for the second time today they entered the dining hall, where the meal was in full swing
perhaps it can merely avoid doing damage by speaking along ritardando
i have those in my head, thomas said, leaning back, staring across to the landscape room and letting his yellow pencil sweep back and forth over the tabletop—and now he began to explain how matters stood
would you like to hear about it?
this is no apparatus, no machine, he went on, extracting a needle from one of the colorful tin boxes set out on the table and screwing it into place, this is an instrument, this is a stradivarius, a guarneri—you’ll hear resonances and vibrations of vintage raffinemang
the reader will sense the irony intended, though truly without any malice, by my evidently, since there was in fact no evidence for such a conclusion-unless, that is, it had been present from the very beginning and the relationship between the two had undergone no development whatever since helmut first approached the senator's daughter
it was clear that dr mantelsack was calling on people in no regular order whatever and did not care at all who had not been examined for some time
he just waved me aside
even massenet is bewitching, lui aussi
h (which anglo-saxons call a b) and ends on an es (known in the english-speaking world as e-flat), with e and a alternating in between-a basic motif with an oddly melancholy sound that pervades his music in a variety of harmonic and rhythmic disguises, assigned now to one voice, now to another, often in its inverted form, as if turned on its axis, with the intervals still the same, but with the notes in reverse sequence
fine—and with that you have opened the door wide for every sort of crime
pale and trembling, he closed his eyes and sank into lethargy
he wore a dignified black pleated coat and pea-colored trousers, much like those he had worn for his first visit to meng strasse
that’s no reproach, tony, the consul said sternly
he asked with a laugh that was half annoyance
but, despite countless personal visits, she kept on writing frequent letters to him in pfeiffering in this same fashion
you know what you’re eating there
he evidently gave the matter no thought, but regarded this precious link in an invisible chain, which he placed on his finger when composing, as nothing more than the connection between his solitude and the world-which for him seemed faceless, with scarcely any personal definition, and concerning whose individual traits he apparently had far fewer questions than i was there, i asked myself, something in the external appearance of this woman that would explain the basic principle of her relationship with adrian: the invisibility, the avoidance, the refusal to meet?
who was it that left just recently?
can anyone understand what that means?
herr settembrini had the honor of being a member
he trembled as he read and was profoundly stirred by the rigid, but impressive antitheses so evident from the pages of these documents: impeccable deportment on the one side and rascally, disreputable laxness on the other
it seems to me that the spiritual possibility of finding salvation in repose is widespread throughout all mankind
movement is the only thing that can help
just as he was leaving and crossing the corridor, he met his father and a gentleman in a long black coat coming up the stairs
oh, dear god, i’ll pray every day
he’s saying to himself, anyone!
and with that, the reluctant debtor had been outfoxed and at least that particular matter was settled
yes, he is, papa, he’s sitting in the pensée room, looking at our album
you’ve won yourself a place in life, a position of honor, and now you stand here, so cold and self-assured, and reject anything that might confuse you for even a moment and throw you off balance
it’s so strange—sometimes i’m certain it is going to go into spasms or some sort of paralysis, permanent paralysis
no, kesselmeyer, i implore you, just calm down and listen to me
adrian confessed that he always found something intelligently calming about baptist spengler and enjoyed talking with him-but he was much less susceptible to the confiding familiarity of another guest who attempted to break through his brittle shyness
i always envy you when i see you sitting there and working, and it really isn’t work for you
i was won over to her not only by the gentle night of her gaze (to which i knew just how susceptible adrian was), by her charming smile, her musical voice, but also by her friendly and intelligent reserve, by the businesslike assurance, indeed standoffishness of an independent professional woman who disdained any sort of cooing femininity
interruptions—yes, the consul repeated with an obliging smile
the consul had been dead for two weeks now—it was half past five in the afternoon of the day on which the will was to be read
the various branches of this once rich, powerful, and proud family had withered, died, and rotted away, and little kai had only one aunt who was still alive—and his father was not on speaking terms with her
it’s quite irresponsible of him
my fondest greetings to papa, christian, clara, thilda, and ida jungmann
disdaining the bombast of numbers, he had originally intended to instrument the score for the classical orchestra of beethoven, and it was only for the sake of armado, the comically pompous spaniard, that he had included a second pair of horns, three trombones, and a bass tuba in his orchestra
frau stöhr in particular became wildly talkative, and her willful face, its cheeks lined with tiny wrinkles, turned scarlet above her ruffled collar
you’re a scandal to the whole town, and if this house were mine i would turn you out, i would show you the door!
isn’t everything going just fine?
of course there are exceptions, fräulein tony, he said heatedly
i have learned how to bear the truth, believe me
even though they are dead, jonathan said, and tears came to his eyes-�hereas adrian, as i could well see, was shaking with suppressed laughter
the spirit demanded that he take on not just the role of poet and prophet, but of composer as well
and what else might be recorded here after her own name, given to her in honor of her grandmother antoinette?
it’s all kept secret from me
madame grünlich did not miss the chance of telling this story at the dinner table that evening for all to hear, so that even elisabeth broke into her spluttering kröger laugh
the director had predicted it all, and it all happened as per regulation, with no deviations from the norm worth mentioning
frau permaneder loved these visits
the long, pointed tips of his mustache still extended beyond his cheeks, and they were fuller now—but pale and sallow, without blood or life
composing means commissioning the zapfensti:isser orchestra to perform an angelic chorus
i only have to keep an eye on my ward’s dowry, the rest is no concern of mine
only yesterday he had been totally caught up in his normal train of thought, preoccupied with what had just occurred, his exams, and with what was about to occur, his joining the firm of tunder and wilms (dockyards, machine works, and boilers), and looking well beyond these next three weeks with as much impatience as his nature allowed
it is hard to say how such people actually first come to betray themselves; they cannot, it seems, do or refrain from doing anything that does not betray them—particularly (as a certain gentleman who had no trouble forming opinions remarked) in the company of people who have only two things in their heads: the first being their temperature, the second their temperature
there is no determining precisely when it was written, for the document bears no date
she led dr langhals into the next room, crossed her arms, and laid her head back, trying at the same time to press her chin against her chest
you and your loved ones can rent a pretty little house or an apartment somewhere outside the town gates, for instance
herr grünlich had pulled an armchair over near her window seat; he sat down now, forcing her to take her seat again as well; bending forward, he took her hand, limp with helplessness, in his own and continued in an impassioned voice, fräulein antonie, since that first moment, that first afternoon—you recall that afternoon, do you not?—when there in the circle of your family i first saw you, an elegant, unimaginable vision of loveliness, your name has been written—he corrected himself—engraved on my heart in indelible letters
i’ve become quite convinced of it
nor do i batter her ears all that much with it, since at present i pursue harmony and the punctum contra punctum principally in theory, with books, pen, and paper and at my own devices, which is to say: under the oversight and discipline of amicus kretzschmar, to whom every few days i bear my exercises and works for censure or approval
but the headrest was adjustable, and behrens tried it for comfort, stretching out on it with his useless plate still under one arm; pretending to be fafnir guarding his treasure, he began to snore like a sawmill
no one listened to him
midsummer night celebrations, with fires and dances around the leaping flames, everyone joining hands
at which point several more letters were exchanged concerning his plans, and in the summer of  christian buddenbrook did indeed sail for valparaiso, where he had found a position
what does that matter?
as a kind of identification, like a passport or membership card
and then all of a sudden they demanded that hans castorp immediately make an appointment to be examined
i’ve lost all hope
symptoms both in themselves and in those who compose back to the past
he conducted himself sensibly, cheerfully, even-temperedly; whereas christian seemed moody, capable on the one hand of the silliest comedy and on the other of behavior so odd that it would terrify his entire family
really a bit too peculiar
attendant fatigue and a propensity to nausea (accompanied by headache), is the reason for my reticence and worry-it will, it should induce me to abstain
the apocalypse abandons orchestral interludes, with the result that at more than one point the chorus takes on an amazingly explicit orchestral characteras in the choral variations that represent the hymn of the , redeemed who fill the heavens, where the nature of the chorale is preserved simply by having all four voices moving constantly to the same rhythm, while the orchestra accompanies or opposes them in the most richly contrasted rhythms
herr von maiboom needs money, he needs a great deal of money very soon
would it seem so absurd to you if you were to crown the honor you do me-l am tempted to say, for my salvation-through services of which posterity will perhaps know nothing, or again, perhaps it will, by acting as my mediator, as the interpreter between me and life, as my intercessor with fortune?
a horrible incident at a meal one day, however, did make an impression on the young man
and none of the good citizens sitting near him on the heavy, carved wooden benches, drinking their pints, understood what the advent of a gerda arnoldsen meant in the modest life of gosch the broker, who longed for extraordinary events
no shouldering the wheel, no budging the cart, he wrote a few weeks later from the capital of bavaria, in a parody of kumpfian style that was his way of announcing that he had begun composition of love 's labour's lost and of prodding me to bring the rest of the adaptation to a quick conclusion
let us assume, for example, that the symptoms of the incubation stage—moodiness, fatigue, lack of appetite, restless sleep, headaches—are usually present even when the patient, on whom his family pins all its hopes, is moving about in good health
returning home from wendell kretzschmar's lecture, we had the feeling that we had heard the missa, and that illusion was not a little influenced by the picture he had impressed on our minds of the haggard and hungry master there in the doorframe
diederich schwarzkopf did not offer to shake hands; he simply let his heavy frame jerk forward briefly, as if to say: that’s how it’s done
i am enchanted by the idyllic world with which you have been wise enough to surround yourself, maitre
i hope they will let me speak with her there
yes, we might note that there was much to discuss and share: about matter as a disreputable degeneration of the immaterial, about life as an impudency of matter, about illness as life’s lascivious form
and still intent on punishing him, fräulein engelhart claimed she was sure they were
oh, how hard and sad it all is
unfortunately, there is normally some sort of moral judgment involved in identifying traits of character, whether for the purpose of praise or censure, even though every such trait has its two sides
and besides, there’s something so cold, so disillusioning about a ring—it is a symbol of a woman’s dependence, it seems to me; it makes a woman seem practically a nun, turns her into a wallflower, a touch-me-not
yes, jean, the first to leave us
my head is full of all kinds of ideas about time—a whole complex of thoughts, let me tell you
they were later permitted to admit their error in making this gloomy prophecy; but no one could deny that hanno was somewhat backward in his development

to which the consul, still drumming with this newspaper, replied, just eat
her resourcefulness in searching out hidden objects was greeted with much applause and admiring laughter, and that might have been the end of it; but when she began guessing her complicated task, people slowly fell silent
up in his living room, there where i had heard inez's agonized confessions, i told him, after first preparing him with a few words, what i had witnessed
which is to say, that adrian returned to that place on account of one particular person, the one whose touch still burned on his cheek, the nut-brown lass in the jacket and with the large mouth, who had approached him at the piano and whom he called esmeralda
hans castorp felt sincerely sorry for his cousin—you could read in his eyes his sadness at the impending loss of a human companion—but he pitied him most when he thought about how the poor fellow would have to stay on here without him, whereas he would be living down in the flatlands, hard at work in the service of transportation technology, which brought nations closer together
and let me tell you it’s quite an event for me
gentlemen, he said, one word more—my brother christian’s nerves are not good, he doesn’t handle these things well
should we jews-since we are a priestly people, even if we do mince about in parisian salons-not feel ourselves drawn to germanness and not allow that to dispose us to irony over against the
you know best yourself about all the things consul hagenström has done to try to eclipse you in business, to do you harm—it’s not for me to tell you about that
a game of carom, senator?
thomas was back on meng strasse by the end of july, but, like other gentlemen whose business kept them in town, he visited his family at the shore several times
if only we had a bit of frost, a bit of snow
he no longer stares down the illness with a hostile eye; he is a biased and hardly unequivocal foe
petersen called out in a fit of gallows humor
the effect was so overwhelming that hans castorp closed his eyes and whispered to himself, my god!
and what was it like for me?
people smoked with gusto and in scattered groups discussed how the session was going
gesturing hospitably with his little right hand, he was trying to lead them to the silk-upholstered chairs, but hans castorp, as if spellbound, headed straight for the wooden sculpture and stopped in front of it, his hands on his hips and his head tilted to one side
more precisely, hans castorp had recognized her
oh, it was genuine, quite in character—that was the one good thing about it
is there a bank out there in the world somewhere, perhaps, that will put one thin dime on the table for you?
except, there is the other side
hans castorp had his answer at the ready
i can only be grateful, you know, that my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather paved the way for me, and that a great deal of the trust and esteem they gained in this town have automatically fallen to me
her sex knows no pity or concern when staring at the horrors of passion, an elemental emotion with which the female is apparently much more familiar than the male, who is not at all at ease with it—and if she finds him in that state, she never fails to greet him with mockery and schadenfreude
i can’t say i’ve got him figured out after only today, but if we get together with him often enough, maybe we’ll both be able to
and so hans castorp decided to be on the alert and not to step aside if ellen brand should have further adventures
it has little to do with boldly scrambling about in the mountains, as opposed to lying calmly beside the sea
but here—well, i doubt if they’ll be interested up here
soon, then, there developed an intolerance of light and sound-more disquieting than his previous moodiness
therese weichbrodt was a well-read—indeed, almost learned—spinster, whose life was a series of small, earnest battles to maintain the faith of her childhood, her optimistic piety, and the conviction that she would one day be recompensed in the great beyond for her hard and lackluster life
of what i said to him about the significance of the day, the point of my coming, he obviously understood nothing
a man joined the ranks of berghof society, a thirty-year-old former businessman, who had wandered from sanatorium to sanatorium for years now with his fever

not with water, of course—it’s a wax doll
let me see, please, he said curtly
you draw your salary and never come to the office—although that’s not what exasperates me
and extending one long arm, he handed his stethoscope to dr krokowski, who stood up and grabbed it, so that he could perform his own little assistant’s post-examination on joachim

or they rowed across the trave to priwall, where they looked for amber
she was really very pretty, little tony buddenbrook was

and in a case where an impenitent soul had violated the law, temporary merciless procedures were no less justifiable
the others, however, said not a word
as a friend, do you want me to spend the rest of my life in this hermit's cell?
yes, indeed, once the idea had occurred to him, it had ripened quickly to a wish that he hoped he might be able to realize for himself and his family, provided, of course, that herr gosch did not intend to make all too great a profit from the sale—ha ha
no doubt about it, he had meant something by that
for the beautiful word gave birth to the beautiful deed
it was quiet in the house and out on the street
what a mild bit of teasing was needed to induce ever-alert virtue to don its armor
there were no declined invitations-on the contrary, as i said, there were only additional requests for permission to participate
the focus of the group, she was sitting on the sofa behind the round table at the far end of the small salon, her face turned toward the game room
the large room sank more and more into twilight
twenty-eight sauces for fish
on another occasion they are sitting at supper and the rays of a brilliant sunset fall directly on the good russian table
we are inquiring, rather, about that experience’s moral character—and, to be frank, do not expect a very cheering answer
he turned serious, abruptly, surprisingly, as if a mask had fallen from his face
he saw that the enchantment was broken, that he was released, set free—not by his own actions, as he had to admit to his shame, but set free by elementary external forces, for whom his liberation was a very irrelevant matter
how kind of you, hans castorp said
your beatrice is returning?
but at every possible opportunity he devoted himself energetically to his guest
his systematic eradication of suffering
but the more staid and settled folks should eat well at our table
and aloud he said, very fine, herr settembrini
with which he brought some pleasure to an end
first came an argument between radames and amneris
i will see to it that she does not suffer through no fault of her own
a long walk up here can be lovely, but it has its drawbacks, too, it seems
but in response to my consoling pleas, he simply said, spare yourself, spare yourself and make the sign of the cross!
they hung their coats on the stands outside the dining hall, and entered it, a bright, low-vaulted room, where voices buzzed, dishes clattered, and dining attendants scurried about with steaming pots of coffee
you can’t just walk up to him so calm and cool and
just a moment, thomas
and the place has one shortcoming, you know, it’s not soundproof—that is rather annoying
even when hans castorp left home to study, he regularly sent his things home to be laundered and mended—for it was his maxim that no one in the empire except residents of hamburg knew how to iron—and a badly creased cuff on one of his pretty pastel shirts filled him with a terrible unease
then they looked at one another and smiled, and since there was nothing more to say, they turned away, first shoulders, then backs, and walked off
using the occasion of music
morten spoke out of naïve and goodhearted outrage
analyzed and put into words, his feelings might have been expressed as follows: there was something religious, gripping, and sadly beautiful, which was to say, spiritual about death and at the same time something that was the direct opposite, something very material, physical, which one could not really describe as beautiful, or gripping, or religious, or even as sad
and the unspoken suspicion rose up in him that if she was ill—which she surely was, almost hopelessly ill, since she had been forced to come up here so often and for such long periods—her illness was, if not entirely, then at least in large part, of a moral nature, and was therefore, just as settembrini had said, not the cause or result of her carelessness but in fact identical with it
ah, how can anyone speak of a resemblance at this point?
in all likelihood, i shall never get married, she said with some effort, because of the peppermint powder in her mouth
for after the failure of a certain plot to overthrow the state in turin, in which he had been involved both in word and deed, he very narrowly escaped prince metternich’s hirelings and spent the years of his banishment fighting and bleeding for a constitution in spain and the independence of the hellenic peoples
just where are you young folks headed?
kumpf had accomplished his with good cheer and a healthy trust in god and now re-created it in plain german for us listeners
he pulled himself together, all the same, and quickly peered at hans castorp, who just had time to pull his own eyes away and gaze off vaguely into the air
hans castorp’s humiliating depression had been vanquished by the greetings he had exchanged with clavdia chauchat, and strictly speaking, the real basis of his present satisfaction was his awareness that it had been overcome
i had to laugh and literally winced when in this same connection the gentlemen suddenly turned to dentistry, and quite concretely, to adrian's and my symbol of musical criticism, the dead tooth!
the upper parts of the lungs were brighter now, but the director was still not content
in his youth he was, as he told us in his peripatetic extemporizations, a radiantly enthusiastic student of our classical poetry and philosophy and boasted of having learned by heart all the more important works of schiller and goethe
he only received a letter from him, one that he refused to answer
he placed a scientific embargo on the child, held sessions with her in his analytical dungeon, and hypnotized her, so it was said, in an attempt to develop and train the possibilities slumbering inside her and to probe her previous psychic life
a large clod of din struck his shin—it certainly hurt, but how silly, it was nothing
that dark hair i mentioned half-covered the ears, and as i grew older slowly turned silver; she wore it pulled back so tight that it shimmered and the part in it exposed white skin above her forehead
still in the grip of cold horror, foul scolding whispers still in his ears, he found himself lying in the snow, his head resting on one arm, his legs stretched out before him, his skis still on
one b l a z i n g august
raising her brows, she looked down now through her pince-nez—she had to use it for handiwork now, although she had no idea how to put it squarely in place—and fixed her eyes sternly on her needles, which flew and clattered softly at a bewildering tempo
anticipation, curiosity, joy, and apprehension all merged in my mind to become a profound excitement
there should be an end of privileges and arbitrary power
how i love the stormy surge of yearning that is its essential character, the romanticism of its tone-since, after all, it is handled with the strictest modern methods; a thematic work, to be sure, but with such strong transformations that there are no true
general shrieks—and no one was willing to listen to any more
the nature of the forces they were about to study was such that they simply could not unfold in white light, could not become operative
it was a realm where clinical brightness and cleanliness held sway, everything done in white on white, the doors glistening with white enamel—even the one to dr krokowski’s reception room, to which one of the learned man’s calling cards had been tacked and which lay two steps lower than the hallway itself, so that the room behind the open door looked rather like a suite
you entered my room, it was dusk, and you turned on the light
decisions must be made—decisions of incalculable significance for the future happiness of europe, and your country will have to make them, they must come to fruition within its soul
it is at times hard to differentiate, you see
he had especially favorable words for the impression ursel's fiance, now her husband, had made on him
he bent forward, shaking his head and addressing the empty air with great emphasis
they lived in the via torre argentina, near the teatro constanzi and the pantheon, three flights up, and had a landlady who prepared breakfast and a light supper
it was furnished so simply…
the polish affair of honor was everywhere studied with great passion, and people clenched their teeth when they discussed it
i spotted it at once
settembrini commanded with a scowl
how can he think up so many notes, left and right, all at once?
a monumental work of lamentation like this one is, i say, by necessity an expressive work, a work of expression, and as such is a work of liberation in much the same way as the early music to which it is linked across the centuries sought to express liberation
he was hastening his own demise
but i took adrian's look with me into battle-perhaps it was that look, and only ostensibly typhoid fever carried by lice, that brought me home to his side again so soon
as rollicking as in the prater
then she had got over it, had totally recovered, the doctors said—because she had wanted so much to marry, to live and to marry, and she had succeeded, had been completely cured, was perfectly healthy when she married her dear, robust husband, who had never given a thought to such a thing happening
the consul paced back and forth in the room, sighed, shook his head, gave a shrug
life really is more festive as a twosome, don’t you think, ziemssen, you sly old dog?
it would depend on the universal unity behind all of music's dimensions
but confronted with the statement that atoms were so small they were no longer small, one lost all sense of proportion, because no longer small was tantamount to immense; and that last step to the atom ultimately proved, without exaggeration, to be a fateful one
she returned it meekly, then more meekly still, that is, lowered her eyes more and more, as her head slipped slowly toward her chest and shoulder
or to be more precise, it did not take three days, but only a few minutes of one of them to accomplish this
two weeks ago, i was two on the gaffky, a trifle, the best prospects
and it must be awkward to have people talking about you like this behind your back
a massive dose of musical knowledge-and his own excited participation in it-became part of his life in those days, only to come then for years to what at least appeared to be a total standstill
then she would straighten up and begin to moan; she tossed back and forth, pushed and wrestled with her monitors, whispered hot babble in their ears, made a series of sidelong whiplash movements as if trying to fling something out of her, gnashed her teeth, and once even bit hans castorp’s sleeve
he has spoken rather ungraciously about that part of the press, he continued with a forced ironic smile that, for a moment at least, touched tony to the quick
and upon being summoned so politely and exotically, that lady joined the trio and clasped elly’s fragile wrists in both hands

have we roused civilization’s pedagogic policeman to the point of drawing his sword?
and he began to wait for seven minutes to pass

the cold doesn’t affect you, does it?
hanno looked absolutely miserable, and kai was lost in thought
he thought about what grabow had said—there had been so much that he had left unsaid
but then they let their penitential atonements sing, gave them over to the resonating breath of the human voice, which probably has the most bovine warmth of any sounding board imaginable
and so you wandered around and never found your way home
well, of course, it was well known that the director did oils—what did the teacher want, it wasn’t forbidden, everyone was free to do so
and so, for the first time, the little count entered his friend’s splendid home—and was frank in his admiration, but not the least bit shy
with a flourish, dr mantelsack made a mark fraught with doom next to mumme’s name and scowled as he paged through his notebook
i don’t see, dearest, how my presence—but no matter
here you have your legitimation—thank you so much
they make special note of his services in the brochure

the more secret they were the more one needed a third party, a confidant, a good man, to whom, with whom one could talk about them-and i was that man
but he had to answer the same question several times, every other day really, and finally, with some impatience in his voice, he tried to settle the issue once and for all, declaring that as far as he knew no one was planning to depart—people didn’t normally leave here that abruptly
and turn again to the lord!
she once had an even greater triumph—over pastor trieschke from berlin, whose nickname was teary trieschke, because every sunday he would begin to weep at some point in his sermon
now the pastor turns to the two godparents and instructs them as to their duties
she said it herself: things, events, experiences, good fortune, love, and pain were not being given their due if they remained mute and were merely enjoyed or endured
it turned out that these growths were of purely inorganic origin and arose with the aid of chemicals that came from blessed messengers pharmacy
the band was playing a polka
only settembrini showed no response
he watched her, his eyebrows raised—his small, deep-set eyes weary and sad, but also betraying the extraordinary suspense of this moment
we did not know this
n s s t d!
they then took the elevator down
because hans castorp was not on a restricted diet—why should he have been?
a brick, half a brick, gentlemen!
i would never have thought you capable of wounding me like this
my dear friends, this was no wretched crank-box, the old-fashioned sort with a turntable and stylus on top, plus a misshapen, trumpetlike brass appendage, the sort of thing you might have found at one time set up on a tavern counter to fill unsophisticated ears with nasal braying
at the point where, or so it appears, you consider illness to be so elegant or—as you put it—so venerable’ that there is absolutely no rhyme or reason’ why it and stupidity should belong together

hans castorp was more or less familiar with the plot, knew the rough outline of the tragic fate of radames, amneris, and aida, who sang to him from the cabinet—an incomparable tenor, a stately mezzo with that splendid break in the middle of her register, and a silvery soprano
sky of blue or meadow-land, but as -thou sky of blue,
the common man at any rate has never done so
in the most ticklish situation he had managed—with good grace and quite impromptu—a vindication of drink; he had, moreover, just in passing, brought the conversation around to civilization, of which, to be sure, little was evident in mynheer peeperkorn’s primitive, menacing pose; and finally, by asking his question, had relaxed that grandiose pose—it would have been quite inappropriate to respond with a raised, clenched fist
as they moved into the smoking room, herr kesselmeyer remarked cheerfully, you had a pleasant journey, i hope, consul buddenbrook?
a respectable, christian gentleman, her husband said
i don’t understand—it’s better for such things to be used by the family

his curious fellow citizens could find no answer to such questions in those blue eyes under their reddish-blond brows; and hans castorp, being an unwritten page, would probably have had no answer, either
pharmacology and toxicology were one and the same thing—we were healed by poisons, and a substance considered an agent of life could, under certain circumstances, in a single convulsion kill within seconds
there was a flare of blinding white, and all the night-eyes squinted stupidly
no, my dear mama, i am not asking you for a written blessing of our union, for i shall be leaving for home the day after tomorrow

just as tony had expected, and indeed wanted, the wedding festivities were carried out with no great to-do
his graying beard was cut round and full; he had terribly bushy eyebrows and a long, spongy nose
his friend was named kai, count kai mölln—a boy from an aristocratic family, but whose appearance was totally unkempt
and as for the private discussion he hoped to have with director behrens, he was granted his wish on the sixth day

whatever hopes he might have were just as easily fulfilled or disappointed here as on some schatzalp or other

he turned each word over in his little, toothless, mobile mouth before uttering it with incredible effort

i told you no!
the contrast between his very unkempt appearance and the noble pedigree in the delicate bone structure of his face with its slightly aquiline nose and slightly pursed upper lip was more striking than ever

a man named uzzah had thoughtlessly touched the chest, the so-called ark of the covenant, when it threatened to slip off the cart on which it was being transported, and had immediately fallen over dead
or was that brief burst of laughter-which he would release, more in mockery than amazement, after the last ding-dong echo had died away on the evening breeze and which i would know so well later, too-was it meant to say that he could see through the little song's construct, which is simply that the start of the melody is pitched in sequence by the second voice, so that the third part can serve as the bass for both?
summer vacation at the shore!

one can say of the town-and i really would rather speak in past tenses, since it is the kaisersaschern we knew in our youth of which i speak-one can say of the town that it had preserved a strong sense of the medieval, not just in outward appearance, but also in atmosphere
even though it was performed in frankfurt, a city whose spirit was one of the most easygoing and open in the reich, it goes without saying that this did not happen without angry protests and loud, embittered claims that art was being mocked, a musical crime perpetrated, without charges of nihilism and (to employ the most common term of abuse at the time)

you have the mind of a child, tony, he said despondently, pleading with her
and what gives you the right to act that way?

nor was he consumptive, or at most, like almost everyone else, had had a touch of tuberculosis in early youth
and she opens her eyes wide, or even bats them, and replies, he loves me so much
at first he would whip his head around indignantly each time and with angry eyes follow the latecomer to her place at the good russian table, even scold her under his breath, rebuking her between his teeth with a cry of outraged protest
outside the concert hall i ran into a gentleman from the kridwiss circle, professor gilgen holzschuher, the durer expert, who had been in the hall as well
he had been certain that he would sink into sleep at once, but it turned out he was wrong, and whereas he had barely been able to keep his eyes open before, they simply would not remain closed now, but kept fluttering open restlessly the moment he shut them
he regretted the end of each, but his consolation was that very soon, in two or two and a half hours, he would be sitting there again—and once he sat down it would be as if he had never stood up

was the symphonic tone-painting in one movement
for him the beginning of all things had its music-it was the music of the beginning and likewise the beginning of music, the £-flat major triad of the surging depths of the rhine, the seven primitive �hords, like cyclopean stones hewn from primeval rock, out of which the fortress of the gods rose up
for it is indeed the case that this astute, true, and super-clever music is constantly, painfully wooing the melody of folk song-a melody forever unrealized, both there and not there, appearing as fragmented sound and vanishing again within a musical style spiritually alien to it, but out of which it still constantly attempts to give birth
it hurts a great deal—but go with god’s blessing, gerda, and with our thanks for not having left earlier, when thomas died
frau chauchat had likewise dressed for the occasion and was wearing a new gown, or at least a gown that hans castorp had never seen on her—of thin, dark, almost black silk that sometimes took on a tawny shimmer; the rounded cut of the neck was small, almost girlish, barely deep enough to expose the throat or even a hint of the collarbone—or her protruding neck bones visible beneath a few stray hairs when she thrust her head forward in that special way

he was probably forty years old, a fat man, not pot-bellied, but with fat, soft limbs and white, well-padded hands; he had a clean-shaven, round face with a double chin, strongly defined, arched eyebrows, and, behind those horn-rimmed glasses, almond-shaped eyes full of melting mediterranean merriment
they sat opposite one another, their faces illumined by an electric table lamp with a red shade
the sty is not pretty, although i don’t suppose she always has one
my cousin is checking right now
indeed, hans castorp did not feel he was required to pay any regard to such aberrations, evidently they lay beyond the limits set by an uneasy conscience demanding that he at least try to be influenced—and its demands were indeed audible, so audible that whenever herr settembrini would sit down with them or join them in the open air, he would ask the italian to expand on his ideas
first-class case, he said
i know that what you got yesterday was a kick in the pants, wasn’t it?

the consul, who has also turned pale with fright, begins to scold him, and even his grandfather raps indignantly on the table, forbidding him any such foolish pranks

the baby had been given to the gray sisters in bamberg, but from then on the mother had been nothing more than a gray young miss herself, and with her only company a canary bird and a turtle her parents had given her out of pity, she had withered away in her room from consumption-but, then, the seed of it had probably always been inside her
but the difference is that back then there was such a to-do about it, and everyone was pushing me and torturing me, and now they’re all so quiet and still about it, simply assuming that i’ll say yes

well, i for one think very highly of my profession
we will do it on a saturday-as far as i know you have no classes on saturday this semester
but at the start of the new month, bad weather set in—damp, gloomy days, with a mixture of snow and rain, then snow, clear and simple; and except for an occasional splendid burst of summer, the bad weather continued for the rest of the month and on into september

under the impetus of brain and of motor nerves extending from the spine, belly and rib cage stirred, the pleuroperitoneal cavity swelled and contracted; the breath, warmed and moistened by mucous membranes along the trachea and laden with secreted material, streamed out between the lips, now that oxygen had bonded with the hemoglobin in the blood deep in the air sacs of the lungs

she looped her arm around him, so to speak, not around his shoulders, but around his head, her hand resting on his brow, and then with her black eyes directed at kretzschmar and still speaking to him in her sweet, resonant voice, she rested adrian's head on her breast
she died when i was still small
whenever frau permaneder came to visit her sister-in-law, she would draw her nephew close to her and tell him about the buddenbrooks’ past and about their future, a future for which they would have only him, little johann, to thank—and, of course, god in his mercy

fine, but what does that really mean?
she was all alone in the world, too, having left her husband and children—as she freely admitted to the cousins—for another man (still half a boy), only to be left in turn by her lover

what i also foresee is some sense of emptiness that is sure to be mine once i have added a few words accounting for the close of this great composer's life and have put the final stroke of the pen to my manuscript
so was i and i’ll go on speaking more or less poetically, too—because the moment seems to call for it, that’s why i am speaking this way
it just seemed that way to me
a thousand thanks for your letter telling me about armgard von schilling’s engagement to herr von maiboom of pöppenrade

the young man arrived about ten o’clock in the morning and had a bite to eat with the family in the parlor
we others stayed a little longer
and if the people at his own table did not make much fuss about the end of his isolation, how could anyone else in the dining hall have done so?

the labels in the middle of the ebonite disks were different colors, but otherwise the eye could not differentiate them
we should join at the first opportunity
and even frau stöhr, who as a woman of principle had likewise held her ground and met head-on every temptation to make her own wild departure, had remarked to her tablemates that krokowski had really been rather obscure today with his classical mushroom
the man made it clear, however, that he fancied himself a specialist whose activities had to take place backstage, with only the results of his endeavors displayed for pious review by the bereaved—all of which aroused hans castorp’s mistrust
when will you be back?
to be sure, we’ll do everything possible and feasible

her reddish hair, which swept back high on her head in a little crowning swirl and lay in broad, carefully coiffed waves over her ears, matched well with her extraordinary soft white complexion and the few little freckles
this, then, was fräulein brand, elly, the friendly little danish girl, who rode a bike and used to sit on an office swivel stool—and there were things about her that no one would have even dreamed possible on first or second glance at that shining face, but that began to emerge within only a few weeks after her arrival up here and that dr krokowski saw as his task to uncover in all their strangeness
he wears the ceremonial ruff of what has been, and you put on austere black in his honor
he’s not the sort of man who is out for a lot of money
she bent toward him, bent down to him, over him, he sensed her organic aroma, sensed the lacelike pounding of her heart
your themes-they almost always consist of even values, of half, quarter, eighth notes; they are syncopated and tied, to be sure, but nonetheless persevere in what is often a machinelike, stamping, hammering inflexibility and inelegance
you offered me eight percent, and i gave you your extension

nor would i forget that we marched off to war at the time with a comparatively pure heart and did not believe our previous behavior at home had been such that a bloody global catastrophe need be regarded as the inevitable logical consequence of our domestic conduct
there was a double door, with clothes hooks in the space between the two
no one would guess that is supposed to mean you
ah, gentlemen, nothing could be easier!
we cannot leave it at just the three of us, we shall need company
you’re right, hans castorp said
forgive me, madam, for speaking so candidly
they sat as if spellbound, and when the sounds of departure had died away outside, zur hohe was once again heard to utter his peremptory, beautiful!
then with a tip and a stumble it headed for the p, pulled away, and moved to the o what was it going to spell?

but enough of adrian's participation in munich's highlife!
he’ll give the child an entire table service of pure gold and won’t even let us thank him for it
he knew that his wife and i were old friends, and that i’m your sister, and since he was in such straits, he had his wife do his work for him, and in turn she has enlisted me—you see?

not daring to stir, he lay there with his hands folded—and was allowed to watch
the consul listened as long as there was music to be heard
but what we should do, damn it, is to sit ourselves down and accomplish something, just as our forebears did
the signature beneath these proclamations was that of an entity named christus imperator maximus, an energy who enlisted and commanded troops prepared to die in the cause of subjugating the globe, who issued bulletins much like orders of the day, reveled in laying down implacable stipulations, proclaimed poverty and chastity, and could not get enough of unquestioned, unbounded obedience to his fist-pounding demands

and pribislav said nothing at all, simply gave the mechanism a quick check and shoved the holder into his pocket
it was such a lovely, festive, absolutely extraordinary evening—they all understood and felt it, and for now no one would even think of making use of the gift of life called sleep
it was indicated from several sides that they should withdraw a little from these noisy precincts for the purpose, so that they could enjoy their picnic relieved of this racket and not as deaf-mutes
so all gifts are to be returned?
that may sound bizarre, but it is far from improbable or unprecedented, and given certain conditions it can happen to any of us at any time; under such conditions, nothing could prevent us from sinking into profound ignorance about the passage of time and so about our own age
the most important factor, to be sure, was the easy, refined, and irresistibly charming way he had of embodying that history and turning it to his own account

who easily shed good-hearted tears when she laughed and frequently nodded to her niece in order to repeat-her face damp, her voice wobbling-one of her neighbor's humorous comments that in her opinion she simply had to share
but it proved impossible for her to keep her word, because now and then her path inevitably led her either past the display windows of the shops in the back building, which had been leased almost immediately at very handsome rents, or past the venerable gabled façade itself, where now the name of consul hermann hagenström stood just beneath the dominus providebit
cheers on all sides
he came in a bell-shaped pleated coat, not in the latest fashion but of the best quality, lending him an air of solidity and dignity—and smiling and pink-faced as always, his thinning hair carefully combed, his whiskers curled and scented
to let yourself get discouraged over something like that—
madame buddenbrook was silent for a moment
she’d be in completely over her head
in a jocular, everyday sort of way, surely-with ''i am certainly curious to hear about it or something of the sort
who would have expected that of him?
the harbor pilot said in a gruff voice, turning to herr grünlich
sticking out from the short sleeves, his hands were always a pale gray, as if impregnated with dust and dirt; but they were narrow and exceptionally fine hands, with long fingers and long, tapering fingernails
half sitting up in bed, with mighty shoulders and majestic head turned toward his visitor, he stretched one arm out across the bedclothes and held his freckled captain’s hand erect at the end of the woolen sleeve, forming a precise ring of thumb and forefinger, thrusting the other finger lances in the air; and his mouth formed the words as sharply and exactly, as graphically in fact, as herr settembrini himself might have wished, and he added a throaty rolled r to words like difference and occurred
in this connection, moreover, it came as a matter of fleeting surprise to learn that in his youth rudi had been forced to undergo an operation that cost him one of his kidneys
i shall be ruthless

i made serious inquiries about my son-in-law
he feigned a couple of steps in the direction of the dining room, then held back as his eyes searched for his mother, who was bringing up the rear at the side of pastor wunderlich and about to cross the threshold

but they add up, bethsy!
it’s probably some of the good china
and after they’ve done that for a year or so, if all goes well, the lung will have rested long enough to heal
breathing heavily and not rightly knowing how he had got there, hans castorp found himself lying in the splendid lounge chair on his balcony—because there was a rest cure between dinner and tea, the most important of the day, in fact, and rigorously enforced
their grief was sincere, for they all had been fond of poor, saucy, proud clarissa
i will not dwell on the foolish stubbornness of your continuing to use my first name and informal pronouns
leverkiihn, deutschlin said in reply, has his own thoughts about youth, but he also apparently regards it as a specific form of life to be respected as such, and that's decisive
hans castorp had the impression that the latter was the case and that these sparkling trills and grace notes of laughter were due solely to childish giddiness and silly ignorance—and he did not approve

one ought not, therefore, be all too distressed even by gross symptoms
hans castorp could only respond with the brief, stiff, and uneasy bow of a schoolboy on the receiving end of a critical lecture
studying?—oh, and playing the piano?
director behrens had not come, having presumably said his good-byes to her on some other private occasion
things might be different awake; maybe in looking for inner support he would do well to give settembrini’s novel nature a try—rebellious and critical, though sentimental and bombastic, too

god and nature were both unjust, they had their favorites, chose to be gracious at random, adorned one man with precarious honors and the next with an easy, but ordinary fate
with his blue eyes, rudolf observed adrian's preoccupation, saw how he checked himself and turned away
your ladder is pure orient
the consul came close to shouting, and then dampened his voice with a glance toward the dining room
the golden tree of life is green,  true, but a green face is really not quite the thing
i’m no millionaire, but what i have is well invested
as an idealist of the pathological, if not to say a pathological idealist, such a man will see himself at the starting point of a sequence of thought that very quickly flows into the problem of being-in-general—that is to say, into the problem of the relationship between mind and matter
this took place at the waldfriedhof cemetery in munich and was attended by everyone in the radde's circle of friends

dr krokowski’s baritone called him calmly and solemnly by name and repeated his command
but although hans castorp was usually repelled by tangled and squalid affairs and even felt repelled in this instance as well, he continued to splash about in these murky waters, taking consolation in the certainty that he was here only on a visit and would soon be leaving
sad to say, you guessed correctly about my not knowing the writings of that pope—i assume innocent the third was a pope
his embarrassment was unnecessary, because no one noticed him
no, no … no, my friend, no chance
he’s homesick for the sea, gerda buddenbrook remarked
it’s all a bit mysterious
when i first had to take to my bed, i wrote them that i had a bad cold and could not travel
the educational system, in its clever subtlety, both met and encouraged his own natural tendencies
herr stuht, a tailor on glockengiesser strasse, whose wife bought used articles of clothing and so moved in the highest social circles—herr stuht, whose woolen shirt followed the contours of his astounding potbelly and fell down over his trousers—herr stuht had made two suits of clothes for the young messrs buddenbrook, at a total cost of seventy marks courant; except that, at the express wish of the two boys, he promptly agreed to make out a bill for eighty, handing back the difference to them in cash
then he gave a deep sigh and sat up straight
finally succumbing to hunyadi-janos water, he had left his daughter an annuity of two hundred marks a year and relied on general respect for the name döhlmann to ensure that she would be admitted into the johannis cloister
already reserved, dear mama, already reserved, herr grünlich replied
it is true that his moist eyes were laughing all the while, and apparently he saw the situation from its humorous side, but that was no consolation for everyone else, and ultimately one could not blame the public for avoiding these lectures-and with such unanimity that indeed several times only about a half dozen listeners occupied some front seats, namely: my parents, adrian's uncle, young cimabue, and the two of us, plus a couple of pupils from the girls' academy, who never failed to titt�r during the speaker's faltering seizures
but then settembrini continued with dignity, ah, no, i am a european, an occidental
yes, as an unsalaried engineer-in-training
and so three days had passed since the bill for his second week had been taken care of with a thank-you and a receipt—which is the same thing as saying that he was now in the middle of the third and last week of his scheduled stay up here
it is the angel of each single creature, the genius of its life, whose knowledgeable guidance it gladly trusts
he now lived the life of a private gentleman, but was a little ashamed of the fact; and so he constantly pretended to have more to do than he could possibly keep up with
after all, his face had something puggish about it, his voice was guttural, and there was more of the boy than of the man about him-though i will gladly grant the lovely blue of his eyes, his trim figure, and his captivating violin playing and whistling, not to mention his general niceness
but it upsets me to see such confusion—what with the one preaching about an international world republic and loathing war on principle, but at the same time so patriotic that the brenner pass is the only possible border and he’s willing to fight a civilizing war over it; and the other claiming the nation-state is the devil’s own work and gushing about the unification of all mankind, only to turn around and defend the law of natural instincts and make fun of peace conferences
but this acrimony with my brother, your eldest son, father—let us not have a hidden crack that runs through the edifice we have built with god’s gracious help
when inez's dignity was at issue
he did not want rudolf to make
but then he started up, looking about in befuddlement, like someone rudely awakened from sleep
it involves us all, and if it ends in disgrace, we shall all be affected, because weinschenk is part of the family after all—he sits at our table
you’re a writer, hans castorp said, a literary man
his uncle, nikolaus leverkiihn, his father's brother and a respected citizen of kaisersaschern, consented to take the boy in
all of which proceeds from the later beethoven and his polyphony, and i find it extraordinarily significant that the foes of romanticism-to wit: of art stepping forward out of mere musicality and into the realm of the general intellect-were likewise always foes and lamenters of beethoven's later development
strasse i n a low-slung, rubber-wheeled pram of the most elegant construction, pushed along by their wet-nurse (for inez did not nurse them herself; her physician had advised against it), a simple woman all gussied up in bourgeois finery
more recently, dr krokowski treated this patient no differently from the way he treated all others
who wants to play with us?
home from his walk, hans castorp consulted him—and he promptly climbed to
the director said with a genial laugh
do you see what a sackful of rascals it is?-was how he would usually conclude his indictment, being far better at words than the lawyer, who would angrily withdraw behind his newspaper after a few braying attempts at protest
could not help it?
the idea that youth has a closer relationship to nature than a man matured by bourgeois society-rather like a woman, for instance, who is said to have a greater affinity to nature in comparison with a man
the man had covered the walls of his cell with verses
then she looked back up at the maid’s flushed face, read it again, and looked at the maid’s face again
he never spoke of higher things, but simply stuck to the facts, and it was a delight to listen to him—particularly for hans castorp, who thought it useful to hear about the russian empire and the life lived there, about samovars, piroshki, cossacks, and wooden churches with so many onion-shaped steeples that they looked like mushroom colonies
it spoke well of the spiritual quality of his superiors that his protests and doubts in no way prejudiced the irregard for him
i am a simple man, he said
do you always mock the people who lay themselves at your feet?
i defend it today as well, he replied
and in the brief, worthless time in between, there was a walk to the bench up on the mountain slope, right next to the water trough—the path was teeming with patients, so that the cousins frequently had to greet people
in its own way, the other contains a great deal of human dignity, too, and contributes to moral conduct and decorum and noble formality, certainly more than freethinking’ does—and always with an eye to human weakness and frailty
freedom is the freedom to sin, and piety consists in making no use of freedom out of love for god, who had to grant it
things that have a certain insipid optimism, which, if you found them in a book, would prompt you to cast it with amused anger or total outrage into the nearest corner
his hands behind his back, the senator examined the plaque for a long time
but i wanted to wait, he went on
as they left, young fritz wept a little again, and although it was only out of weakness, the tears he shed stood in curious contradiction to the dry, businesslike way he spoke and thought
for adrian leverkiihn these were years of highly excited and enormous-one is tempted to say, monstrous-creative activity, a kind of tumult that swept even sympathetic bystanders before it, and one could not avoid the impression that it was intended as payment, as compensation for his having been deprived of happiness in life, for having been denied permission to love
that would seem really too strange
her parents, retired major gerngross and his wife, were likewise touched and pleased, but since they had no friends whatever in the house, they could not even hazard a guess as to the givers
but hygiene is probably not the only reason for friction, i would say
in exquisite, perfectly enunciated words, he deplored the cold and damp, which were a bitter affliction for him
the moment behrens returns, they will all throw themselves on their lounge chairs
kai was lost in his own thoughts
no doubt there would also be hygienic arguments for maintaining the nation and race, when one day they would proceed to leave the sick unattended on a large scale and kill the feeble-minded and those incapable of survival, whereas in reality (it was not to be denied, on the contrary, it must be emphasized) it would be a matter of far more profound decisions, of the renunciation of all humane pampering and emasculation, which had been the work of the bourgeois epoch-a matter of mankind's instinctively getting into shape for hard and dark times that would scoff at humanity, for an age of great wars and sweeping revolution, presumably leading far back beyond the christian civilization of the middle ages and restoring instead the dark ages that preceded its birth and had followed the collapse of the culture of antiquity
but arm your hearts and minds with mistrust, never let your critical resistance down
from him he got his charcoal-burner’s faith in reason, freedom, human progress, and the whole moth-eaten classicistic-bourgeois ideology of virtue
but being unpracticed in such discursive reasoning and anything but intellectually alert after his unsalutary walk, he was easily diverted, and was in fact diverted almost immediately by the round back in front of him and by the arm extending from it, which lifted and reached back, so that the hand—now right before hans castorp’s eyes—could tuck at the braid of hair
some people go to spain then, but you’ll be returning to your bandera, to perform distinguished service above and beyond the call of duty
why she keeps saying man alive,  i really don’t know
the intruding shrieks of fear, however, took form, closed ranks, became a melody—and then came the moment when they achieved mastery as a fervent, plaintive chorus of woodwinds raised in strong yet humble song
i wouldn’t want to be on it, he added after a pause
these humane minds were disgusted by the idea of wealth increasing automatically and placed all speculation and transactions involving interest under the rubric of usury, making every rich man either a thief or the heir of a thief
then he heaved a sigh and said, i will not attempt to gloss over the specific forms life’s natural cruelty takes in your society
they were all in on it
it was dr ting-fu who came up with the sound idea of turning on the ceiling light—and at once the room was bathed in bright clarity
you speak my deepest sentiments, herr grünlich, she said
and now you want to stage it yourself, is that it?
this is what happened: after three months of treatment at the hosslin clinic, where i was allowed to see my friend only seldom and always for just a few minutes, he had calmed down-i do not say improved, but calmed down-to a degree that enabled the doctor to consent to private care in the quiet of pfeiffering
the chimes of st mary’s began their chorale—dong!-ding-dong!—with so little rhythm that it was not quite clear which hymn it was, though it was full of solemnity, and while the smaller and the larger bells—one merry, the other grave—tolled four o’clock, the bell in the vestibule below rang shrilly through the entrance hall
but if the kingdom is to come, the dualism between good and evil, between this world and the next, between power and the spirit, must be temporarily abrogated and transformed in a principle that unites asceticism and dominion
you had a right to be called, she said
she's had her fill of town and people and society, of ladies and gents,
at the door, they ran into a delegation of sailors, led by two helmsmen from the wullenwever and the friederike oeverdieck, the firm’s two ships now lying moored at the docks
he returned to his home
you seem to take some sort of pleasure in this, don’t you?
a new breakthrough seemed due, the breakthrough that would make us a dominant world power-which, to be sure, could not be effected by moral homework
chairs and ice-buckets were upended
ah, ah, comme c'est melancolique, tout ra!
tame isabeau was enchanted to see him again
no motion, if there were no time?
i am convinced that the gray sisters are more loyal, more devoted, and more self-sacrificing than those nurses in black
he would arrive, for instance, just in time carefully to spoon her midday porridge into her mouth, to help her drink from her spouted cup if a bite got stuck in her throat, or to assist her in shifting position in bed—for, in addition to all her other problems, an incision from an operation made it difficult for her to lie down
his mother, madame buddenbrook, however, took the matter in hand, pulling grabow aside to ask, just between us, doctor, something must be done, don’t you think?
i can tell you in two words
then he stood up and bowed silently, extending a hand to herr pfühl, who let his hand pass gently and lovingly across hanno’s hair, which lay in soft, graceful curls along his brow and at his temples
yes, ida, the consul says, i’ve been thinking about it, and mother has agreed
although one ought to be fair and admit that he alone, and not the lord, has provided the impetus behind the good fortunes of the firm of strunck & hagenström
after eight to ten days spent doing nothing but smoking cigars, hugo weinschenk began to read newspapers and write letters
they were on their way to their offices and shops, not in all that much of a hurry, nothing was threatening them
these ladies and gentlemen were put up in the house, and ida jungmann had her hands full tidying up the various bedrooms and tending to good breakfasts of shrimps and port wine—the kitchen was busy with baking and roasting
russians love to go for rides, joachim told hans castorp as they stood together at the front door and amused themselves by watching people depart
so be man's wrong how ever great,
the essence of the situation remains what it has been since the beginning, a physical struggle, and it is each man’s duty, however far he may be from nature, to keep himself equal to this situation
one day he said, there’s something else i must tell you: i have a complete skeleton in my room in göttingen
when by chance at one point in the social ebb and flow, a group formed of marie, adrian, myself, and a fourth party, i moved off at once in the hope that the fourth would have enough sense to go his own way as well
your mother may find release in the next five minutes, or this may go on for hours yet
come back soon, you old muttonhead!
hot on their heels came a series of hymns, to be sung to familiar european chorales, appearing in print under such titles as tones of divine love and praise, jacob's place of struggle and knighthood, and zion 's hill of incense
a good one, say i, an it be not too dear
and he recalled the calm, generous reply of oh, please, go ahead and look, that he had once received out of the dark night of the x-ray laboratory, when he had thought it necessary to ask permission to commit certain optical indiscretions
you enter the fray unarmed against such intellectual chicanery
yes, i expected to see that face, he said
i had only to deliver the invitation to an excursion, not propose marriage
he sank down onto a bench in the pose of a man who has lost the battle of waterloo, pressing a clenched fist to his brow, rolling his eyes blasphemously, and repeating several times over: ha, curses!
and he devoted the same deadly earnest to planning a business maneuver or outlining a speech as he did to contemplating a complete refurbishing of his supply of underwear—to do it at last in one fell swoop, so that at least in that regard everything would be in perfect order for a while
unwilling to accommodate himself to such failure, he struggled for a while to find a pleasure that either was totally denied him or simply teased him with a distant inkling of itself, and finally out of weary disgust he tossed the cigar aside
and he was about to add:
he hugged ida, looked around with eyes still wet with tears, contentedly murmured something about aunt tony, shifted in his bed, and then quietly fell asleep
believe me—believe this if nothing else—if father were alive, if he were here with us today, he would fold his hands and commend us all to the mercy of god
christian, too, had been roused from his bed upstairs and was sitting off to one side, his back turned to the four-poster, his head buried in his hands
one must have them
on the one hand, he is incapable of keeping his composure when other people are tactless and naïve
and yet one could offer her only bitter thanks for that
all the same, after the duel with that devil he had one of his fits of laughter out on the street, and it subsided only slowly under the diversion of conversation
and if you have formed a different opinion of me, you can go to hell, to pot, or to the dogs—take your pick
and i also got tangled up in my own oratory because the whole time i had the feeling that it was inappropriate for me to hold forth like that in adrian's presence
for the second time the storm of this man’s emotions rushed over him, and there certainly seemed something genuine about the way he expressed them; it was the same awful threat he had heard that day when he told herr grünlich about the letter his daughter had sent from travemünde, and once again a shudder passed through him—like any man of his generation, he felt a fanatical reverence for all human emotions that stood at odds with his sober and practical outlook as a man of business
his union with her was based on mutual understanding, consideration, and silence
the ratio between our real estate and our liquid capital is all out of balance
he did it even with me, even with women, who usually did not dislike it
i wish you could change seats with me so you could observe her as easily and effortlessly as i can
the portrait of clavdia chauchat was hung in the living room, next to the window—hans castorp had spied it with one quick glance as he entered the room, although it bore only a very distant resemblance to her
as we turned back to the village, we watched the sun set, and i never have seen a splendor of the evening sky to match it
he looked directly into our faces, observing our mirth with roguish curiosity-particularly at mine, it seemed, since he probably wanted to check whether, for my own good, my preposterous dull and stern pedagogy had thawed out
we have to extract the roots
but he only laughed derisively as he walked away, and within a few minutes he returned with his revolver
tony’s tears gradually dried
but then he fell silent again and thought: hmm, hmm, serious news
our feeling, you see, is our manly vigor, which awakens life
whereby the eyes' darkness is deepened all the more by the low pitch, the flash of light within it, given this time, however, to the piccolo
you get the details right, and bungle the larger effect
he did not ask whether we understood this, nor did we ask ourselves
you lay bedridden with pneumonia for six weeks, and here you are sitting without an overcoat, without even a blanket, and smoking cigarettes
and what was dr krokowski talking about?
herr grünlich praised the house’s elegant grounds, praised the town in general, praised the consul’s cigar as well, had a kind word for everyone
the drooping bags of skin under her jet-black eyes were larger and heavier than any he had ever seen
she held her cup clasped in both hands; her face vanished into the cup, and she gulped at her milk, pausing now and then for little enthusiastic sighs
and as for her profile, his tablemate forbade him ever to say such a thing again
everything that hans castorp had anticipated—and all too hastily put into words for herr settembrini as they returned from platz that afternoon before mardi gras—was well on its way to being fulfilled
then weariness and disgust would rise up inside him, clouding his eyes, robbing him of control over his proud posture and the muscles in his face
she dressed in much the same fashion as sesame, but unlike her was extremely tall
after that, he threw himself with redoubled fervor into the arms of the clear-eyed goddess, about whose soothing powers director behrens had so many virtuous things to say; and the problem that consumed his every thought day and night, to which he devoted all the persistence, all the sportsman’s tenacity he had once brought to the conviction of poor sinners—back in the days before his frequently extended leave of absence, which now threatened to become permanent retirement—that problem was nothing less than the squaring of the circle
he led them upstairs and down, showing them the rooms on the third floor and those that opened off the corridor on the second, as well as the layout of the ground floor, even the kitchen and the cellar
but hanno had not stopped laughing; he was still laughing so hard on the stairs that classmates in his and kai’s vicinity stared at him in cool amazement, were even a little repulsed by such foolishness
and out of concern for psychological needs, especially in the case of such a man, one does not even think of physical calmatives and sedatives, of the bromides that were in the house
never, in fact, hans castorp said
i’m so glad, so tremendously glad that things are taking this serene course, and that he will not have to suffer edema of the glottis and other such beastly problems—he will be spared a great many vexations
hans castorp—head over heels in love, as people say, and yet not in the happy sense of the idiom, but as one loves when it is forbidden and unreasonable, when there are no calm little songs from the flatlands to be sung, terribly in love, dependent, subjugated, suffering and serving—was nevertheless a man who remained shrewd enough amid his slavery to know exactly what his devotion was worth, and would continue to be worth, to the slinking patient with the enchanting tartar slits; and she could be constantly reminded of its worth, or so he told himself despite his suffering subjugation, by the behavior of herr settembrini, who only too openly confirmed her own suspicions by attitudes as dismissive toward her as humanistic courtesy allowed
and it was quite reprehensible for two or three like-minded girlfriends to appear at the door of the elderly lady who sold woolen dolls in the narrow alley off johannis strasse—although, admittedly, she did have the most curious red eyes—to tug at her bell as hard as they could, and, when the old woman came out, to ask in a deceptively friendly voice whether this might be the residence of herr or madame spittoon, and then to run away screeching loudly
but first make yourselves comfortable
what he did was to sit down and compose a missive to mlle
: further, because your every other word lays bare your nothingness
even though not everything had turned out over the years quite the way one, out of shortsightedness, might have wished, she said, nevertheless there still remained such manifold and obvious blessings that their hearts should be filled with gratitude
no, no, my deepest, deepest respect
saint felix-brazil, i’ve always stuck to that sort
they had set the light, rustic, stained-wood furniture on the lawn, because it was too warm and close inside the summerhouse, a single white room whose only decoration was a tall mirror framed by fluttering birds and two enameled french doors at the rear—which weren’t real; if you looked closely you could see that the handles were just painted on
take for instance the role thin counterpoint plays in romanticism
german i shall be, yet you, good sir, begrudge me that i should, in good durer fashion, freeze to pursue the sun-and do so e�en when, quite without regard to the sun, i have urgent business here with a fine creature well-created
because the subject came up
but, as stupid as i am, i know one thing: that you are a very different man from father, and that when you took over the business you set quite a different breeze blowing, and that since then you have done many things he would never have done
he does not appear to have investigated the doctor's sudden death any further, had no interest in the matter, it seemed
his mother had gone to see to her toilette
of course, as a man of the south, you would probably suggest poison or a dagger or at the least shape the matter along social and emotional lines, in short, have me play cock of the walk

wasservogel had it easy in life, because most of the teachers were quick to praise him for his achievements—just to prove to themselves and the other boys that they would never let his ugliness tempt them to be unjust
and i don’t think it’s out of the question that we’ll learn a thing or two out of this
and all stuffed full with merchandizes, and the people thronging there gaze upon you with exotic eyes and speak in tongues of which you ne'er have heard a sound before
i want to have a home and someone who will show some sympathy when i am ill and we’re well suited to each other
poor hans castorp—what an error his earlier assumption had been upon first making the acquaintance of those arms through thin gossamer: that once bared, bared against all good reason, those arms would affect him less deeply without the seductive radiant illusion of fabric, as he had called it that day
tony sat down at the secretary—its top was rolled back; she clasped her hands behind her head and stared for a while out into the courtyard, its black cobblestones glistening with rain, and at the damp garden, its green turned to yellow now
he was deeply moved by what he saw, or more accurately, by being able to see it, but he was also stung by secret doubts whether it might not be somehow abnormal after all, doubts about whether it was permissible to stare like this amid the quivering, crackling darkness
i urge you: consider your self-respect, your pride
and before one even thought about it, the moment had come for the robust knock of the bath attendant, announcing that the daily schedule was in force once again
life’s holy, feminine demands upon our manly honor and vigor—

the consul drew on his cigar till it glowed, leaned his head back, and let out the smoke
in every vital movement there are demonic forces hidden alongside the ordering qualities
one cannot say, however, that adrian was unqualifiedly receptive to the little boy's wishes
we have to do something!

after all its ordeals, the motif, this d-g-g, undergoes a gentle transformation
but do not think less of them for it!
and in a beleaguered voice she blurted, what does that man want from me!
she didn’t answer, didn’t even look at him—but silently moved the upper part of her body a little closer to him on their cushion of sand, and morten kissed her slowly and formally on the mouth
i came on business … but who could resist
it did not appear as if any such objections had found their way to our host
the liibeck production of love 's labour's lost, as unsuccessful as it had been, together with the mere existence of the brentano cycle, had had its own quiet effect and had begun to lend adrian's name a certain esoteric, if rather tentative renown in the innermost circles of art-though even that was hardly the case in germany and not at all in munich, but only in other, more receptive places
he had to complete it all on his own, and he did so
and your good cousin should measure, too
and all the while there sat feddermann at his desk, big as life, flicking peas in all directions
but adrian apparently intended to use precisely these
scrambling over the slippery rocks, the visitors moved closer now, and stood there wet with spray, wrapped in misty vapor, their ears crammed and sated with noise; they exchanged glances and intimidated smiles; they shook their heads and watched the spectacle, this continuous catastrophe of hurling foam, with its deafening, insane, extravagant roar that frightened and confused them, baffled their ears
i assume it’s of no further importance
but for now, it was i who had been entrusted with a message and i gladly carried out my assignment
she paid him no regard, but he devoured her at close range with eyes full of profound sadness
karoline stöhr was a dreadful person
in short, she confessed a painful distrust of his seriousness, his professions of sympathy, his attentions-when you were sick, for instance, and he would come to see you
morten stared in bewilderment at the gentleman’s pink face—and muttonchops that looked as if they had been powdered with the same dust used to gild walnuts at christmas
of all the teachers, he demanded the most discipline; his critical eyes would pass down the rows of students, who had to stand at attention and provide sharp, curt answers to his questions
and hans castorp had flinched
and in your ignorance, your gaze falters, for no organ, no internal sense, can tell you for sure
ultimately it contained no less than seven hundred seventy hymns, including some with a vast number of stanzas
and of course they could not conceal—indeed, found it irresponsible to be silent about—the fact that little johann was horribly slow learning to walk and talk
broad the waves, thomas buddenbrook said, ah, see them surging, watch them breaking, ever surging, ever breaking, on they come in endless rows, bleak and pointless, filled with woes

the senator promised them a considerable bonus for the coming week and sent them on their way
you are a greater man than i but now, with a rising voice, he continued, but i shall accompany you, i shall stand at your side, consul buddenbrook
until now, such phrases had been known to come only from the mouth of the late consul
ah, i’m convinced that he halfway knew about his partner’s dealings, that he was not totally ignorant of what state his warehouse was in
of the gentlemen conversing at kridwiss's not a one believed any longer in free institutions, particularly since freedom was a self-contradictory notion, insofar as in order to maintain itself freedom is forced to limit the freedom of its opponents, that is, to negate itself

and should he cry the next day in recoil: 'oh foolish desolation!
over the years, the buddenbrooks had grown accustomed to not traveling any distance during the summer, and even the previous spring, when gerda had expressed a wish to visit her father in amsterdam and play a few duets with him again after so many years, her husband had been rather curt in giving his consent
the body of sound, though not in any way distorted, had suffered a diminution in perspective; it was, if one may use a visual comparison for an audible phenomenon, as if one were gazing at a painting through the wrong end of opera glasses, so that it looked distant and small, but without forfeiting any definition of line or brilliance of color

i’ve been reading out on the beach and simply didn’t keep track of the time
there was a pause—the last flame burned lower and lower
and indeed naphta was clever at making his points, turning a hymn of praise into something diabolic and presenting himself as the incarnation of abiding, disciplined love, so that once again it had become a pure impossibility to decide where god and the devil, life and death, were to be found
but of course, joachim said
harmful and damnable influences— the consul continued
he scowled and looked clairvoyant

she both gave it to him and held it back, so that he took it without actually taking hold of it—raising his hand, very close to the pencil, his fingers ready to grasp it, but not actually grasping; and the gaze from his leaden eye sockets shifted between the object and clavdia’s tartar face
oh my, oh my—that was all very pretty, was what any honest man would have to say

a bell rang out while the music played on
let us rejoice and thank god that we haven’t yet come to the same pass as the ratenkamps back then, and that we take our leave from the house under more favorable circumstances
there was never, i will admit, a bewitching charm about any of my children

the best thing would be to introduce her personally to his family, to present her to his loving parents, jealous brothers and sisters, and judgmental aunts for their inspection, and for weeks now he had been working on the arrangements and attempting to gain their approval for such an entrevue-and reported to his sweetheart about his progress both in a series of notes and repeated trips to pforzheim
johann buddenbrook had taken no steps against his unscrupulous son-in-law
then there was a russo-german insurance agent named anton karlovitch ferge, a good-natured martyr; and the unhappy, but very flirtatious frau von mallinckrodt, who like the others received flowers and whom hans castorp had even fed porridge on several occasions, with joachim looking on
there are surely several people here who know the name
you shall have my hand on it, adrian said, when we say goodbye

he is simply phenomenal, our meister is
well, hans castorp thought, there’s a delphic remark for you
frau schweigestill put aside for now the question of price, which turned out to be very moderate, including board and maid service; she first determined with which of her two visitors that day she was dealing, the writer or the musician, learned (while obviously mulling over her impressions from that day) that this was the musician, and then expressed her misgivings about his request, solely in his own interest and from his perspectiveand this too put only in a way that suggested he ought to know what was best for him
it won’t get you anywhere—trust your uncle

very differently from what he had expected, but all was lost now
just for the pure joy of it, since he was quite alone on the meadow, he let his fingers play at the stops of a woodwind he held to his lips, a clarinet or reed pipe, from which he coaxed gentle, nasal tones, one after the other, purely at random, and yet in a satisfying sequence that rose carelessly into the deep blue sky, beneath which the foliage of a few solitary birches and ashes flickered in the sun as the breeze brushed past
i’ll just go sit on those stones back there
tony wrung her hands and pled with them: now, now, tom—now, now, christian
only one ceiling lamp was lit somewhere in the deserted lobby, and the adjoining social rooms were hardly any brighter
this room was part of a beer-and-dance hall that belonged to the widow suerkringel, but it was made available to the gentlemen of the council on certain days
this immense work does not wish to see belles-lettres neglected, either, at least to the extent that they speak of human suffering
and as a way of apologizing silently for feeling embarrassed for him, she drew his arm through hers
the mother superior would be so happy to be of service
hans castorp rolled the cylindrical coffee mill between his palms
the matter is of some concern to you, by the way, he said, turning to joachim
or when, upon realizing with whom it is she lives in tenderest wedlock, she says to him: oh my sweet son, you are my only child, you are my husband and my lord, you are both my and my brother's son, oh my sweet child, and oh thou my god, why didst thou let me be born !
with proper interest and, to be sure, some private head shaking, we took it all in and as the sky cleared continued on our way to etta!, which due to its benedictine abbey, including a baroque church, enjoys solid architectural renown
it appeared he was getting ready to set the entirety of holy writ to music written by his recipe; he was certainly the man to entertain such an idea

whether it suited him, and how he had organized his studies
it may well have been (i gladly believe it was) that in other places, in enemy and even allied lands, this short-circuiting of fate was experienced as a catastrophe and grand malheur-a phrase that, once in the field, we so often heard on the lips of french women, who, to be sure, had war on their own soil, in their parlors and kitchens: ah monsieur, ia guerre, que/ grand malheur!
but take, above all, his ironic relationship with tonality, how it vexes, desists, disavows, and hovers, its mockery of the key signature

in the days of the first mobilization, of the first declarations of war, he got into the habit of reaching out both hands to his visitor and squeezing them in his own—which deeply touched the nincompoop’s heart, if not his head
oh, he would almost have been happy if he could have called him that, thought of him as that, if he had been able to despise him as a shallow, empty-headed, and vulgar young man who was working off a normal dose of youthful energy with a little music in order to win ladies’ hearts
and she’s not all that well groomed herself, despite the plumed hat
it impeded the fever that came with digesting larger meals
those were the pleasures in life that didn’t cost a cent—it was the same, for example, with scratching your chilblains in the spring, when they itched so deliciously—and you scratched away fervently and brutally until you drew blood, just for the mad pleasure of it
till death's great toll i sometime pay
the air was heavy with sweet odors from the tidy, neatly outlined beds, and from the middle of tall purple irises the fountain sent a softly splashing jet into the darkening sky, where the first stars had begun to flicker

and he did that as well, and they all got to know one another
i’m no innocent from the country, let me tell you, and, believe me, taken just for itself and out of context, this affair with babbit would not have chased me off
his mother had died first, quite unexpectedly, while awaiting the birth of a second child, of an arterial blockage caused by phlebitis, an embolism, dr heidekind had called it, triggering instantaneous cardiac paralysis—she had been sitting up in bed, laughing, and it looked as if she simply toppled over in a fit of laughter, whereas in fact she did it because she was dead
we’ve got it down better now, but it still happens often enough that we have to pack our bags mortis causa
he was doubtless still preoccupied with what he himself had last said

after a while settembrini stopped, grasped hans castorp’s hand, laid his own other hand atop it, and said, my friend, i will not kill
my father was on the board of directors of the büchen line as far back as ’, which is probably the reason i’ve been elected to it at age thirty-two

they both stood like this for a moment, facing one another—he in a pose of honest and imperious rage; tony pale, trembling, tearful, a moist handkerchief pressed to her mouth
granted, his stiff collar and high, white necktie were old-fashioned; but such a term could never be applied to that marvelous article of clothing—he meant the spanish ruff—of which the former were merely present-day traces

we germans have acquired the term per se from philosophy and use it every day without intending anything very metaphysical
my dear son, this is a beautiful day … a beautiful day, she repeated
the suggestion that someone feel his face was not at all typical of hans castorp, and even he was embarrassed by it

in late autumn herr permaneder reappeared on meng strasse—it was decided to delay things no longer
there was no end to it
no, what do you mean?
he had not the vaguest about the artistic world of tradition found in russian and french ballet, as represented, let us say, by tchaikovsky, ravel, and stravinsky, and was not even remotely aware of ideas such as those that the latter-named russian musician later expressed about classical ballet: as a triumph of measured plan over effusive emotion, of order over chance, as a pattern of consciously apollonian action, it was the paradigm of art itself
all motion, however, is circular, hans castorp said
her hands—those white, somewhat short, but delicately shaped fingers of the buddenbrooks, with small wrists enclosed by the velvet cuffs of her sleeves—handled knife, fork, and cup with movements that for some reason seemed a little abrupt and hasty
no, hans castorp said, taking his seat again at the end of the table between the seamstress and the englishwoman and conscientiously unfolding his napkin—although he was still weighed down by his first breakfast
and what do you accuse him of?
it takes longer to get acclimatized here, to get used to all these new impressions
his pointed chin was thrust upward toward his nose in a look of wild determination, his gray hair hung ominously over brow and temples, his head was tucked so deep into his shoulders that he had finally succeeded in looking like a hunchback—and he exclaimed, behold me now, prepared to speak unto the people
but he was not a jew, and that was the positive thing about him
and he hummed them softly at first, but soon was singing at the top of his voice
i have passed on with naphta and settembrini into these dangerous mountains
but that is only a pretense
he had not known what else to do and had written his mother that he felt he must leave london and come home for her to nurse him; then he had simply quit his job and started on his way
that was the wiedemann-sonnenschein affair
he stood there, helpless and stiff with cold, steaming like a sweating horse

and might have turned the critics around as well
with the aid of a sort of metal shoehorn that she pulled from the bag hanging from her belt, she looked down into the patient’s throat, asking hans castorp to provide light with the nightstand lamp
this was the gastrula, the protozoon, the primal form of all animal life, the primal form of flesh-borne beauty
because she is a power, and it is servile to accept her, to reconcile oneself to her—that is, to reconcile oneself to her inwardly

i know that by family custom i should marry a merchant, but as a scholar morten is an equally respectable gentleman
those idealistic powers of resistance to illness and death, whose defeat by the overwhelming forces of base nature so pained herr settembrini, were absolutely alien to little naphta; and his method for coping with the deterioration of his body was not sorrow and gloom, but scornful high spirits and an unparalleled aggressiveness, a mania for intellectual doubt, negation, and confusion, all of which severely aggravated the other man’s melancholy and daily intensified their intellectual arguments
will it have sleeves?
our consent, she said after a pause—it sounded sad, even a little bitter
but it’s the same with all the families
she knew these fairy tales almost by heart—she had read them all too many times over the years—and turned the pages automatically with a moistened index finger

he could not get his fill of gazing, and yet he asked himself anxiously if he was in fact allowed to gaze upon them, if it was not a punishable crime for an outsider—who felt so ugly and clumsy and base—to spy upon such sunny, civilized happiness
yes, time is a puzzling thing, there is something about it that is hard to explain
jeannette scheurl later told me that upon adrian's return to the table from one such promenade, inez rodde had said to him:
gerda would sit on the other side of the portieres, reading a book or doing needlework, and follow the lessons
where he was going and why, was something no one else knew anything about
he’s apparently a very handsome and elegant man
letting his cigarette wander from one corner of his mouth to the other, he lifted an eyebrow and tilted his head to the side
the chipper great-aunt had invited her tablemates—that is, the cousins, the teacher, and frau stöhr—to a farewell dinner in the restaurant, a lavish feast with caviar, champagne, and liqueurs, during which joachim had been very quiet, speaking only a few words in almost a whisper, so that the great-aunt, being the benevolent soul she was, told him to cheer up and, suspending the rules of civilized discourse, even addressed him with informal pronouns

senator langhals asked, so you live up there, buddenbrook?
hans castorp avoided them
settembrini now went on to offer herr naphta some information about the cousins, from which it became apparent that he had previously told him about these young men
germans simply have both within them, i replied, otherwise they could not have produced it in those two

yes, it’s over ten years now since i accepted grünlich
he walked hastily to the piano
is he seriously ill, then?
everything was intertwined and at cross-purposes, a great general confusion—and hans castorp thought he saw that the disputants would have been less embittered, if during their dispute each had not been the harasser of his own soul
the path around the sphere, which had been the subject of tortuously clever conversation at kridwiss's, that path, by which regress and progress, the old and the new, past and future become one-i saw it realized here in a return that was rich in novelty and moved well beyond the already harmonic art of bach and handel, back into the deeper past of genuine polyphony
it is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of strangers -how often during those days of collapse and capitulation did i think and suffer through the bitter truth of that statement; for as a german man-despite the universalist hue that catholic tradition casts over my relation to the world-

yes, it could storm, even in this high, peaceful valley
the total cost, he whispered, including the spinal anesthetic, would come to one thousand francs, since almost the entire rib cage was involved, six to eight ribs, and the question now was whether it could be seen as a promising investment
it was a thoroughly surprising poem that he offered in ventriloquist fashion, while those sitting around recited it aloud in admiration, a magical bit of reality, as limitless as the sea, which was its central theme
it was a mere digression, an instructive example to sensitize them to the basics of life, an impromptu fantasy, which he then dropped to turn his official and emphatic emotional engagement back to the immediate demands of the late hour’s festive abandon
but have you any idea of the pain here in my left side?
he was standing with his partner, herr strunck, and made no effort to greet the consul
what they cared about was convincing hans castorp to renounce his abstinence

a drop of whatever it was-paraffin, or some volatile oil, i do not recall specifically, though i believe it was chloroform-a drop, i say, is not an animal, not even a primitive one, not even an amoeba; one does not assume that it has an appetite, seeks nourishment, knows to retain what is digestible and refuse what is not

and as if these changes were not enough, mamselle jungmann, ida jungmann, who had served the buddenbrook family for forty years, left now to return to her west prussian homeland and spend the evening of her life with her relatives there
their juices had such a repulsive odor and taste that if a predator erred and mistakenly attacked in hopes of a fine meal, it immediately spat the morsel out again with every sign of nausea
ida jungmann winced and visibly blanched at that

young as he was, he had held the hand of many a stalwart citizen who had consumed his last joint of meat, his last turkey and dressing, and then—whether death came suddenly and unexpectedly in his office chair or after he had suffered a while in his own solid bed—had commended his soul into god’s hands
your sympathies are with the nobility—and do you want me to tell you why?
perhaps one could find humor in the devouring drop; but that was certainly not how i felt when it came to certain incredible and eerie natural products that adrian's father managed to breed from some bizarre culture, and which he likewise permitted us to observe
the nation's larger theaters were not interested in her; she was unsuccessful or had no real success, for the simple reasonhowever hard it may be for the person involved to grasp it-that her natural talent did not match her ambition

he had been holding a piece of cake between his fingers as he spoke, but now he laid it back on his plate, unwilling to take a bite after such questions

fräulein meyer–de la grange, however, raised her pretty eyebrows and asked, the son of consul buddenbrook?
no, no, as chastisement for such ungodly desires he quoted more long passages from holy scripture, prayed for his parents, his wife, his children, and himself, prayed as well for his brother, gotthold—and finally, after one last bible verse and a final threefold amen, he dusted the page with gold-sand and leaned back with a sigh of relief

a highly fertile hypothesis, the director rejoined
that, too, was a discharge of transcendent dynamic power, caused by negligence-the negligence, namely, of david, the king who played his harp far too much and who, in fact, had likewise no longer had any understanding of things and had ordered the ark be conveyed philistine-fashion, by cart, instead of having it borne on long poles
but the moment herr settembrini introduced the word justice into the conversation, recommending that high principle as the means by which to prevent catastrophes, both domestic and foreign, naphta—who only a moment before had declared the spiritual as too good ever to find earthly expression worthy of it—endeavored to cast doubt on the very notion of the spiritual and to revile it
and they let me get up again only when it became clear that my temperature wasn’t going away with bed rest
someone hearing about it later imagines how ghastly it must have been, but forgets that illness—and my present situation is more or less an illness—batters its victim until they get along with one another

this came as a total surprise to adrian; kretzschmar was enjoying the fun of leaving adrian in the dark, who still suspected nothing even while underway with his teacher from basel to the try-out in geneva
on a sunday morning, around nine o’clock, the consul was sitting near the window of the breakfast room at the large brown secretary, whose rounded top he had rolled back by tripping a tiny mechanism

dr krokowski said, arriving from the russian barbarians’ balcony and stepping up to the head of hans castorp’s lounge chair; and as on every other day, the patient lying there with his hands folded across his chest smiled up in amiable vexation at the ghastly word comrade and gazed at the doctor’s yellow teeth revealed beneath his black beard
you find it difficult to imagine strangers living here; but it will be better if you don’t have to watch

hans castorp, at least, was inclined to believe it was so

it was quite certain that upon hearing of a catastrophe in her son's life she would hasten to join him, and if some calming was to be expected, it seemed only humane to spare her the shocking, indeed unbearable sight of her child's condition, as yet unimproved by institutional care
such a velocity of life was some consolation for joachim in light of the five months that still awaited him—if five would in fact be the end of it

''i am not turning things around, i am stating them as they are!
theology declares the soul is from god, that is philosophically correct, for as the principle that forms each individual manifestation it is a part of the pure form of being-in-general, arising out of the thought that eternally thinks itself, which we call 'god
his smile probably likewise expressed teasing amusement at a certain resistance to his narrative on my part, which must have been noticeable, for he was well aware of my lack of interest, bordering on distaste, for the pranks and mysteries of natural phenomena, for  nature in general, and of my devotion to the sphere of humane letters
she laughed, but then made a more serious face
everyone wanted to revise the constitution and amend the qualifications for voting—and the old citizens were wrangling

though in some sense extravagant, nonetheless has a noble, harmonious, and humanely healthy character and ring, and someone such as myself-to the extent that he makes no claim that his own person has any share in that exalted region or has ever been graced with divinis influxibus ex alto-should see no reasonable argument for shying from it, no point in not speaking of it and dealing with it, while casting a cordial upward glance of reverent familiarity
was it sentimentality for music-which stood for all art-to demand, with growing awareness, that it step out of its worthy isolation and find a sense of the communal without becoming common, to speak a language that a man untutored in music could also understand, as he had once understood the wolf's glen scene, the bridal wreath scene, wagner?

hans castorp flinched as the door opened at his back
he watched closely as they took their leave of colonel herr von rinnlingen, the local commander, who assured the senator that he was very honored by such a visit and that it was much appreciated, and took note of the way his father amiably but somewhat apprehensively laid an arm around the colonel’s shoulder for a moment; at another home a similar remark was received with a calm, serious look, and at a third with an ironically exaggerated returned compliment

what hans castorp found amazing, however, was that joachim would refer at all to dr krokowski’s botany, for they spoke as little of the psychoanalyst as they did of clavdia chauchat or marusya—they never alluded to him, passing over his ways and works in silence
five million subscribers, the memorandum continued, would therefore in the course of twenty years recycle newspaper worth the immense sum of three hundred million marks, two-thirds of which would be applied to renewing subscriptions, making them much cheaper, and one-third, around one hundred million marks, made available for humanitarian purposes—to finance tuberculosis sanatoriums for the general public, to subsidize struggling artists, and so forth

at this point another group of guests left the room: little helmut institoris, who, pale and with his lower lip drawn tightly against his teeth, got up in silent protest; plus his friends, nottebohm the smooth portraitist and his wife, a buxom woman of marked bourgeois manners whom we used to call the maternal breast
he had not failed to include a mole just where the breasts began, and between their soft swellings there was a hint of pale bluish veins

orders were given at the inn to have the carriage ready in an hour, since they would want to rest for an hour or so before sitting down to dinner in town; and then they slowly strolled in the hot, dusty sunshine toward the low roofs of the village
the stork, definitely a very strong, muscular stork, had brought all sorts of marvelous things besides their new sister: for thomas, a new sealskin school bag; for antonie, a large doll with real—how extraordinary!—real hair; a colorful picture book for well-behaved klothilde, who in her quiet, grateful way was occupied almost exclusively with a bag of sweets that the stork had also brought; and for christian, an entire puppet theater, complete with sultan, death, and the devil
our conversation took place on the community bench atop mount zion, its maple trees shading us from the afternoon autumn sun
then hanno would laugh, too, in quiet, deep amusement; for, without even looking at one another or saying a word as they sat there high above it all, they were united in the opinion that his sermons were rather foolish babble and that the real worship service was something that the pastor and his congregation probably thought of as a mere adjunct for elevating the mood of devotion—and that something was music
they were spoken of disparagingly and considered inferior by local standards, not only by those of higher or highest rank, but also by those who themselves were only mildly ill—which allowed them to shrug off their own cases; while at the same time, by subjecting themselves to such standards, they were able to preserve and enhance their own self-esteem

which brought him back to the topic of his growing family and his small house
flirtatious nature like schwerdtfeger's, familiarity's triumph over loneliness had from the start, whether consciously or not, had that special meaning and coloring-which is not to say that it lacked other nobler motives as well
country's condition was still good, fortified by hope, and i was still in the field) and was executed with all the proper bourgeois trimmings: a civil and a church ceremony, a wedding dinner at the hotel vier jahreszeiten, and the subsequent departure of the young couple for a trip to dresden and saxon switzerland-the culmination of a long mutual testing, which had evidently led to the conclusion that they were surely suited to one another
he goes to hamburg, sits down next to christian’s bed, and wins him over
who have swum in close just for a lark
how singularly the years in which i write now close ranks with those that frame this biography!
he could feel detachment and security—and the blind intoxication of self-production that made success possible—only if he was half blinded by light in his eyes, which turned other people, his audience, into no more than a shadowy mass in front of him, to whom he could then present himself as a genial, sociable man, an energetic man of business, the dignified head of his firm, the public speaker
and hans castorp sat down beside him, hiding his sympathetic surprise—if indeed genuine admiration was not the emotion his sense of justice demanded of him—behind amiable, bright chatter, which peeperkorn seconded with magnificent scraps of conversation and very compelling gestures
the thunderstorm cleared, and frau chauchat intervened as well, calling her traveling companion’s attention to the general decline in conviviality

my good engineer, my good engineer, the italian said, bending his head forward thoughtfully and letting his black eyes set
he took a kind of embarrassed delight in telling about the first time he had approached the town hall in dress uniform and had waited until he was well past before saluting to release the sentry from stiff attention
faces quickly took on higher and higher color from the truly marvelous wine—with the exception of dr ting-fu’s
after initial tokens of concealment and defensiveness, adrian very soon offered his childhood friend access to his accomplishments and endeavors, so that with each visit to pfeiffering (and of course i came by as often as i could, almost every saturday and sunday) i was allowed to partake of new sections of the work being born-drafts that grew at times to incredible size from one visit to the next, so that, especially when one took into account a compositional style subject to the strictest laws of intellectual and technical complexity, a person accustomed to a work's progressing at a stolid, proper bourgeois pace might readily turn pale with horror
but nevertheless, one would like to keep in touch, hear something of one another, by mail i mean
music always does prior penance for its sensual realization
we’re all weak human beings with sinful hearts, and if they want to look down on me as a miserable worldly woman, why, i’ll just laugh in their faces
dressing gowns suddenly appeared—two dressing gowns, one for her and one for erika, made of soft, knitted fabric, with broad trains and a band of close-set velvet bows, from neck to hem!
he left halle a day earlier than i, and we had spent his final evening at the theater-just the two of us, without anyone from winfried along; he would be leaving the next morning, and we parted there on the street as we had hundreds of times before-we simply went in different directions

he: who says so?
a citizen’s first duty is to stay calm, and impatience never helps anything

there was something objectively natural and agreeable in the way, for instance, that her dark brown hair, heavy at the nape, was left free at the ears and drawn back from the brow and delicate temples-and that was true of her hands as well, sensibly beautiful hands, not dainty at all, but slender and small-boned, the wrists encircled by the simple cuffs of a white silk blouse
but now that joachim had fallen silent, with the muscles in his face working so hard, and begun behaving as he just had, hans castorp took fright, because he understood that the officer was man enough to act—turned pale with fright, for both of them, for both joachim and himself
a nice, funny young man—ha ha ha, ha ha ha—and what had happened?
there can be no doubt about that
but what a shame, really, that you don’t want to stay through the winter with us—want to spend a mere eight weeks, i’ve heard, correct?
and the consul puts a hand on his shoulder and gives him a thaler
what sums he had not already spent of his mother’s inheritance—half the interest from which had always found its way to hamburg—were now administered by herr stephan kistenmaker, who had been appointed to that office by his deceased friend’s will
their situation in the confines of the two-ton hollow ball was anything but comfortable, their compensation being the knowledge that their shelter was absolutely dependable: built perfectly watertight, it was equal to the enormous pressures and came equipped with an ample supply of oxygen, a telephone, high-powered searchlights, and quartz windows for viewing on every side

confessional history; the middle years are devoted to systematics, which is to say, philosophy of religion, dogmatics, ethics, and apologetics; toward the end come the practical disciplines, meaning liturgics, homiletics, catechetics, the care of souls, the study of church order and law
when she told one of her students, doon’t bee seelly, chawld!, while rapping the table with the knuckle of her index finger—that left an impression, no doubt of it
now and then, when i have time, just in passing, as it were, and not that i neglect my own rest-cure duties, i look in on the serious and critical cases—you know, the ones who come here not for their own amusement and a loose life, but to die

but hans castorp’s posture had stiffened as well now
once they had all solemnly gathered in the landscape room, while the servants and all sorts of poor and old people had crowded into the entrance hall downstairs to have their blue and ruddy hands shaken by the consul, the choirboys of st mary’s would strike up a carol in four-part harmony—it was so festive that it simply made her heart pound
his mother echoed, freezing in place
your informative letter has just reached me, and i hasten to thank you most warmly for the consideration you have shown in asking my consent in the matter at hand; it goes without saying that i am not only happy to give it, but wish also to add my heartiest congratulations, being fully confident as i am that both you and clara have made an excellent choice

she paged back to the end of the large notebook, where on a coarse folio page the whole genealogy of the buddenbrooks was recapitulated in the consul’s hand—with parentheses, rubrics, and clearly recorded dates: from the marriage of their earliest ancestor to brigitta schuren, a pastor’s daughter, to the wedding of consul johann buddenbrook and elisabeth kröger in
but retreat, decline, the beginning of the end
far better, really, if that will were to drift free in a night without time or space, than to languish in a prison cell lit only by the flickering, uncertain flame of the intellect
after he had eaten and drunk his milk or malted beer up in the room, and his mother had left to join the other guests for supper out on the hotel’s glassed-in veranda, he slipped between those old, thin sheets and, to the soft, strong pumping of his contented heart and the muted rhythms of the evening concert, sank into sleep, without fear or fever
when he paused briefly at this point, hans castorp of course asked in feigned amazement, warn us about what?
herr grünlich sat at the edge of the sofa—back straight, hat on knee, ulster still buttoned tight

i find it terribly catholic—erasing god
a few days passed, and young hans castorp had now spent seven months up here, whereas joachim, who already had five months to his credit when his cousin first arrived, could now look back on twelve months, one round year—round in the cosmic sense, as well, for in the time since the small, sturdy locomotive had dropped him off up here, the earth had returned to its starting point, having completed one orbit around the sun
i can still picture some of them: the figure of thomas the stableboy, for example, the same fellow who would meet us at the station in weissenfels and drive us back as well-a one-eyed man, and though exceptionally bony and tall; afflicted with a humpback that sat very high, on which he would frequently let little adrian ride; it had been, so the meister often later assured me, a very practical and comfortable seat

it would start up again with amazing regularity at almost every meal—it was impossible to stop and hard to hide
he was a bony man, a good three heads taller than dr krokowski, with a shock of white hair; his neck vertebrae stuck out, and his watery, bloodshot blue eyes protruded; he had a snub nose above a little short-cropped moustache, which sat slightly askew because his upper lip was turned up at one corner
i saw the skeleton of my own hand, hans castorp said, trying to recall the emotions that had stirred in him at the sight of it
herr albin, you’re young, you’ll get well again, you’ll enjoy life again in a circle of friends who love you, i swear you will!
hans castorp telegraphed back
countless familiar faces gazed up from the rows, and when i stood up i found many people i had to greet: the schlaginhaufens and the habitues of their receptions, the radbruchs along with schildknapp, jeannette scheurl, mmes

with a cunning that was actually foreign to him, he pretended that fräulein engelhart’s enthusiasm for frau chauchat was not in reality what he very well knew it to be, but that her enthusiasm was some neutral, droll fact that he, hans castorp, as an uninvolved party standing off at a cool, amused distance, could use to tease the old maid
and commensurably deep, venerably deep, is likewise his descent at intervals-not only into emptiness and waste and rich sorrow, but also into pain and nauseas-companions, by the by, who were always there, who are part of the propensity, yet now most worthily enhanced by illumination and sensible pot-valiance
and at the sight, hans castorp’s whole heart opened wide—painfully, lovingly wide
excuse me, hans castorp said, to the devil?
his brain, which worked calmly and slowly—particularly since hans castorp retained the habit of drinking porter with his morning snack—gradually filled up with analytical geometry, differential equations, mechanics, projective geometry, and graphical statics
he needed his winter overcoat and both camel-hair blankets for his rest cure, and not just of an evening, but during the day, too
he also tended to believe in the infinite duration of the state and mood in which he happened to find himself at a given moment, cherished it for just that reason and was not eager for change

i don’t rightly know if i should consider myself flattered by the term, but it does sound pretty, i must say
everyone felt the touch of an icy finger deep inside, even hans castorp, who was late in finding his way to his splendid lounge chair that evening; he stretched out and recalled how, as he watched elly’s unseemly achievements and listened to her embarrassed explanation, the ground had shifted under his feet, making him feel a little queasy and anxious all over, like a slight touch of seasickness

elisabeth was determined never to be a white-haired lady

we stopped, and guided by a steward we toured the suite of small, overladen, ostentatious chambers that form this fantasy castle's living quarters, where the melancholic man spent his days, filling them with nothing but the idea of his own majesty, letting von bulow play the piano for him, and listening to kainz's enchanting voice

the rock wall directly behind the hut was steep and dotted with scattered groups of trees, but it could be circumvented by following what looked like a moderate climb on the right, from where you would then be able to see what lay beyond; and hans castorp set out to research the matter, leaving the open field with the hut behind him and skiing down into a rather deep ravine that dropped off from right to left
—he is silent for a moment; but then, suddenly, he turns red, throws his six spoons back in the chest, and shouts, but who has told you that i have any other intention than to have a little look at these things?
not just sauces in general, but sauces specifically for fish—that’s what’s so monstrous about it
relaxation of the rules unifying this organic multiplicity into a single higher self was permitted in some cases, and then a multitude of subordinate individuals would be collected in a loose, muddled way to form a higher living unit

i can assure you that mankind is about to find its way back to this point of view, to recognize that the task of true science is not the pursuit of worthless information, but rather the elimination on principle of what is pernicious, even of what is merely without significance as an idea, and, in a word, to proclaim instinct, moderation, choice

he was also a good fellow and an artist, and i prefer to regard the fact that later on he and adrian did indeed address one another with familiar pronouns and first names not as some cheap triumph of schwerdtfeger's coquetry, but rather as the result of his honest recognition of the value of this extraordinary man, of a genuine fondness for him, from which he drew the amazing imperturbability that finally won the victory over the coldness of melancholy-a calamitous victory, by
at the foot of the stairs to the third floor, the corridor made a little dogleg, passing then along the length of the grand hall to the servants’ stairs, next to which was a side door leading back into the grand hall
here for two years and still capable of such inspiration!
inspired by some casual remark, the debate turned to more concrete subjects, moving quickly with the growing interest and participation of all through a series of issues: corporal punishment, cremation, torture, and the death penalty
i would be surprised, would be astonished, if wendish-slavic-sarmatian blood was not at work there, and if it was not this massive phenomenon of a man—and who would deny him that—who proved to be a fatal weight placed on one of the two precariously balanced scales of your nation, on the eastern scale, which caused—and still causes—the western scale to fly heavenward
there’s another letter enclosed, addressed to mother, which says the same thing
there had been something so strikingly immediate about her reply that they almost believed they had heard the voice of the late consul calling her

you’ve grown so big and you look so strong and healthy, and we should thank god for that
i myself was profoundly touched to hear him recite this last verse, although i do not believe he was aware of my presence
it was not just this lack of a sense of reserve or formal manners, however, that she found alien and disagreeable; although she did not taste deeply of the life and temper of munich, she was surrounded by the atmosphere of a large city full of artists and people who seemed to have nothing to do, and her own mood often made it difficult for her to breathe in such slightly decadent air, to bear all this with good humor
after a period of silence, during which he let this gesture take effect, he added, you did a proper bit of courting there at the end—got in just under the wire, didn’t you?
adding more than a few animated gestures, i left it to riidiger whether to consider my words part of the bellicose journalism that so annoyed him; but in my opinion one had to acknowledge as natural a certain psychological sympathy for a state of mind-itself not without some touching traits-that this one historical moment had shaped from an otherwise multiform german character, even if in the final analysis we were dealing simply with the psychology of a new breakthrough
as a mature woman who had learned something about life and was no longer a silly goose, she found herself incapable of believing in their spotless sanctity

he had business in switzerland and had decided to use the occasion to visit hans on his mountaintop
it was simply as if we had said our goodbyes only the evening before
you don’t mean that and you know perfectly well that it would be a shame, a dreadful shame, to let the hundredth anniversary of the firm of johann buddenbrook pass without a peep
i shall make do with the water tumbler
i suppose you mean it to be repulsive, too; you quite deliberately attempt to make yourself disgusting, forever cringing and writhing
you speak of your brother and sisters as harshly as you speak to me
they gloss over it
and although there were a good twenty people standing or sitting about the room, the silence was deeper than in a church, and the mood—as the senator very carefully whispered to his uncle justus—was just a little reminiscent of a funeral
they are trouble enough, and as a religious man one has to ask oneself whether the world is truly the sole work of a benevolent god or if it is not perhaps a cooperative venture-i wo not say with whom
and in any case, one can surely see a danger to culture if the mind closes one eye to what is vulgarly sensual, or even winks at it
and if i were to summarize my impression, it is as if one were lured from a solid and familiar point of departure into ever more remote regions-everything turns out differently from what one expected
reddish hair, and a tag of a moustache beneath his nostrils-a style popular in those days among the upper classes, and which would later become a hallmark of a face in world history
and if we did not previously mention that this was how the long hours had passed so effortlessly for him, it was because we sympathize with the qualms of conscience that accompanied the terrifying bliss of these visions and images
in order to get his bearings, he stomped his way around the hut and determined that he had arrived at the back end of it after a good hour—or so he estimated—of pure, futile folly
you have to pump with your feet the whole time, sometimes harder and sometimes not so hard
unfortunately, i said, your filia hospitalis cannot read it to you '
in his depressed mood, his inner energies had quietly recovered some strength, too, and his mind was illumined with the clear certainty that the moment had come to break the spell that had been cast over him
he wanted to know about erika and even about grünlich
shame on you, tom
consul buddenbrook’s better at such negotiations than many a lawyer
but there is not a note in these searing, susurrant tones of the spheres and angels that did not appear with strictest correspondence in the laughter of hell
and what a speech!

but why does he always rattle on in that overenergetic, peppy sort of way?
all you have to do is show your spunk and not let them get the upper hand
the music ceased; pastor pringsheim spoke
and that work, in turn, was bound up with the third of these exceptions: a trip to basel in the company of his teacher, kretzschmar, to attend performances of baroque sacred music, which were to be presented in st martin's church by the chamber chorus of basel and for which kretzschmar was to be the organist
there’s still time to ask him to leave the room for a moment
one must despise it insofar as it is the principle of gravity and inertia opposing the flow toward the light, insofar-as it represents the principle of disease and death, insofar as its quintessence is a matter of perversity, of corruption, of lust and disgrace
but this meeting had a powerful effect as it was happening—and afterward, too, because only when it was all over did he see quite clearly how it had been
now that he had such a new, vivid understanding of why joachim had blushed, the whole world seemed new, and that sense of extravagant joy and hope stirred again deep within him
from some corner of the room came the incessant voice of herr stuht from glockengiesser strasse, a black coat pulled on over his woolen shirt, who was deeply involved in the discussion and kept repeating with great indignation, outrageous infamy!
home-to the past, to the headmistress of her boarding school, to former girl friends-and penned poetry in secret
during our st,dent years, the question of freedom was not, or appeared not to be, a burning issue, and so dr schleppfuss could give the word the meaning suitable to it in his class and leave other meanings aside
my eagerness to say everything at once allows my sentences to rise like a flood, propelling them away from the thought they intend to set down, until riding waves of words they seem to lose sight of it
in addition to the shiny little revolver with which he loved to frighten the ladies, he also owned a pair of officer’s pistols, twins bedded together in a velvet-lined case; they were belgian-made automatic brownings, with brown wooden butts that held the magazines, with bluish steel mechanisms and shiny, rifled barrels, their spare, dainty sights set atop the muzzles
and so behrens simply dressed him down: would you please not make such a fuss,  he said, and the patient quieted down at once and died quite peaceably
it came at two this afternoon, and i would have given it to father long before now, but how can i spoil the mood for him today?
the door was answered by a half-grown lad with close-trimmed hair and red cheeks; he was dressed in a kind of uniform—a striped footman’s jacket and gaiters
time, they say, is water from the river lethe, but alien air is a similar drink; and if its effects are less profound, it works all the more quickly
that’s precisely it, hans castorp said
dr heidekind scolded whenever he saw him and insisted on a change of air, and he meant a radical change
hydrostatics, he wouldn’t understand, wouldn’t have the vaguest, wouldn’t even be interested

i kept my peace when you chose to make a payment of , marks courant so that i might set up my own business at the time of my marriage and also promised a single payment of another , as my share of the inheritance
to think that someone like you, who uses such grand words for such shameless purposes, can accuse me of demagoguery
look there—one of your ivan ivanovitches, without cuff or collar, has got into a fight with prosecutor paravant
unprepossessing in appearance, a squat man with a round skull, short-clipped moustache, and brown eyes whose gaze was now musing, now frisky, but always given to smiling, he could truly have benefited the intellectual and cultural life of kaisersaschern-had there been, that is, any life of that sort
we told it for its own sake, not yours, for you were a simple fellow

grandfather settembrini had struggled for political rights—but his own grandfather, or at least his ancestors, had originally possessed all those rights, which over the course of four centuries the rabble had wrested from them by force and slogans
a brief walk up to the water trough or to the english quarter, a little rest in his lounge chair
the town was palestrina, the birthplace of the composer-called praeneste by the ancients and mentioned by dante in canto xxv i i of the inferno as pcnestrino, the stronghold of the princes of colonnaa picturesque settlement propped against its mountain and accessible from the church below only by a street of low steps that was not very tidy and lay under the shadow of houses
he had seen the cousins coming, he said, from his little window and had quickly finished off the encyclopedic page he had been working on, so that he, too, could join the party

and josephus screamed next, please
the week after next, we’re expecting pastor mathias from cannstatt
almost nothing was said during the ride home
when, in fact, there was nothing to that fawning poet laureate and flunky of the julians, that oh-so-urbane inkslinger and rhetorical show-off without a spark of creativity, whose soul, if he had one, was secondhand at best, who was not a poet at all, but a frenchman togged out in a full augustan wig of flowing curls
non, j'en suis sur!
he now had to sit back up from being bent over with laughter; and from his face one could read that this was not easy for him, that he felt compromised
for in this he was true to type: that he dearly and truly loved living well, and despite his thin-blooded, refined appearance, he clung to the cruder pleasures of life as a gluttonous baby clings to its mother’s breast
yes, sir, morten replied, trying to give his face a stern, determined look
his heirs had drawn their money out of the business, and the consul strongly advised christian not to continue with only his own funds, because he knew quite well how difficult it was to keep a large-scale business going once its capital was suddenly reduced
knifelike pains of the  little mermaid; in conversation he also applied to it another, remarkably precise and vivid image that i recalled a few months later, in the spring of r  , when the burden of illness was removed from him as if by a miracle and his mind soared phoenix-like to the most sublime freedom and astounding power in a period of unrestrained, if not to say, uninhibited, or at least unstoppable and onrushing, almost breathless productivity-and it was that very image that revealed to me how those two states, of depression and of elation, were not sharply set off from one another, did not break apart without any connection, but rather that the latter had been preparing itself in the former and to some extent was already contained within it-just as, vice versa, the period of health and creativity was anything but a time of ease, but likewise in its own way a time of obsession, of painful urgency and distress
change the ending, child, and then it will be a tidy piece of work
oh, no, hans castorp said with a laugh
yes, sometimes i’ve had the fleeting impression that i would actually have been in my element there
well, i’ve had enough for today, the senator said and thought about getting up, but then stayed seated all the same and laid his head back
and by such means, to be sure, pallid liberal theology can take on deeper and stronger, yes, more glowing colors; it can be truer to the aesthetically antiquated ideas one instinctively associates with the word theology
at the mention of the word knife, mynheer peeperkorn had changed his sitting position in bed somewhat, suddenly edging away and turning his face to search his guest’s eyes
and tony took her place at the table
and he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy
we exchanged some introductory correspondence; i went to see him, and was ushered by his butler into his study, where i found him seated at his desk
yes, terror and fear were bound up with them; hope, joy, and nameless dread could spill over into boundless uncertainty and total extravagance, but at times they could also suddenly press in on his young heart—that is, his heart in the genuine, physical sense—so that he would put one hand to that organ and the other to his brow, as if to shade his eyes, and whisper, my god!
one might say you’ve ended your novitiate and have taken your vows
he appeared to be prouder of this clever feat, a veritable tour de force, than of the actual musical inventions from which the work lived-and that restriction of their uninhibited blossoming left me a little concerned
hug it, he said
you should have gone back to your work long before this, sur le chantier, or wherever it was
he was afflicted by a game known as elevens, in which a bridge deck is arranged in three rows of three cards each, and any two cards that add up to eleven, plus any of the three face cards when they turn up, are then covered anew, until, if fortune smiles, the game is won
if only there had not been that quiver in his voice when he spoke of art's need of redemption, of its being on a firstname basis with humanity-it was an agitation that tempted me, despite everything, to press his hand clandestinely
no, it isn’t, is it?
dear old joachim’s heart and words were brimming over with it; he spoke about himself, never mentioning his cousin’s future
the others began to take their seats, hallooing, chatting, and clapping shoulders, and hans castorp, feeling put off by the tone of these opening remarks, was likewise moving to find a spot in the semicircle of chairs, when the doctor turned to address him personally
placet experiri, he said, pronouncing the c of placet with the soft italian ch
but just in case, he had given much thought to the section of the legal code that permitted divorce should a husband prove incapable of supporting his wife and children
echo was truly pleased by these gifts, but nevertheless quickly said 'nuff, once he had played with them, and much preferred his uncle to show him the grown-up objects he used himself and explain their function-always the same items, over and over, for children's persistence and appetite for repetition are great in matters of amusement
the consul had withdrawn a little to one side against the wall, where the chairs were; since his father was standing he did not sit down, but instead nervously grasped one of the chairs’ high arms, and watched the old man read, scowling, his head bent to one side, his lips moving rapidly
what people have fought for, have stormed citadels for, and what people filled to overflowing have announced with jubilation-it ought not be
but every year fräulein weichbrodt went about her last christmas party with such jittery devotion to the task that the evening never passed without some surprise, some mishap, some little catastrophe that made all her guests laugh, but only increased their hostess’s mute fervor
they said nothing for a long time
mamselle jungmann and the kitchen maid had opened the white folding doors to the dining room, and the party moved at a confident, leisurely pace in its direction—one could reckon with a nourishing snack at the buddenbrooks’
his flight from the festivities each evening seemed honorable enough, but the effect was anything but calming; and then, too, there were certain moments when it seemed as if joachim’s good example at doing one’s rest-cure duty—and even his expert introduction to its procedures—had a dubious side as well
i bid my guide as a final service that he show me to an inn for my meal
they were all vaguely aware of this, and although they were not dealing here with a serious and authentic return to life, but a purely sentimental and theatrical performance, during which one would only see the departed person—nothing life-threatening, really—they nevertheless feared being confronted by whomever they had thought about, and each would have preferred to pass on to his neighbor the privilege of expressing such a wish
the human body consists of water for the most part
it concerned merit, that much i do recall-achievement realized by battle and struggle, by willpower and self-mastery; and rudolf, who had just praised such occurrences with all his heart, calling them meritorious, could not understand where institoris could possibly get the notion to contradict him and refuse to recognize merit in anything that required sweat
there was really something kindhearted and forgiving in the way it did it
and then there’s krokowski, his assistant—a very savvy character
to that eloquent orator and humanist, whom she could not stand and called arrogant and inhumane?
but now what happened?
an organism—a blind, rash, pitiful eruption of the insistent assertion of the will
perhaps you would enjoy collapsing dead in front of the closed school gates
people endeavored to close that abyss with theories—it swallowed them whole, and was still not an inch less broad or deep
have the asses of virtue taken to butting us now?
but when they departed, their faces and eyes were clearer, milder, and more blissfully enigmatic than before; and inside the room elisabeth lay quite still, with their look in her eyes, their expression on her face
of that there can no longer be any doubt, and it is regrettable that no one representing psychiatric science is part of our circle
something must have happened
she put out her lovely hand to greet her husband, a gold bracelet tinkling at the wrist, and as was her habit she turned the palm upward as far as possible, which seemed to heighten the warmth of her gesture
rudolf died-which as the doctor told me immediately after his examination was likely to happen-on the way to the municipal hospital
what do you mean, uncle niko?
meanwhile italians were playing barrel organs outside in the snow-covered streets, and from far off you could hear the hubbub from the christmas market in the town square

maria’s the worst of the lot, you see, maria’s simply depraved
but don’t do anything to demean yourself, anna, do you hear?
yes, yes, that’s her way of adding insult to injury
but otherwise, along with stars of the theater, one saw various politicians of the catholic people's party, even a noted social democratic parliamentarian, and a few high and not so high functionaries of the new state, among whom there were still people of good family, lik� herr von stengel, a fundamentally jovial man who would try anything once-but also certain elements who were energetically ill-disposed toward the liberalistic republic and on whose brow was boldly written their intent to avenge germany's disgrace and their awareness of representing a coming world
that look on his face, as if he had something foul-tasting in his mouth, had become more and more pronounced; then he had been confined to his bed, and then he died—no one knew exactly when; the matter was handled with customary tact and discretion
death is a great power
i am disturbing you by breaking into your family circle like this, he said in a soft voice, both refined and reserved
the explanations she offered little johann for this behavior could only lead him to believe that all his contemporaries either were scrofulous or had what she called evil humors—and that he was the lone exception
we have our work cut out for us, marcus
but the people in the berghof dining hall were certainly not so flippant and unsteady as all that
but within a very short time, herr popóv was seen sitting serenely beside his equally serene young wife at the good russian table, and he finished his midday meal as if nothing had happened

herr stephan kistenmaker, whose own family was growing and who, along with his brother, had been doing very well in the claret business, immediately offered to buy it
thomas, elisabeth buddenbrook said, more gingerly now, to avoid unleashing another coughing fit, please believe me—you only offend people by constantly supporting the catholics rather than assisting the black sisters of the protestants
i can see already that you have made him happy, can i not?
but how can that be?
hans castorp raised his arms and made a face that said that a great many things were written, on both sides of the question, and that it was difficult to decide what was right and abide by it
oh, leave your cousin out of this
i left kaisersaschern and with my wife and child settled by the banks of the lsar, in this venerable town that has been a bishopric for many centuries, where, in easy communication with the capital and so, too, with my friend, i have spent my life (w:th the exception of a few months during the war) and have been a loving, unnerved witness to the tragedy of his
)-baron riedesel, then, saw in whatever was old and historic a bulwark against all things modern and subversive, a kind of feudal polemic against them, and in that spirit he supported the old without in fact understanding anything about it
tony went rigid; she was so stunned that her tears vanished
i am an ugly old woman—that may well be—and babbit is prettier, that much is sure
i beg you, my dear antonie, to ponder these things in your heart

they had, by the way, an heir in their grown son, gereon (not georg) by name, a young man given to new machines and very progressive ideas when it came to farming; also a somewhat younger daughter named clemen tina
but how long that takes can vary greatly—according to how we feel it!
and christian would wrinkle his nose and stare at her as if to say, aren’t you the least bit ashamed of yourself?
yes, and since then the mother just wanders about, when she’s not sitting with them, and the only thing she ever says to anyone she meets is: tous les deux!
perhaps that, that alone, was her illness
his head was buzzing, his eyelids were like lead, his heart beat like a little kettledrum, and to add to his agony, he took a notion that pretty marusya, who was sitting bent forward, her face buried in the hand with the ruby ring, was laughing at him, even though he had taken considerable pains not to give her any reason to do so
the external form of this contamination was a rapid growth of tissue, a tumor, pathologically speaking, which was the cells’ reaction to the stimulus of bacilli having taken up residence among them
only these four were left now from the mardi gras party—they sat there motionless
do you recognize her?
and i do not hesitate, for my part, to admit that at this moment i sincerely regret the step that seemed to me so wise and beneficial four years ago
one layer of the ectoderm thickened, folded to form a groove, then closed to build a nerve canal, became the spinal column, the brain

he had first returned to william blake and had set to music a very strange poem by this author he so loved: silent, silent night, with its four stanzas, each of three lines ending on one rhyme, the last of which reads, curiously enough: but an honest joy
if only i could say it would kill me, but a man can’t live with it or die from it
there was nothing of his semlinger heritage about him, but he did have a yellow complexion and pointed gap-teeth
she wept over herr weinschenk’s top hat, over the way he lifted his eyebrows when he caught sight of her and quickly let them fall again, over his absolutely royal posture and his carefully balanced fists
by the way, i also notice you are coming to the defense of illness yet again
now you’ve been convicted by your own pupil of harboring warlike tendencies
for some reason tony suddenly scowled and replied, without looking at herr grünlich, hoffmann’s serapion brethren
and yet the real point should be to inflame our reason
be that as it may—the charge of cruelty is a rather sentimental charge
but what about the inquiries the consul had made, the books he had examined?
he took a deep breath, letting his hand glide slowly across his brow and eyes, automatically lit another cigarette, although he knew they were not good for him, and went on gazing into the darkness through the smoke
i know, dear tony, i know it all
just look at that !
and joachim, his eyes shifting about and his mouth opening as if to utter a hopeless oh, let his hand trail off in a gesture of immeasurability
and what were these comrades chatting about?
and he fetched a bright green box from the cupboard to offer them one
it foamed up brown in the little onion-pattern cups
what was to become of their second-born remained for the parents an open question that would have to be decided by inclinations and abilities he might demonstrate; and it was remarkable, then, how early the notion became firmly fixed in their and all our minds that adrian would have to be a scholar
true, when you listened to the director talk you might sometimes think he had a temperature—there was something not quite right about the way he spoke, it sounded so brash and jovial and easygoing, but there was also something strange about it, something overwrought, especially when you considered those purplish cheeks and watery eyes, which looked as if he were still weeping for his wife
they did not make the attempt

wehsal, who was brought in for consultation, informed them that naphta had stated he did not want a doctor present
and yet it was not only, not even primarily, the gambling and the wine that brought forth these high-tension emotions around the table and made faces flush and shining eyes grow wider, so that the whole party was engaged in what might be called a common strenuous effort, all holding their breath in almost painful concentration on the moment
in a rather low voice, he said, ladies and gentlemen
as the carriage passed
the neighbors who lived in the solid, gabled houses propped themselves in their windows and watched the men at work on the scaffolds, took great delight in seeing the walls rise, and tried to guess the date for the roof-raising

he challenged you, hans castorp said anxiously
that's funny, very funny, he said
one can never expect you to do any work, he went on with easy eloquence now, and you always have some excuse ready at hand, heinricy
it was almost eight o’clock, but still daylight
why did he have to test the thing out on other women, when he had one that he loved, so much apparently that·
to which hans castorp merely gave a shrug—in perfect imitation of the shrug he had first seen joachim give the evening before
after pointlessly multiplying pi by diameter to find the circumference of innumerable circles, pi by the square of the radius to find their area, the prosecutor increasingly began to wonder if since the days of archimedes humanity had not just been making the whole thing too complicated, if the solution to the problem was not childishly simple
justus kröger, the debonair suitier, the son of the old cavalier à la mode, was not a very happy man
but he still often had difficulty swallowing when eating, and of late this phenomenon had been accompanied by a temporary shortness of breath, an asthmatic condition, which for several weeks christian believed to be consumption, the nature and symptoms of which he painfully attempted—with much wrinkling of his nose—to describe in minute detail for his family
in my opinion it suffices fully if it is heard just once-that is, when the composer conceives it
madame kethelsen had gone to her rest as well
she climbed the stairs heavily—she was expecting, as usual
confidentially, he also had to add, it was somehow awkward, indeed degrading when passion, and a desperate passion at that, was felt by the woman and the man was only fulfilling his cavalier's duty
it seems to me that the whole adagio is still rather unsatisfactory
the discipline and elegance, the hushed serenity and intellectual challenge, the well-ordered and well-tended life, the precise yet richly varied schedule—it all spoke to leo’s profoundest instincts
he was upset, of course, by the polypraxios-nölting affair
the body triumphs, has other plans than the soul, and gets its way—quite a comedown for high-minded types who teach that the body must obey the soul

and if you were to go for a stroll, you’d be quite the fine fellow, much like the citizens of palermo who are hung up in the capuchin catacombs near the porta nuova

raised eyebrows and faces in which one read the question: what is he getting at, what is this all about?
but especially on days when he had not seen echo, of an evening after the child had been put to bed, he liked to step softly, scarcely noticed into the child's room and listen to the boy's prayers, which he said lying on his back, with the palms of his hands pressed together before his chest and with one or both of his nurses, frau schweigestill and her daughter, stand-

a purple country wine, which between brays the lawyer drank in great gulps like water, a vintage too torrid as a suitable beverage for two meals a day, but that it would have been a shame to water, served to quench our thirst

at the time i returned to civilian life, however, he was fiercely devoted to his work-in my view not so much because of its actual object, that is, the gesta music, or not exclusively so at least, but because he was anxious to put it behind h\m and to ready himself for the new demands of genius that were announcing themselves

kröger senior, however, was enthroned high and erect between the wife of senator langhals and madame antoinette, dividing his hand gestures and reserved jests equally between those two ladies

and so there he lay, and once again, as the height of summer came round for the seventh time since his arrival—but he did not count—the year closed on itself
to be sure, a lot depends on the way in which it is spoken about
and for that his teacher's lectures seemed to me a means that i ought not disdain, that indeed was indispensable
even consul fritsche came hurrying down the steps of the pavilion—he hoped that at least next year the buddenbrooks would return to help swell the population of his spa
to reach the almost ladderlike stairway to the top floor, they had to pass lukaček’s door again and noticed the peevish tailor was still sitting on his table, working on the sleeved dress for the old lady
i realize i ought not to have included these trifles and crumbs of observation here
the ease with which you understand me speaks for the naturalness of the matter
his father’s name was there, as was in fact his grandfather’s, and his great-grandfather’s; and now that syllable came doubled, tripled, and quadrupled from the storyteller’s mouth; and the boy would lay his head to one side, his eyes fixed and full of thought, yet somehow dreamily thoughtless, his lips parted in drowsy devotion, and he would listen to the great-great-great-great—that somber sound of the crypt and buried time, which nevertheless both expressed a reverently preserved connection of his own life in the present to things now sunk deep beneath the earth and simultaneously had a curious effect on him: the same effect visible in the look on his face
that it was not
tony did of course spend some time with her friends from town on the beach or in the hotel garden, and she was taken along on sailing parties or invited to this gala or that
these papers, the italian said, swiftly extracting a package from the pouchlike side pocket of his petersham coat—an oversize opened envelope, which contained several flyers and a letter that he ran through his fingers for hans castorp to see—these papers bear a letterhead in the french language: international league for the organization of progress
what is that you’re reading?
and since they could not read the monkey directly from their books with the director present, the recitation was a fiasco; and when they moved on to ivanhoe, only young count mölln could translate a little of it, because he actually had some interest in the novel
he awoke abruptly with a delicious start, like a man awakening alone in his bed with love stirring in his heart
he turned the pages, however, with his little left arm and hand, and unconsciously held in that motion, they hovered there in an unbelievably graceful gesture, the hand with open palm in midair to the left of the book, so that i felt as if i had never seen a child sitting so charmingly (even in dreams my own would never have offered me such a sight!
he had slipped down too far in his bed and curtly demanded to be propped back up again
first he read the advertiser and contentedly finished smoking his morning cigarette
well, one can’t spend one’s whole life being the silly goose i once was
the libretto adapted from shakespeare's comedy love 's labour's lost, leverkiihn's mischievous youthful composition, comes from me; i was also permitted some influence on the preparation of the texts for both the grotesque opera suite gesta romanorum and the oratorio the revelation of st john the divine
evenin’, my boy, said behrens, who had been engaged in a hushed conversation with dr krokowski and the head nurse, and now greeted him with a melancholy nod and a skew of his little white moustache
ah lord, direct and guide us all for as long as we live on this earth…—the pen hurried along, smooth and agile, here and there executing a commercial curlicue while addressing god in line after line
i see it as well in the light of a sacrifice, and you can truly demand that i regard it as such
more respectable and worthy heights
and they’re all very high
yes, he remarked softly after a pause, it’s true
nor is obtuseness necessarily harmless
hans castorp, as we have said, took note of them in his kindhearted way and he opened himself to them as a way of testing them—from which it became particularly clear that the waking hans castorp was a very different person from the fatuously dreaming hans castorp, who had called settembrini an organ-grinder to his face and tried with all his might to push him out of the way because he was bothering him
but it’s true, i wouldn’t mind a chance to freshen up a bit myself
then he looked at his wristwatch—it was :
would he have a single moment alone, a single moment to let the muscles of his face relax?
what should i take with me, papa?
yes, you say that as a military man, and i must admit, the military understands these things
the tables were turned, and no one had noticed
but don’t let it annoy you so—it causes wrinkles
art is moral, in that it awakens
and so they hid behind uncle justus, who sent his wife to see her sister-in-law, who was the wife of oeverdieck the lumber merchant, whose job it was to soften up her aged father-in-law
he stole in here quietly to hear music—do you wish to poison his mind for good and all?
the flower of evil, i repeated with a nod
one evening after a performance, presumably tipsy from wine, this prickly and brittle, but basically inexperienced and defenseless woman succumbed to his practiced routine-to her own great anger and furious self-contempt; for, to be
her cousins said in unison
there are two ways to life: the one is the regular, direct, and good way
i think it likely that from the very first your symptoms should not have been traced exclusively to tuberculosis, and i draw that conclusion from my presumption that they cannot be traced to it at all now
jeannette and schwerdtfeger sometimes played music together, both for the guests of old madame scheurl and privately, and so they had arranged for a joint trip to pfeiffering, with rudolf in charge of telephoning their plans
one might have been tempted to think his frock coat gave off a grisly odor, but that would have been pure prejudice
it was, to put it in the briefest terms, the dichotomy between aesthetics and ethics, which to a great extent governed the cultural dialectics of the era and was more or less personified in these two young people-the contradiction between a scholarly glorification of  life in its glittering thoughtlessness and a pessimistic veneration of suffering, with its depths and its wisdom
under normal circumstances, the tall, distinguished figure of the former cavalier à la mode would have revealed that he was beginning to bend beneath the burden of his eighty years; but today he stood quite erect, his eyes half closed, the corners of his mouth turned down in elegant disdain, the short tips of his white mustache turned straight up
it automatically reminded me of it
hans castorp remembered that he had heard the same sounds the night before, but had been too tired to pay them any attention
toward the end of the meal she would have to excuse herself, and with the assistance of ida jungmann or rieke severin, she would go down to the garden or the back courtyard and suffer the most dreadful fits of nausea
i myself later heard him do it at the roddes' and schlaginhaufens', and he told me how even as a very young boy, before he ever took violin lessons, he had begun to develop the skill, practicing just whistling along to a piece of music no matter where he happened to be, and had later continued to perfect his mastery of the art
he would have liked to remain behind in the landscape room himself, to sit in an armchair and give rein to his dreams and feelings as the tune carried him along
take off your coat, and do sit down, dear papa
and yet, as we have said, hans castorp’s diminished friends and mentors were still at their best when arguing
frau magnus was so far gone that she was sitting on herr albin’s lap, tugging at both his earlobes—to which herr magnus reacted with what appeared to be relief
the frau senator spoke less engagingly about her daughter frau institoris in munich
on the basis of their finding, however, a man who doubtless deviated from the norm, but who for all that certainly was not crazy, was denied the right to dispose of his person, degraded to the status of a psychiatric patient, and locked in a lake-bound castle with windows barred and door handles unscrewed
not much hope, my lad—none at all, actually
hans castorp ordered his facial expression—had, in fact, already done so the moment he spotted the italian
piety, reverence, decency of the soul-these are possible only in terms of man and through man, only when restricted to what is earthly and human
at that moment ida jungmann entered the room, holding little erika by the hand
it was probably the first time that inez had seen her lover since he had severed their relationship-with considerable brutality, i fear, for it was hardly possible to do so in a nice way, given the desperate tenacity with which she clung to him
in a word, it is bourgeois misery organized as a club
taking the key, he nodded menacingly several times directly in the doctor’s face, turned on his heels, and left the room
herr settembrini let silence reign
i most certainly did, herr settembrini
a recitation begins with a bow, son
the preparations he was making were almost concluded
well, i was going to escort fräulein antonie to the temple of the sea
it drew so evenly that it could easily have served as an hourglass for the man enjoying it, and indeed, given hans castorp’s needs, did serve as such, for he no longer carried his pocket watch
of course, young hans castorp could not see his way clear to take such carryings-on very seriously, indeed her mere presence seemed prejudicial to the dignity of this place of suffering
how else, if inez had considered herself quite unobserved, could she have presumed as a matter of course that i was in the know?
i’ll never forget the evening i met her
my cousin and i were speaking about that earlier
the problem of the highly gifted person was how, despite being progressively spoiled, despite an ever-spreading nausea, he could still hold to the doable
ah yes, so he felt serene
it was a little business deal—not exactly proper, but certainly not unusual, either
not baked, but distilled, my angel
take hanno’s nervous sleep, for example, the way he starts up and is so frightened by his dreams
no, she was wrestling now with life to gain death
it lacks some of the details that behrens found there
our hostess valued his dialectical skill with words (spoken, by the way, with a palatinate accent) and his love of paradox, which would leave the ladies clasping their hands above their heads in a kind of prim jubilation
the hills and crags and purest air,
shivers of horror ran down his back
it is as if the meister were using this seemingly anarchic piece to take a deep breath before his faust cantata, his most rigorously formal work
the concepts of death and corruption play an important role, too
this wealthy man's table was set for about fifteen people for dinner at seven; with its well-trained staff, supervised by a housekeeper with affected manners and the hope of marrying one day, his was a hospitable house, and it was usually people from the world of finance and business whose company he kept
and the ladies—lord, lord, the ladies!
hans castorp had indeed adopted the right tone in speaking of them—that of religious submission
i can understand, he said, your not giving me the job of finding some place for you
he was not smiling at all—no more today than on any other occasion
in short, there are winter days and summer days, spring and autumn days, but no real seasons, we don’t actually have those up here
the letter was handed to the porter, who avoided the postal detour of a mailbox, and took it down to meet the next scheduled train
and here his free hand grasped her other hand and he gazed deeply into her eyes, wide with fright
no, nothing obtrusive, no coarse claims on her
you find that stupid, herr settembrini, and certainly it is vague, which in your eyes is worse than stupid
and was it all that much different with me?
and i love erika very much
the lowest animals had no nervous systems, let alone a cerebral cortex, and yet no one dared deny that they were capable of responding to stimuli
do you see these cavities here?
at this point in the year, the weather everywhere else in the world was worse for patients with lung disease
that is classic medievalism, my dear sir
mantic works, is none at all
farewell, hans—whether you live or stay where you are!
i don’t think i’d fit in very well, you see
the piece was clever, tight, tingly, and was reproduced here in all its witty, giddy invention
his uncle sat with him at the table and watched as he ate his snack neatly and daintily
it is indeed a law
everyone was talking about it my first few days here
it makes me shudder
he was not only anti-pharisaical, anti-dogmatic, but also anti-metaphysical, oriented entirely toward ethical and epistemological concerns; a proclaimer of an ideal of personality grounded in morality, he was mightily ill-disposed toward the pietistic separation of world and faith
i know this from adrian himself: she warned him; and does not that imply a gratifying disparity between the creature's higher humanity and that physical part of her, the vile commodity of trade cast to the gutter?
and what acoustic panic flows from the repeated instrumentation for timpani glissandi, a musical or sound effect achieved here by adjusting the pedal mechanism of the timpani to various pitches even as the hands are performing the drum roll
and so no one had left?
afterward, hanno went to the salon and got things ready for their music session; he sat at the piano and waited for his mother
the revenge was automatic, prompt, cold-eyed, mysterious
that’s merely flimsy idealism
in this solemn attitude, in this duty, in this reverence of man for himself, there is god; i cannot find him in hundreds of billions of milky ways
she asked with nervous excitement
joachim cast him a gentle glance and smiled a curious smile—melancholy and slightly mocking, it seemed—but why, he kept to himself
i must consider our discussion at an end
the two of them did best when intellectual breezes blew, when they debated and could capture the attention of the strollers with one of their elegant, passionate, academic arguments (though the tone of voice implied that it was one of the most burning questions of the day, of life itself) the burden of which they more or less carried alone, thereby neutralizing for its duration the presence of the man of stature, who could offer only a brow creased in astonishment and some vague mocking scraps of commentary
beer, tobacco, and music, he said
you have made a stroke!
short order … short order, he said crossly and shook his head as he glanced at his mother
well, and what about you, my young member of the civilian population?
our sacred german soil!
they will have taken it all quite calmly
you and your behrens!
how does nature accomplish it through the animal?
artistic thought, he suggested, formed an intellectual category unique to itself, and yet a first sketch of a painting or a statue hardly ever consisted of words-which was evidence of the special bond between music and language
as far as rye, oats, or barley go?
they would be staying here
that’s the second time now, but of course it was the husband’s fault both times
but her lips were bluish, and the tip of her nose had taken on the same hue, evidently from a lack of oxygen
supporting his arguments with all kinds of examples and anecdotes from the books and loose pages that lay on the table before him, even reciting poetry a few times, dr krokowski discussed love’s frightening forms—bizarre, agonized, eerie mutations of its symptoms and omnipotence
if i am not mistaken, it was on mount zion at home that you once tendered me kindred disclosures
they were all there, except klothilde, who had gone to grudging to nurse her sick father
that i should shun humankind
his head had turned purple again and he was quivering, straining to control himself, until he finally managed to say, well …—and the spell was broken, the battle won
after taking his third step—naphta had already reached the cane barrier, without firing—he raised his pistol high in the air and squeezed the trigger
that is no python with which we shall do astounding feats
oh, that’s nothing, mother, he doesn’t mean anything by that
what do you say to that!
it is simply enormement caracteristique, and that same note is indispensable for the series of concerts of international music that i am arrangmg
just let him come, just let him dare come to see the house
and when herr modersohn entered, try as he might, he was unable to close the door, because a fat pine cone had been stuck in the crack—adolf todtenhaupt had to remove it
i had to sell flowers
for two years, until last fall, a baroness von handschuchsheim had lived here and rambled about the house-a lady whose ideas, as frau schweigestill put it, had refused to match those of the rest of the world, and who had sought refuge here from that mismatch
such suggestions came as a rule not only from jeannette scheurl, but also from the general intendant, his excellency von riedesel, whose patronage of my old instrument and old music sprang, to be sure, not from learned, antiquarian interests as with kranich, but rather from a purely conservative bias
how well it speaks for him, that deeply attentive friendship extended by delacroix, who writes him, ]'espere vous voir ce soir, mais ce moment est capable de me faire devinir fou
but you don’t lay yourself open to such an insolent dressing-down
but then, that form of address had gained general usage during the meal
frau stöhr mentioned that we can get little toy trumpets at the concierge’s desk, is that right?
suddenly, especially if the sisters had declined to dance, he would grow thoughtful and take a seat at the table beside adrian and baptist spengler, who always wore a domino and drank red wine
oh yes, i doubt if he would turn down the offer, the senator said with bitterness
you’d find things there…
this was very much in the spirit of the work, the singer had grasped that spirit with great intelligence
she believed, without knowing it, that absolutely every character trait was a family heirloom, a piece of tradition, and therefore something venerable and worthy of her respect, no matter what
ence, the name kaschperl gradually became a mere memory, and the dog itself finally preferred to answer to suso
after all, i’ve seen you wink at the girls
eva ewers knew how—fine
he had, as noted, given up his commercial ventures; but he attempted to fill the hours of the day when he was not at the club with various activities
but her wardrobe was all bright colors again, she let her hair fall in little curls over her forehead, and she was once again busy with her round of social visits
the rest, however, the curvature that by some ethereal, spiritual means escaped the calculable embrace that could turn it into a rational number—that, said the prosecutor, his jaw trembling, that was pi!
and all the guests declared they could not stand to see any more snow, it disgusted them, summer alone had more than satisfied them in that regard, nothing but masses of snow, day in, day out, mounds of snow, pillows of snow, whole slopes of snow—it was more than any human being could stand, deadly to both mind and spirit
and if we look around for hans castorp in this setting, we will find him in the reading room, the same room where once (though this once is vague, since neither narrator, reader, nor hero is quite clear anymore as to the degree of pastness involved) he had been party to important disclosures concerning the organization of human progress
i’ll paint it a little, he said
he's always too ambitious in the company of ladies
am i right to think you would be grateful for that?
i ask you—a man who weeps?
he has close-trimmed white whiskers and salt-and-pepper hair on top of his head that looks like goose down and flutters in the breeze
no, these two boys had nothing whatever in common with their fellow students, who were content with simple revenge or obstinacy
it was necessary, however, ruthlessly to attack such secondary phenomena
young frelon remarked as they drove ’cross the heath,
he was well aware that she had not agreed to the marriage out of love, but he thought it possible that four years of a life together and the birth of a child might have changed a great many things, that tony might feel bound to her husband now, body and soul, and reject any notion of separation for reasons both christian and worldly
he felt the whole world looking expectantly at him to see if he would know how to further the interests of both the old firm and the family, and not just preserve their prestige
quite a bit of reading went on at the international sanatorium berghof, both in the common lounging areas and on private balconies—this was particularly true of newcomers and short-termers, since residents of many months or even years had long since learned how to ravage time without diverting or employing their minds, had become virtuosi at putting time behind them, and declared openly that only clumsy bunglers in the art needed a book to hang on to
i have no need to throw my money in the nearest ditch to prove the firm’s solvency
once, when adrian had declined the frau senator's invitation, remaining in his room because of a headache and a total aversion to society, schwerdtfeger had suddenly appeared at his door, in a cutaway and black ascot, to persuade him, ostensibly on behalf of several or all the guests, to join their company after all
around his neck, however, lay a wide, starched, heavily pleated ruff, slanted forward, but sloping upward on both sides, beneath which, to top it all, could be seen a pleated batiste jabot and a vest
i already told you that you could be of help to me in this difficult matter
simple snapshots were soon considered déclassé and color photography à la lumière was the thing
i think maybe you’ll come to understand that in due time, after you’ve been up here with us a little longer
russians, male and female, herr settembrini said, and a tightening was visible at the corner of his mouth
well, lnstitoris did not shout, but spoke instead in a low lisping voice, even when proclaiming the italian renaissance as an age reeking of blood and beauty
if only mama had not said anything about getting excited
i can’t be anything
what he felt was no different from what a lad in the flatlands feels when he casts that first glance at a girl and cupid’s barbed arrow unexpectedly pierces his heart
he looked at me, and i believe the color had drained from his face
the rest, sir, will follow in due course
but enough—the towel, please, wenzel, the consul concluded
he obviously said it simply because he wanted to break up the circle, for the very next words from his honeysweet lips were echo does not think it proper to stay out o' doors now
the mere mention thereof!
several young women emerged out of the group, ready for a swim with tony
it was warmth, the warmth produced by instability attempting to preserve form, a fever of matter that accompanies the ceaseless dissolution and renewal of protein molecules, themselves transient in their complex and intricate construction
sometimes little yellow worms wriggled from out their nostrils, crawled down their breasts, and vanished-
so, too, the great whore, the woman who sits upon the beast (for whose depiction the artist from nuremberg blithely helped himself to the portrait of a courtesan, a study he had brought back with him from venice) is largely prefigured in the very similar terminology of ezekiel

herr albin even showed him how to load them, and out in the open they practiced firing blanks with both pistols
all the langhalses, hagenströms, huneuses, kistenmakers, oeverdiecks, and möllendorpfs—whether business or professional men, couples or suitiers—had attended the party, which concluded with whist and several earfuls of music and was praised in the highest terms on the exchange for a good week afterward
but it’s his fault!
the woodwinds never cover the strings, but always allow them their tonal space and alternate with them, and in only a few passages are strings and woodwinds united in a tutti
he asked, lifting one eyebrow
it is clear that your nationalist mania loathes the world-conquering cosmopolitanism of the church
once it starts, there’ll be sleigh rides
last spring there had been a riot in the streets, although a new constitution commensurate with the demands of the times was already being drafted, and, indeed, despite the objections of lebrecht kröger and a few other obstinate old men, it had been adopted as the basic law of the city by decree of the senate
that exclamation echoed the predominant tone and spirit of these small-talker's dramatic fantasies
all the same, he gratefully accepted the coin
this announcement affected hans castorp even more than her previous news
or she might sit down on a chair beside the door and listen for ten minutes, only to vanish again without a sound
his english correspondence was exceptionally polished and effective, for he wrote english just as he spoke it—it rolled along in an effortless, simple, unconstrained, nonchalant stream
such people tend to be suspicious and bitter
the second person was costumed all in blue—eyebrows and lips tinted blue, the whole face and neck in fact painted blue, a blue woolen cap pulled down over one ear, and a case or slipcover of glazed blue linen, all one piece, pulled down over him, then tied with a string at the ankles and stuffed with pillows to round things off at the stomach
that was her reddish-blond hair, no more elegantly coiffed than usual, just a simple braid wound around her head; those were her lone-wolf eyes, her rounded neck, her lips, which seemed fuller than they were because they were accented by cheekbones that gave a charming concavity to her cheeks
it delighted me to think of her as adrian's partner in life, and i could indeed understand the feelings she instilled in him
he heard a voice murmur: speak to him
if there is a god, then the difference exists
young behrens came home on vacation now and then, and had in fact been there once already during joachim’s stay; and he told how it had been such a thrill for the ladies of the sanatorium—temperatures rose, little jealousies erupted into spats and skirmishes in the public lounging area, and a press of patients had appeared for dr krokowski’s private consultations
no, things are not going well for this family, not when there are grounds for scenes such as we’ve had here today
our defeat was merely a matter of time and of its cost to others-we could have laid down our weapons and forced our leaders to make an immediate peace, had we realized all this; but presumably only one or two of them even secretly allowed himself to think it
whereas you can also use the word human’ to cover up all sorts of weak-willed slovenliness
for the rest cure, what with this miserable cold weather
wehsal wanted to know
he was a man without vices, she said (she did not use that word, but some milder one, yet it was clear that was what she meant), a pure man-which explained his confiding familiarity, for purity has a confiding quality about it
added to which, she was very musical, a pianist, who was ardent in her love of chopin, had made some stabs at writing about schubert, and was a friend of more than one person who had made a name for himself in the realm of contemporary music
then the furniture vans lined up along meng strasse and the house was emptied out
he slipped the revolver back into his breast pocket, sat back down on his chair, crossed his legs, and lit another cigarette
yes, tom, right above the desk in your office, frau permaneder replied and gave her brother a hug
where does it come from?
it is all a matter of osmosis, my friend, in whose sportive products you early took such delight
i have kept a letter that adrian sent to me in freising from pfeiffering at the time-during his work, that is, on the hymn of praise by the
which is why i feel it my duty to correct you
and since frau chauchat was already moving toward the door to the room, peeperkorn let this headstrong young man go, although he stared after him for a good while, gazing over both his own shoulder and the malayan’s, his brow deeply creased in amazement at such an act of insubordination, to which his royal nature was quite unaccustomed
no, not in the least
you see, i was paying complete attention
there he would sit very quietly, one knee clasped in both hands, and listen: both to the music and to what was said
tony cried in despair
but of course, youth is capable of most anything
where are the glaciers and snowcapped, towering peaks?
a sudden hush came over the classroom, and everyone stood up in unison as dr mantelsack entered
yes, by god, i certainly do need that
that glance-which would remain unique to him, though one was not subjected to it frequently, but only now and then, and sometimes for no apparent reason-was indeed something new: mute, veiled, so aloof as to be almost offensive, and yet musing and cold with sadness, always ending in a not unfriendly, yet mocking smile with closed lips and in that gesture of turning away, which, however, was an old, familiar one
its natural squalor hidden, the world seemed to be under a spell of icy purity, trapped inside a fantastic dream of fatal enchantment
that could have meant some badly trodden corns for all parties
what was that supposed to mean?
only good manners prevented herr settembrini from breaking into mocking, carefree laughter
his plan was to get up early monday morning and do his stupid homework then—and that was that
is it not clear to you that purposed speculation on the charm that great guilt exercises upon goodness renders the very act of its grace utterly impossible?
holger’s admirers seemed not to be troubled by any of it
but why toughen them if civilization and progress demand there be no more war?

i’ve always tended to close things up inside me
you’re quite welcome here, my good herr grünlich, replied the consul, who along with his sons had stood up to shake their guest’s hand
it might be better not to have her sit, but to paint her from memory
at best one could have seen his lecture as devoted to the problem of freedom, which he treated as the basis for confusion
and his family shuddered at the despondency, cowardice, and lack of self-respect that had replaced it
people stand there, never flagging, while the dirty slush melts away under their feet; they look at one another, they crane their necks to see what is happening up front
will this weapon be able to avert substantial losses?
time, severe attacks very similar to seasickness returned, and kiirbis's diagnosis quickly began to waver, or rather was reinforced in a different sense-he was now certain in his belief that my friend's ailment should be treated as a chronic gastric catarrh with a significant dilation of the stomach on the right side, accompanied by hyperemia, which impaired the flow of blood to the brain
that blessing comes from my heart, and whether or not you may be of the same opinion, i feel that you can use it
the flow of blood was strong and persistent and kept him occupied for a good half hour, forcing him to run back and forth between the bench and the brook, rinsing out his handkerchief, sniffing water to rinse his nostrils, then lying down flat on the planks again, the wet cloth over his nose
you do understand, don’t you?
you do not want to know anything about other destinees, but only about your own, as something singular-!
as it was, for the last several weeks the group’s social activities had been restricted by the poor health of their chief, the great pieter peeperkorn, whose malign memento of the tropics refused to respond to either the exceptional climate or the antidotes prescribed by as excellent a physician as director behrens
the last flame was flickering behind him
a tooth—senator buddenbrook had died of a toothache, that was the word around town
she had never regarded this woman, who had entered the buddenbrook household much later than she, as a full-fledged member of the family; indeed, in her later years, she had begun to assume the airs of an old family retainer with exaggerated ideas of authority
i share your opinion completely, my good friend
as a cripple—gentlemen, you must grasp the situation in its entirety—leopardi lacked the love of a woman, and that in fact was what made him incapable of preventing his soul from being stunted
hans castorp waited, his eyes blinking, his lungs full of air
one beer, six milks
there was evening—and there had just been morning
fame and virtue lost their luster for him, he viewed nature as evil—and she is evil, stupid and evil, i agree with him there—and he despaired, horrible to say, he despaired of science and progress
there were six or seven people of various ages, from very young things to a few who were somewhat further along in years
frau stöhr called him a money magnet and could point to a pearl necklace that madame chauchat had been wearing with her evening gowns since her return and that in karoline’s opinion could hardly be considered evidence of transcaucasian marital gallantry, but rather was the result of shared travel expenses
but it is not at all proper to speak of such things at present
all this can be weighed quite calmly—indeed, must be weighed calmly, because it is a serious matter
i mean her first name
as he entered the dining room, gerda greeted him cheerfully
and in its musical substance, this piece-which has won, touched, enraptured even reluctant hearers-is, for him who has ears to hear and eyes to see, a reprise of the devil's laughter
the consul could not see her face; but it bore the same expression it had on many a summer evening, when she would lean against the little window of her room in travemünde
it was solely because he shared the all too charitable biases of his age, he said, that the great dante had taken that mediocre scribbler seriously and had assigned him such an important role in his own epic, a role to which herr lodovico probably assigned far too much masonic significance
as had been the case with several items in the story, this piece of information reminded hans castorp of his own grandfather, who likewise had worn black all the years his grandson had known him, although for reasons profoundly different from those of this grandfather here; hans castorp thought now of those old-fashioned clothes, the makeshift adaptation by which hans lorenz castorp’s true nature, belonging to a time long past, had indicated its dislike of the present, until in death he had solemnly returned to the form appropriate to him—in spanish ruff
two green folding tables had been set up for devotees of games—dominoes at the one, bridge at the other, although only young people were playing cards, among them herr albin and hermine kleefeld
i was going to have a baby
evidently you are amused at the idea of my serenus as a messenger of love
they shouldn’t make any special intellectual or emotional demands of him, and he wouldn’t make any of them
and the gently animated calm suddenly filled little johann with a delicious awareness of the quiet, well-tended, elegant seclusion of this resort, which he loved more than anything else
and perhaps even more explicitly than ignorant frau stöhr, she represented the union of sickness and stupidity that hans castorp had declared intellectually offensive—for which settembrini had rebuked him
but out of idealism and love for the beauty of song, he ignored his distress and, despite frequent sighs, gave it all he had, until finally he sank down at the base of a thick pine tree—totally out of breath and gasping, half-blind, with only bright patterns dancing before his eyes, his pulse skittering
just look at him lying there
he was one of the smallest boys, one of the grinds
and now, she cried, hop to, rudolf!
these few lines are penned to say that that same face has not ceased to float before his mind’s eye, that during all the suspense and anxiety of the last weeks he has never ceased to recall how last he saw it on that precious afternoon in your parents’ salon, when you let slip that half-promise with such modesty, and yet to what blissful effect
damned if that isn’t quite a hike through your house, buddenbrook!
this learned man engaged in such serious intellectual endeavors ?
what a shame—instead of listening, he was probably reading his russian grammar
kai worked on his new literary project the whole hour, and hanno kept himself occupied by conducting an orchestral overture
even hans castorp, despite his having once heard that kind, generous oh, please, go ahead and look emerge from the night, held back and at the last moment was quite prepared to let someone else go first
and here one bold word that comes from the experiences of our own time

good god, it was obviously no intoxicating bliss for a woman to sleep with helmut institoris!
and in short, herr settembrini’s unrelenting pedagogy could have packed its bags when confronted with those faces in the violent ward, on which a shudder of religious awe would have had a more humanizing effect than the sort of arrogant moralizing about reason with which this most worthy knight of the sun and vicar of solomon here had chosen to combat madness
i can only repeat that the paragraphs and asterisks in this book are simply a concession to the reader's eyes, and that if it were up to me, i would write the whole thing in one fell swoop, in one breath, without any divisions, indeed without paragraphs and indentations
at age eight or nine, adrian probably did not do so either
if she happened to be out shopping with him at the pastry shop, for example, she would never forget to reach coolly into one of the bowls of sweets on the counter and hand him something, without even thinking of paying—the baker should take it as an honor, shouldn’t he?
he thanked me for being kind enough to take his place, and i did not sit down again after greeting him this second time
they were on the main street between the kurhaus and the hotel belvedere, on the way back to davos-dorf
this happened in , at the end of may
he had been making false progress for a good while now; wrapped in a vortex of white night, he had worn himself out blindly working his way ever deeper into the indifferent menace
it was highly likely that it was a more decisive factor than her dislike of herr grünlich
and if in the course of both conversations, recorded and unrecorded, the genius of the place had called him, hans castorp, a joli bourgeois au petit endroit humide—in its way, a translation of settembrini’s phrase problem child of life—the question then was: which part of this mixed character would prove the stronger, the bourgeois or the other?
sophie had nodded once more and then vanished into thin air
now and then a book or publication would appear that everyone fought over, and even those who had given up reading would grab for it, with only pretended disinterest
but you mustn’t let it get you down, tom
monsignor hinterpfortner has already suggested it on occasion
for that we would not earn the price of an end that belongs to us
this sort of thing also occurs repeatedly in the thirteen brentano songs, to which i would definitely like to devote a few words before concluding this chapter-my example, in fact, was taken from the admirable serenade, hark, again the flute is weeping, with its final lines:
the phantom gentleman who had sat on his sofa in the twilight and nodded to him had, fortunately, not returned
sending two boxes of books and belongings by freight and carrying his always rather light baggage (including a portfolio housing his score and a rubber basin that had served him as a bathtub even in italy), he boarded a train at starnberger station, one of the locals that stopped not only in waldshut, but also, ten minutes later, at his goal in pfeiffering
the crystallization vessel in which this transpired was filled to three-quarters with a slightly mucilaginous liquid, diluted sodium silicate to be precise, and from the sandy bottom up rose a grotesque miniature landscape of different colored growths-a muddle of vegetation, sprouting blue, green, and brown and reminiscent of algae, fungi, rooted polyps, of mosses, too, but also of mussels, fleshy flower spikes, tiny trees or twigs, and here and there even of human limbs-the most remarkable thing my eyes had ever beheld, remarkable not so much because of their very odd and perplexing appearance, however, but because of their deeply melancholy nature
he still had it in his mouth when everyone stood up to leave
as the supervising physician, to be sure, he stood far aloof from anything to do with the commercial side of the operation
i think he is a good man, klothilde said softly, drawing out the words, although she was the only person in whom herr grünlich had shown not the least interest
hans castorp could feel those black eyes, that gaze of reason and morality, resting in deep mourning upon him, but went right on laying out his cards for a while, before he finally laid his cheek in one hand and stared up with a naughty child’s sullen look of false innocence
and, as always, bluish shadows lingered in the corners of her somewhat too small and somewhat too close-set brown eyes
well, as far as the devil went, he and herr settembrini had discussed him over a year ago
their cousins, on the other hand, the two sons of dr moritz hagenström the lawyer, were more delicate and gentle by nature, but they excelled in their studies and were model students—ambitious, respectful, quiet, and busy as bees, they almost quivered with alertness and were consumed with the idea of being the best in the class and bringing home a report card marked number one
accompanied by a piano, it was sung by a tenor, a fellow with tact and taste, who knew how to treat its simultaneously simple and sublime material with a great deal of good sense, musical feeling, and narrative restraint
toward morning he had had an attack of fever, which always left him exhausted and was accompanied now by the unpleasant consequences of drink
how pretty, healthy, clever, and happy they are
herr albin was commissioned to act as their spokesperson and to negotiate with whatever presences might appear, since he had taken part in séances on a few occasions prior to this
at home, his favorite stories were about his office in valparaiso, about the extreme heat that was the rule there, and about a young fellow from london named johnny thunderstorm, a gentleman of leisure, whom he had never seen do a lick of work, goddamn if i did, but who nevertheless had been a very clever businessman
that world, however, is apparently willing-whether blindly or correctly, i dare not decide-to take the loss into the bargain
often there were also certain children with me in the room, boys and girls, who sang me a motet from pages of notes, smiling right craftly the while and interchanging glances
in his absence they asked hans castorp about him, and people even came over from other tables to ask
hans castorp had once noticed them in the blowhard’s room and offered—against his better judgment, in a spirit of absolute neutrality—to borrow the pistols from him
it’s only too apparent sometimes that he’s not from the best of families, that unfortunately he did not enjoy what people call good breeding
and besides, most people find that sort of talk entertaining
he was no doubt welcome there, and there was equally no doubt that negotiations for his termination proceeded rather slowly in munich, where they were reluctant to let him go
thiefs, thiefs!, sending them all leaping from their beds
hans castorp looked around him—and what he saw was indeed uncanny and malicious
the room was filled with men with hands thrust into their trouser pockets, crossed behind their backs, or thrown into the air—all standing in little groups and arguing
and then he would accommodate the competition's social jealousies, by telling how he had been here and there yesterday, at the langewiesches' and all the rest of them; at the rollwagens', who had those two smashing daughters
his face and hands were brown from the sea air, but if their intention in sending him to the shore was to make him stronger, fresher, more energetic and robust, then they had failed miserably—and he was fully aware of that disheartening fact
he could not stand it
and then there’s the snow—it mixes everything higgledy-piggledy
but it was in god’s hands
he was as parsimonious as possible about anything that would not expose him to gossip—except for his own wardrobe, every bit of which he had made by a tailor in hamburg; he spared no expense in replenishing it and keeping it in repair
but when the puppy got back home,
a returnafter that parting?
drooping nose; a large, expressive mouth; and brown eyes whose gaze betrayed earnest kindness, and cleverness as well

the issue, however, is not me, but you
but a changed idea-is that still a fresh idea at all?
but that does not mean i think the trial will go in his favor
all those things you have established in regard to morality, you and your ailing compatriot—do you seriously suppose they surprise me?
perhaps there were exceptions, people who spent the hours of their rest cure with some sort of serious intellectual pursuit, some rewarding study of one topic or another, even if they did so only to maintain contact with life on the plains or to give a little weight to time, a deeper draft to its keel, and prevent it from becoming pure time and nothing else
a few days later, at the corner of breite and meng strasse, as she was returning from a walk, tony ran into herr grünlich
it gives me the illusion of independence
i’ll write more about it as soon as possible
the large carved chest, the gold-plated candelabra, and the other items that now belonged to the senator and his wife were hauled off to fischer grube
was he walking by the sea, that professor who was first struck by this notion, the faint bitter taste of eternity on his lips?
he would rail (behind his brother's back) against such provocative license and could not be brought around by his sister's conciliatory words, who alleged that the lawyer suffered from an excess of blood, putting him in constant danger of an apoplectic stroke due to the heat and thus necessitating light apparel
in the resounding baritone of the occupant, with that exotic, tapped r sound and a diphthongized distortion of the vowel—and saw his cousin vanish into the twilight of dr krokowski’s analytical pit
his fiancee was not in attendance, by the way-but had already returned to paris, so one heard
bullinger said, employing one of the standard phrases that for some time now had been a favorite of aesthetes and connoisseurs as a way of crudely tempering the awestruck beautiful
he dropped all his rs as he said it, and black came out as bleck—and his face was so convincingly comic at depicting this extuhnal sleekness and dapperness that they all broke into laughter

yes, in the contemplation of this music, admiration and sadness mingled in the most peculiar way
in simple terms, he agreed to the divorce
it was not unusual for him to be unsettled by his own scruples, to feel divided and perplexed in his attitudes toward the world’s larger constellations
that was japoll—but there wasn’t much to salvage there
but did you know his sister is divorced?
i might add that i have played a personal role in the destinies of our buddenbrooks on a few occasions
though he be called suso, yet of a truth is named praestigiar, did rise up and assail your ears with such hellish yelping and bawling, insomuch as you have ventured such trouble and burthen for my sake
for his part, hans castorp regretted this standstill and thought with pride and concern about honor-loving joachim, who with one heroic, courageous effort had ripped to shreds the tough fabric of rhadamanthine rhetoric, sought out his flag, and now, in hans castorp’s imagination, stood clutching it, three fingers of his right hand raised to swear his oath of loyalty
this substance could then stream from the medium and temporarily congeal outside his or her body to form biologically living organs, which served as grasping mechanisms, the hands that performed those astonishing trifles they had all witnessed in dr krokowski’s laboratory
her moist handkerchief still in her hand, she sat upright on her pillows and said angrily, four years
they still haven’t invented rays that can get through layers of fat like those
my cousin and i
they knew that in our last hours all our loved ones who have gone before come to gather us to them with hymns and blessings
god has not blessed us with children, but what would have been mine had i outlived you, let it devolve on him when the day comes that you follow me to that better world, that he may enjoy something of it in this life
for the gas fireplace behind the semicircle was putting out heat
and so october passed, and november, too
for instance, did the seven weeks he had demonstrably, indubitably spent with these people here feel like a mere seven days?
attack and defense were the same in our case; together they formed the high emotion of our ordeal, of our callipg, of the great moment, of sacred necessity
the third day, the morning of the third day, brought with it gentle release
coffee cups in hand, plates of cake on their knees, they silently picnicked in the tumult
hearing his sister’s steps in the dining room, he removed the pince-nez and gazed anxiously into the darkness until tony entered through the portieres and moved out into the light
it’s six this round, but that’s no reason to be down in the dumps
tony carefully waded up through the tall, sharp rushes bordering the exposed beach
they should not, however, interpret it as mystification, as mere setting of the mood
thus he had also refused adrian's proposal that he furnish the libretto to love 's labour's lost
but your emphasis on that verb leaves me cold, inasmuch as the heroic age that wrested’ your ideals came to an end long ago—those ideals are dead, or at best lie twitching in their death throes, and those whom they had hoped to finish off have got their foot in the door again
no, hans castorp insisted with a ferocity not at all appropriate to the mild objection joachim had offered
art's vital need for revolutionary progress and achievement of the new depends on the vehicle of the strongest subjective sense for what is hackneyed, for what has nothing more to say, for those standard, normal means that have now become 'impossible'; and so art helps itself to apparently unvital elements: personal weariness and intellectual boredom, the disgust that comes with perceiving 'how it's done,  the cursed proclivity to see things in light of their own parody, the 'sense of the comic'-what i am saying is: art, in its will to live and progress, puts on the mask of these dull-hearted personal traits in order to manifest, objectivize, and fulfill itself in them
that definitely put an end to chivalry—why not go ahead and shoot at each other separated by only a handkerchief!
it’s different with you
let it be, my child
for the most part-one might say, almost always-she traveled, leaving her homes, of which she apparently was not fond and from which restlessness or painful memories drove her, to the care of managers and major-domos
i am afraid i do not have at my command the means to express, to drive home my feelings and wishes-particularly not in the company of others, before whom i really am somewhat embarrassed to play the lady's man and cavalier
that would continue until the next fad took over—when, for instance, the collection and incessant consumption of chocolate in every conceivable form might become the fashion
i was thinking only recently that it’s really foolish the way the local ladies carry on about death and things connected with it, that everyone is so skittish, protecting them and making sure the last rites are brought while they’re downstairs eating
should i not have done so?
of late, however, although the transition had been so gradual his audience had scarcely noticed, his interests had moved in a new direction, toward magical, arcane matters; and his fortnightly lectures in the dining hall—the sanatorium’s main attraction, the pride of its brochure—which were always delivered from behind a cloth-covered table in an exotic, drawling accent, to an immobile audience of berghof residents and for which he always wore a frock coat and sandals, no longer dealt with masked forms of love in action or the transformation of illness back into conscious emotion, but with the abstruse oddities of hypnotism and somnambulism, the phenomena of telepathy, prophetic dreams, and second sight, the wonders of hysteria; and as he discussed these topics, philosophic horizons expanded until suddenly his audience beheld great riddles shimmering before their eyes, riddles about the relationship between matter and the psyche, indeed, the very riddle of life itself, which, so it appeared, might be more easily approached along very uncanny paths, the paths of illness, than by the direct road of health
the crack of the shot raised echoes all around
joachim had claimed a seat with his coat, plaid blanket, and roses
you’ve suddenly come to a halt, have you?
jakobs has done it in the finest taste, as always
barely twenty years old, but already graying and balding, the patient was emaciated, his skin waxen; he had large hands, large ears, a large nose; grateful to the point of tears for this diversion and their encouraging words, he actually wept a little out of weakness as he greeted them and accepted the bouquet

the four guests from the berghof had run into settembrini there, and then quite by chance naphta had joined them
and as far as the rest goes?
by the time you get back to göttingen you’ll have forgotten everything
in rubber boots and with a turned-up coat collar, he accompanied his cousin again for the first time up to the bench beside the water trough and back
all the same, he was touched and glad that the ice had been broken; for despite his trophy, the macabre gift that he wore next to his heart, he was very fond of herr settembrini, set great store by his presence, and the thought of being totally rejected and abandoned would have weighed down on him more heavily than had the feeling of being a schoolboy no longer in the running and enjoying the advantages of disgrace, just like herr albin
i do hope that you’ll make yourself comfortable and soon feel right at home here with us
why are you forever cringing and writhing?
only we germans have both together

herr stanislaw von zutawski chose the shortest, and in his considered opinion most thorough and, given the circumstances, most appropriate course of action, after having been indirectly informed that herr kasimir j apoll intended to leave the aforementioned town the following day,
the cousins, the one with a brick-red face, the other tanned bronze, walked along without overcoats, which would only have been burdensome in the glaring sun—young ziemssen wearing sport clothes and rubber galoshes, hans castorp dressed much the same, though in long trousers, since he was not the sort who gave much thought to his physique
but naphta had also visited madhouses, and he recalled having entered a violent ward, the kind of place that offered scenes and images for which, good god, herr settembrini’s reasonable stare and decorous influence would hardly have been a match
but a day without tobacco—that would be absolutely insipid, a dull, totally wasted day
his bloodshot eyes wandered eastward for help, to the far left-hand corner of the dining hall
you have not been residing here among us for so long now that, taken all in all, the question can be removed just yet from the agenda
a thirty-two-year-old man of medium height came across the garden, hat and cane in the same hand, his stride rather short, his head thrust forward; he wore worsted gloves and a yellow-green wool coat of long cut
how could hans castorp not have held work in high esteem?
go ahead and piddle your life away, just as you’ve done so far
feeble, very feeble, this advertiser of ours, he said
the next morning she gave almost everyone in the dining hall a colorful box of konfekti as a memento and then left on her little trip with the two girls
in the case of brahms, for whom he had very high regard, he showed adrian the allusions to archaic elements, to old church modes, and how this ascetic component opened an avenue onto somber riches and dark abundance
yes, castorp, he said—and this was the first time he had ever addressed the young man simply by his last name—just as i thought, the situation looks rather praeter-propter
how long had joachim actually lived up here with him, whether measured until his wild departure or taken as a whole?
she lived in the twilight of her curtained rooms, seldom went out, and dreaded the sun, the dust, the common people in their sunday best, the smell of coffee, beer, and tobacco
our smallest unit of time is the month
the lamps haven’t even been lit yet
wehsal rode alone in the second carriage as it wound its way up the looping drive to the portal of the berghof, where they all parted
and the needs of my heart, are they to count for nothing?
all the same, he remained determined to put to immediate good effect the bustle of arrival, the hearty billowing of his breath in the cold air, the warmth of his quick walk in the winter morning
i: and yet it is only by means of this non plus ultra that one arrives at the highest enhancement of dramatically theological existence, which is to say: at the most reprobate guilt and, through it, at the last and irresistible provocation of infinite goodness
it takes two for a divorce, my child
tony fell into a dreamy half-sleep, her head nodding under a big, flat straw hat and a gray parasol, which she had propped against the folded-back carriage top
he gestured with both hands for those present to look at joachim, insisting they mourn with him
bathing and swimming, dr langhals had said
this, however, caused that sweet face to look strangely, horribly deformed; and especially when accompanied by fits of teeth-gnashing that were soon part of the affliction, the impression created was that of a child possessed
naphta, who had cast his coat aside in the snow so that the mink lining was visible, started walking, pistol in hand, toward the outer heel mark as soon as it was drawn, before ferge was even done with the other lines
the absolute, the holy terror these times require, can arise only out of the most radical skepticism, out of moral chaos
madame chauchat was also wearing a belted coat of some warm, fuzzy, large-checked fabric, and had even thrown a little fur over her shoulders
; a lucky find like mendelssohn's on the wings of song, the invention of a musician whom adrian would extol highly to me, saying that metrically he was the richest of allwhat fruitful topics for discussion!
but this aroused such a storm of protest from frau permaneder that gerda had to put the idea aside for the time being
and then i learned that this was often the case
such measurements might well have brought forth disconcerting results—particularly given joachim’s dreadfully excited state, in which he would by turns flush darkly with joy and grow pale with anticipation
settembrini came, was sympathetic and charming—and having always called joachim lieutenant, he now addressed him as capitano
and so you propose to spend the winter with us, do you?
yes, methyl aldehyde, even the toughest bacteria can’t take that—hco, but it does burn in your nose, doesn’t it?

one possibility was fiissen, with nearby neuschwanstein
he glided on rubber soles, so salzmann said, to keep the dying from hearing his approach
he had uttered this last word more softly than any he had spoken thus far—and without gestures, at most, a quick flash of his glasses
he leapt to his feet, but immediately sat back down and cried in a wavering voice that first faltered, broke, and then, in its joy, found itself again, ah, thank you, thank you!
he was fairness personified
she silently reached for her pince-nez with her other hand, and as her mouth slowly opened wide, she read the notice—and then let out two cries of horror, pressing the palms of both hands to her cheeks and holding her elbows out wide from her body
a telegram announcing his imminent arrival was sent directly to the estate, whereupon, or so i assume, hastily agreed-upon arrangements flew back and forth between there and some hotel in vienna
we know that spirit—thanks, but no thanks
yes—no—the way one knows things here
and she’s cooperative, even prepares some of our northern dishes, under my direction; yesterday, for instance, we had sorrel and raisins, but permaneder was so upset with this vegetable dish of mine (although he did pick out the raisins with his fork) that he wouldn’t speak to me the rest of the day, just grumbled to himself
clarissa received the registered letter in pfeiffering, where, for a few weeks since the closing of the theater season in pforzheim, she had been a guest at her mother's little house behind the chestnut trees
fine, joachim said, that’s what we’ll do for now
germany is free, insofar as one can call a devastated nation deprived of its sovereignty free, and it may be that nothing now stands in the way of my returning to my profession

countless numbers of these unmanned, winged messengers of destruction were fired from the coast of france and fell exploding over southern england and, if we are not totally deceived, will soon have proved to be a veritable calamity for our foes
her mother said, advise you to consent, my child?
he even took his skis in the cablecar to the top of schatzalp to glide about happily up there, abducted into a world of shimmering, powdery slopes, sixty-five hundred feet above sea level, from where in good weather he had a glorious panorama of the scene of his adventures
and yet it would doubtless be—should i ascribe it to the influence, shall we say, to the pedagogic principles of signor settembrini that in regard to your own chivalrous impulses, you have—i beg you, please understand me when i say
people wear their best black clothes and take their hats off and gaze at the coffin and seem so serious and devout—and no one dares make bad jokes, the way they normally do

the hunchbacked mexican, who, because he knew none of the languages represented here, wore the expression of a deaf-mute, was forever taking photographs—a comical figure nimbly dragging his tripod from one point on the terrace to another

they left orders for them to be delivered to the sanatorium at once: international sanatorium berghof, room
and now the row of wooden beach pavilions, with their little round roofs lay before them, and beyond that, closer to the water, the wicker beach chairs with families encamped around them in the warm sand: ladies with pince-nez tinted blue and library books; gentlemen in light-colored suits, lazily drawing figures in the sand with their walking sticks; tanned children under immense straw hats—shoveling, tumbling, digging for water, baking pies in wooden plates, burrowing tunnels, wading up to their naked knees in the low surf, sailing little ships
as behrens entered, there was a burst of bright, merry laughter inside the room, but any words were broken off as the door closed
i cannot describe the suspense with which i looked forward to that gathering
what held him back were scruples of conscience—although it was patently most unconscionable to pay no attention to time
he gathered up some writing materials to take out with him for his rest cure—because there could be no more delays, a letter home, his third, would have to be written—and went on being angry, muttering things about this windbag and quibbler, who was sticking his nose into things that were none of his business, but who hummed little songs at girls in public
he had learned from naphta that settembrini was a freemason—which made no less an impression on him than had the italian’s revelation of naphta’s jesuit origins and patronage

but if she’s been walking rapidly, then she can whistle from inside, and of course she uses it then to startle people, especially newly arrived patients

i am supposed to join in for these few weeks, hans castorp said with a laugh, looking down at the ground
he drank a bottle at every main meal, sometimes one and a half, even two, not to mention the bread, with which he started every meal, including first breakfast
do you still recall ?
i certainly am, joachim replied
for this much is surely clear, that i have not dwelt at length on the preceding primarily in order to explain why i did not feel particularly comfortable in halle, but rather for the same reason that i went into such detail about wendell kretzschmar's lectures in kaisersaschern: that is, because it is and must be my concern for the reader to be a witness to adrian's intellectual experiences
who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
it will do me good
and he was delighted that he had regained the capacity

but they also enabled him to perceive, understand, and internalize the ever-intensifying accent on shock and indescribable adventure that people up here, both generally and individually, attributed to the matter

his change of mind occurred while he was alone in the music room one evening, playing yet once again the recording stamped with the personality of valentin, for whom he felt such great sympathy
when it was repeated, he protested vigorously
every sensual act implies tenderness, after all, is an act of giving even as lust is taking, is happiness in making another happy, a demonstration of love
main thing is, i been hank’rin’ to pay my respects to you, lovely lady, and to see frau grünlich again
he then laid it as carefully as possible on the rim of his washstand and decided for now to put on his overcoat and finish his rest cure
and if some one or another of my men should happen to take one along as a souvenir …’
hans castorp had been in the music room and came out to see what had become of joachim, and he found him standing in front of the tiled stove, next to marusya’s chair—a rocking chair and joachim was holding onto it with his left hand, tilting it back, so that marusya was in a reclining position, looking up out of her little, round, brown eyes into joachim’s face, which was bent down over hers, uttering soft, disjointed phrases, to which she would occasionally respond with a smile or a nervous, disparaging shrug
the hundredth anniversary would soon be upon them
it was not deep in relation to its width, and on all four sides was a kind of passageway where the sideboards stood and that opened as a series of arches onto the central dining area
and to be fair, he had to admit that a hand had now been offered him, now, when the impossible was perhaps not quite so impossible as it would be later—joachim’s wild departure could be a support, a guiding hand on the road back to the flatlands, which he would never, ever find all on his own
and although one of her fur-lined galoshes keeps flapping open in this slush and slows her down dreadfully, she outruns them all
is it truly still a danger, or already a fixed and settled fact?
he picked up the red case with a smile and opened it
in the sudden silence, the senator stood tall and erect for a moment, staring at the door through which his brother had vanished
two months before i arrived, a student who had been here for a long time went for his checkup—and then hanged himself out in the woods
yes, tom, i’m bored something awful
i never would have thought that i’d see him so clearly again
so you like being at the shore, do you?
he: your curiosity is boyish and indiscreet
as you might guess, it has to do with surgery, an operation that they perform up here
when class was over, dr mantelsack would chat quite genially with them
like thomas aquinas, they regarded trade in general—the basic commercial act of buying and selling for a profit without having altered or improved the product—as a despicable occupation
hans castorp gathered his wits to try to catch up, but did not succeed right away, since he had not heard the beginning and then had missed still more of it while contemplating frau chauchat’s rounded back
o satana, o ribellione!
it took them the whole break between classes; then the bell rang and dr marotzke appeared
en fin, the connections i owed to the fourberies came in handy for me and even multiplied when i then opened my office for arranging performances of contemporary music
i admit that it took a while before i realized that although on the one hand the church did not wish to be seen as uninvolved, neither was it ready to bless an avowed suicide, however honorable-in short, that what this sturdy gentleman really wanted was for me to lie
the effect, then, was rather unpleasant, but that did not prevent hugo weinschenk from being a hardworking, energetic, and respectable young man who earned twelve thousand marks courant a year—or from being, in erika grünlich’s eyes, a handsome man
we all love people like that, whether we want to or not, because when they annoy us with their carelessness, the annoyance becomes just one more reason for being fond of them
but what did the masses want?
he stood there in a limp pose, his eyes directed to the floor, and in a faint, languid voice he said, father …
and naphta maliciously agreed, saying that it certainly was not a question of any lack of technical skill
but i wanted to say something else
the only thing this prosaic young man had retrieved from his hour of adventure, however, had been the shadowy token of a pledge—the possibility, bordering on a probability, that frau chauchat would return here, sooner or later, for a fourth stay, just as the illness, which indeed gave her such freedom, might dispose
she smiled in response to the calls, fully aware that her outfit looked good on her
what was the point of these tortures, of clinging to life in such an expensive, artificial way, when the case was hopeless?
how would one possibly manage without them?
and back there, on the other side of the hall, is another, larger room
apostasy is an act of faith, and everything is and happens in god-falling away from him most especially
fine, then i shall accept the consequences
meanwhile little johann played some piano pieces he had practiced with herr pfühl and accompanied his mother in a mozart sonata—not without several mistakes but with a rich full sound
something like nausea stirred in him again; but he was too exhausted to think about that
but now he suddenly sat up and said gruffly, don’t you have any money on you, christian?
and after thinking it over calmly, you’ll find that there’s nothing unthinkable about it
in any case, she was the great-aunt of the yogurt-eating girl, and both were permanent residents of the sanatorium
just think, there was a boy who answered to the name of schappeler, and then there was a certain 'social' arzt
she stammered the same sentence three or four times: you’ve made a mistake
i was speaking with captain kloot down at the docks this morning
wiedemann had a quick, furtive glance
in other words: the reality of magic, of demonic influence and bewitchment was thereby confirmed, and certain phenomenalike the evil eye, an empirical complex concentrated in the saga of the basilisk's deadly glance-were thus wrested from the realm of socalled superstition
it was a little past three-thirty when a technical assistant who worked down here opened the door to admit the lucky swedish bruiser—evidently his predecessor had been let out by way of another exit
the vernal equinox now lay three months in the past, the summer solstice had arrived
the latter, in particular, prevailed in naphta’s order, which had originated in spain and whose rules of spiritual exercise—in some sense the equivalent of those that frederick the great later promulgated for his prussian infantry—were first drawn up in spanish, so that naphta frequently used spanish phrases in his stories and lessons
to what extent hans castorp’s calm, callous self-assurance made things seem that way, and to what extent they actually were that way, making any other course of action indeed inconceivable and impossible—that was, from the very start, something no well-bred gentleman could have decided
he could see her knee outlined under her skirt, the back of her neck bent forward under the short, reddish-blond hairs that hung loose from the tucked-up braid, saw the neck bones sticking out—and the shudder passed over him once again
a lack of noble intent—the church?
it certainly looked as if the last few years had rounded out his education
two tall, massive chinese vases were set on the marble mantel, above which hung a mirror
would you allow me—and here herr settembrini bent forward on his chair, and with a smile he placed both feet on the floor, tucked his folded hands between his knees, and thrust his head forward at a slight tilt—would you allow me, he repeated with some emotion in his voice, to lend you a helping hand in your exercises and experiments and to play a corrective role whenever i see danger looming in the form of some pernicious fixation?
amongst those rustic blandishments!
and let pfiffi buddenbrook sit here every thursday jiggling with joy at my misfortune, let her say, well, how sad
the coarse paper revealed some curious remarks on the subject
you ran around in a circle, toiling onward, with the feeling in your heart of doing something useful, when in fact you were tracing a wide, foolish arc that led back on itself, just as the teasing year came full circle
which he did—just so that he and clavdia could meet head-on, which was something quite different, more dangerous and more intensely alluring than when she walked before or behind him
or perhaps i should say, above the mold, for that was how the boy had announced his satisfaction that the mizzle had whicknend the mold
but let us leave aside for now the place and its particularities
let the exorcism begin
what lord berowne calls barbarism-that is, whatever is spontaneous and natural-celebrates no triumphs in this music
and there were certain religious and moral reasons as well—they had heard all about them at the university, although they might not be able to recall them precisely at the moment
that was inexperience speaking
their relation to the oeverdiecks was a distant one and would be quite useless after the mayor’s death
once this came to light, it seemed imperative that she be placed under the strict supervision of a boarding school, the one run by fäulein weichbrodt, mühlenbrink
and here i am stagnating like an old water hole—a stinking pond, and that’s not too crude a comparison, either
it very quickly recognizes itself in restraint, finds fulfillment in subordinating itself to law, rule, coercion, system-finds fulfillment in them, but that does not mean it ceases to be freedom
because i, too, have seen some marvelous cases of acclimatization
i’m coming along, thomas, he said flatly
you depend upon my pride's preventing me from the remorse necessary to salvation, yet do not make account of there being a prideful remorse-that of cain, who was of the fast opinion that his sin was greater than could e'er' be forgiven him
but what i mean is, vice is surely not insensitive to such terrors, but on the contrary, gives them their full and just due, to the extent that what drives a man to vice is the failure of feeling in the face of the classic gifts of life; which therefore does not imply, or does not necessarily imply, an insult to life, since it might equally as well be interpreted as an embracing of life
god forbid that such an awful thing should happen
he let the candle burn, because there was still not enough daylight
we’ll have to wait and see what comes of it
decomposition, corruption, hans castorp said, but that’s really just a kind of burning off, isn’t it?
from here one entered the grand hall with its vast parquet floor and four high windows, with wine-red curtains and a view to the garden; this room, too, ran the full width of the house
joachim behaved with perfect propriety and kept his eyes lowered
never had thomas buddenbrook so impressed his brother as at this moment
theologically speaking, kumpf was an advocate of that intermediary conservatism with critical-liberal infusions that i mentioned before
his smile was as terrible as his anger
at home he gave the impression of a very energetic, prudent, and—despite his elegance—cold, practical man of business; but when traveling in regions whose customs were strange to him, in the south of germany, for instance, he was all too quick to be polite and self-effacing and assumed a certain impetuous amiability, which was in no way the result of insecurity about his own culture, but on the contrary reflected both an awareness of its solid integrity and a desire to improve on his own aristocratic tendencies—even amid customs he found simply incredible, he would show no surprise whatever
yes, it’s a perfectly justifiable question, if you please
it was indeed also the period during which before my eyes fateful developments unfolded for certain individuals within our circle of acquaintance, developments scarcely noti<;:ed by the larger world, of course, but that would lead to catastrophes of which these pages will have to speak, because some of them closely touched the life and fate of my hero, adrian leverkiihn-indeed, as i am profoundly aware, because in one of them he was actively involved in a mysteriously fatal way
the lower part of the face, however, was long and narrow and was neither buddenbrook nor kröger, but most decidedly belonged to his mother’s side of the family
but from the way it quickly moved past it, treating it no differently than any unnumbered mark, it was evident that the whole set of numerals and strokes had only been laid under its path, and that it just kept going, and going
we had indeed occasionally agreed-or more accurately, we had seconded the commonly expressed opinion-that philosophy is the queen of the sciences
his body felt nothing; they could have burned and pinched him, it would have made no difference to joachim at that point
then i know what i must do, she said
he was in göttingen
his parents took the little coffin back home with them
the krögers’ son jürgen, the postal official from rostock, is home on a visit—a quiet man, dressed very simply
two bearded men were coming toward him, axes on their shoulders, but then, not all that far from him, they took leave of one another
i can’t go on
they passed soundlessly down the coconut runners of the narrow corridor
and they laughed and shrugged
a source of endless wonder that one flesh lusts after another; it is indeed a phenomenon-yes, well, the perfectly exceptional phenomenon of love
per-mit me, please, to continue
my residence is in hamburg, but i am on the road a great deal
the topic of conversation continued to be the pietà, for hans castorp kept both one eye and his remarks fixed on it as he turned now to herr settembrini, trying to bring him into critical contact, as it were, with the work of art, even though the humanist’s aversion to this bit of decor could very easily be read from the expression on his face when he twisted around to look at it—he had taken a seat with his back to that particular corner
his illness is to blame for his not having gone further by now
for one associated the idea of the exclusively personal with that of a boundless subjectivity and a radical will to harmonic expression, as opposed to polyphonic objectivity (and he asked us to fix that differentiation in our minds: harmonic subjectivity, polyphonic detachment); and yet, as with the late masterpieces in general, that comparison, that antithesis did not work here
i have no other family than that, since i was orphaned very early
what are you thinking of asking, tom?
so that’s what causes flushed cheeks, hans castorp said
being lifted like this into regions whose air he had never breathed before and whose sparse and meager conditions were, as he well knew, both unfamiliar and peculiar—it all began to excite him, to fill him with a certain anxiety
the hands pointed to ten after six
the theory of infinite space and time—that was definitely based on experience, was it?
all the same, hans castorp’s praise was justified
nothing—although it was twenty-four hours
poor as a church mouse, he was having trouble at the time with his neglected and decaying teeth and talked of nothing but perfidious dentists who had pretended to treat him out of friendship, but then suddenly presented
it was the same with the word inspiration, which one definitely had to avoid in his company-if need be, by substituting a phrase like fresh idea
it may perhaps never be known, never recorded in any biography
the upshot was that she had come back up here in an overblown state, with constriction of the heart and shortness of breath—ha!
and here i crept to the back, because when you came in i thought you were an organ of the pedagogic body
this organ-grinder and his insinuations had definitely spoiled the mood for it
the nature and essence of this nearly thirty-minute orchestral portrait of the world is mockery-a mockery that confirms only too well the opinion i expressed in our conversation that the pursuit of what is immeasurably beyond man can provide piety no nourishment; a luciferian travesty; a sardonic lampoon apparently aimed not only at the dreadful clockwork of the universe, but also at the medium in which it is painted, indeed repeated: at music, at the cosmos of tones
as for von riedesel, he had fallen prey to utter confusion
do not speak to me of some spiritual redemption’ that may result from illness—for god’s sake, do not speak of it
to hell with gaffky!

she goes to the wardrobe, takes out mother’s silk dresses, flings them over her arm, and starts to leave the room
but he was not cross, said nothing whatever about it
joachim did not ask him whether he had liked the lecture, and hans castorp said nothing about it, either

i hoped to send you off to your work, and now you will be fighting alongside your fellows
she herself had been repaid in the process by being able to cater to her relaxed, southern german lust for life, in the hope of making up what she had missed, all the while allowing the men she invited-knoterich, kranich, zink, and spengler, �hose young acting students, etc-to pay court to her declining beauty
they celebrated the evening of december  at the senator’s home, but without the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse and without the old krögers
and now deutschlin made the motion that leverkiihn be allowed to finish what he had to say
oh, ida, i’ve been thinking about the past so much of late, back when grünlich first appeared and the scenes he made—it was scandalous, ida
uncle justus, still a gallant man, strode toward her and almost bowed as he took her hand and spoke a few well-chosen words
there was one instrument, however-that was to say, one medium of musical realization-through which music was, to be sure, made audible, but in a way that was only semi-sensual, almost abstract, and thus strangely consistent with its intellectual nature: that was the piano
i’ve made my share of mistakes… but now i’m off to the club
i vaguely remember something about lemon buns with greasy sausage—some sort of truly ghastly morning snack
and you don’t say one word to me about it
elisabeth buddenbrook’s masterpiece, russian preserves, a spicy mixture of fruits conserved in spirits, was passed around
cuts were inevitable in any case
but the danger of being uncreative-what do you say?
a few weeks before, he had received a letter from monsieur monteux, the director of the russian ballet in paris and formerly of the colonne orchestra; in it the conductor, as a friend of experiment, had announced his intention to perform marvels of the universe along with some orchestral pieces in a straight concert version of love's labour's lost
behrens is quite an expert at it
but all i deserve now is some cold coffee
nor did he do any better when breisacher's cultural-critical peroration moved on to matters
sometimes an officer would pass by in a greatcoat with an upturned collar, both hands in his pockets, hot on the heels of some sweet young shopgirl, but quite aware, too, of the admiring glances of the other young ladies from good families; and then each sentry would stand in front of his guardhouse, inspect himself from top to bottom, and present arms
i will also be discreet about any matter that demands my discretion, and especially keep secret all things that must be kept secret
oh certainly, nurse mylendonk
it simply seemed worth mentioning that i called him adrian, whereas he, when not evading use of a name entirely, called me zeitblom
now and then, when he found no one at the club, christian would drop by as well for a glass of benedictine; he talked about his intention to act as the agent for a firm that sold champagne and cognac—he knew something about that and it would be easy, pleasant work, you were your own boss, you occasionally jotted down a few orders in your notebook, and, quick as a wink, you had made thirty thalers; he then immediately borrowed forty shillings from frau permaneder so that he could present a bouquet to the leading lady at the municipal theater, and by some association of ideas—god only knew what they were—found himself talking about maria and the depravities of london, moved on to the story about the mangy dog that had been shipped in a box from valparaiso to san francisco, and, now that he was rolling, went on to tell a wealth of stories with such verve and wit that he could have entertained a whole crowded auditorium
vivacious, you know, vim and vigor
and so he secretly scouted for an occasion to test himself-himself, but her as well, for he could not distrust himself without soft, indeed tender, though fearful suspicion being cast back on the girl on whom his soul hung
accompanied by frizzy-haired tamara and her tablemate with the concave chest, a bulgarian in evening dress, she crossed the room, moving toward the table where gänser and kleefeld were sitting—and brushing past hans castorp’s table in her new dress
life shuddered at such perfect precision, regarded it as something deadly, as the secret of death itself; and hans castorp thought he understood why the architects of ancient temples had intentionally and covertly built little deviations from symmetry into their rows of columns
committi�g you herewith to god, that he may defend you and all innocent hearts-your very humble servant, as was said in halle-as for that jape and prank due to which there be something afoot twixt satan and myself, i have made you far too curious: 'twas nothing more than that as night fell on that first day, said porter led me astray-a churl, a rope round his gut, with red cap and brass badge, in a rain mantle, speaking the same devilish tongue as every man here, with jutting bristled jaw, and by my lights looked somewhat like our schleppfuss by reason of his small beard, in truth looked right like him, when i think on it, or may have grown more like in my remembering
it was almost merely for form’s sake, a matter of convention, that the gathering presumed the ghosts of the departed would speak by means of a glass
and when the memory of it came back to him, its vivid clarity stayed within normal, healthy bounds; and then hans castorp would pull from his breast pocket the glass memento that he kept in a heavy envelope he carried in his wallet—a little rectangle, which when held parallel to the ground was a black, opaque, reflective surface, but when held up to the sky, grew light and revealed very humanistic things: the transparent picture of a human body, with rib cage, the outline of the heart, the curve of the diaphragm, the bellows of the lungs, plus scapulae and humeri, all surrounded by a pale, hazy halo, the flesh—of which, against all reason, hans castorp had tasted on mardi gras
you were just completing your period of bed rest after having been accepted as a patient
the complex included forests and meadows, a half-dozen athletic fields, agricultural buildings, including stalls for hundreds of cows

her veil blows back and her flushed face is visible; but that is unimportant now
it was almost suffocating to have that hand so close to his eyes—you had to look at it, whether you wanted to or not, to study its inherent humanness and all its defects, as if you were holding a magnifying glass to it
but his hair had been trimmed just as he had always worn it in life, and herr wenzel had used a curling iron to set and curl his mustaches, so that they extended well beyond his white cheeks
the preachers in town likewise came and went as friends of the house
she looked her very best in a becoming olive winter suit trimmed with narrow bands of brown fur, and more or less obeying my emotionssimply because i knew what was coming-i delighted over and over in looking at her black eyes, at that merry sheen of pitch and coal beneath the shade of her lashes
tony, she then said in gentle reproach, and after carefully extracting the large pin that held tony’s hat in place and laying the hat on the window seat, she lovingly stroked her daughter’s ash-blond hair with both hands, calming her
now that the wind had picked up, the evening had turned noticeably cooler
yet even though hans castorp was prepared, as he had been all along, to lend him an ear, to consider his lectures worth listening to—quite noncommittally—and to let himself be pedagogically influenced, that in no way meant that, on the basis of a strictly educational point of view, he should desist from his enterprise, which still seemed to have an important impact, to be beneficial in some vague way—despite madame gerngross and her talk about a nice little fleert, despite the businesslike personality of poor young rotbein or the foolish trillings of lady overblown
then know this: we pledge to you the vital efficacy needed for what you will accomplish with our help
wasn’t he ever going to be able to calm down?

they could hear the bowing, the tremolo in the fingers as they slid sweetly from one position to the next and found their melody, a waltz, ach, ich habe sie verloren
it ran in a determined zigzag from token to token, but pulling back slightly toward the middle with each move; it ran to the h, to the o, to the l, after which it seemed to grow weary and confused, not to know what to do, but then it recovered, found the g, the e, and the r just as they thought!
a slight misunderstanding, pastor mathias said in confusion
in the same way, the body, and love of the body, too, are indecent and disagreeable; the body’s surface blushes and turns pale because it is afraid and ashamed of itself
she stared at him with large, sad eyes that slowly began to glisten with tears, and said, no, morten, do you believe that of me?
pretty marusya almost choked on her orange-scented handkerchief, and frau stöhr began to shriek, holding both hands to her left breast
too many troubles have rained down on me
his upper body swayed back and forth as he struggled for air in short, labored breaths through his half-open mouth, and kept rocking his head back and forth, as if he had been struck some incomprehensible blow
religious socialism, religiosity committed to social concerns, that was the thing, for it all depended on finding the right commitment, and the theonomous bond had to be joined to the social bond, to the task god had imposed on us to perfect society
although he had one of the best seats and could easily have read the passage from his book, he was too lazy even for that today
and it’s not just her—it’s the maids, too
consul johann buddenbrook’s younger son had recovered from his rheumatic fever in oeynhausen, but a certain stiffness lingered in his limbs, and he was certainly not free of the periodic ache in his left side—where all the nerves were too short—or of any other of the ailments to which he felt himself disposed: difficulties in breathing and swallowing, irregular pulse, and a tendency to paralysis, or at least the fear of it
i asked you to come up because—but, then, you know what this is about, and i know that you are in agreement with us

its nordic classical façade, painted a dreary, weather-beaten color, was adorned by pilasters at both sides of the front door, which was set in the center of the first floor and had five stairs leading up to it; the main level was topped off by two more stories, both with windows reaching to the floor and ornamented with wrought-iron grills
and had it been up to him, the city administration nowadays would look just as old-fashioned and idyllic as his office had looked when he was in his prime
but what concern is that of mine?
well, then, you can fall in, two by two, tomorrow
and so arzt has chosen socialism and carl teutleben nationalism
no doubt of it, totally anemic, just as i said

and although he did not spare herr settembrini, but let the italian worry that he found naphta’s malice worth listening to, he nevertheless had to admit that it was now out of control, indeed often went beyond the bounds of a sane, healthy mind
he had sat at all seven tables in the dining hall, spending approximately a year at each
the consul paged back and forth in the notebook
it was closed off at the far end by the portal, the summerhouse with its rococo façade
they, the schweigestills, she said, did not regularly let rooms out as a business, but only occasionally took in renters and boarders, on a case by case basis so to speak; the gentlemen could have concluded that right off from what she had told them that day, and whether he, the caller, represented such an instance, such a case, she would have to leave him to be the judge of that
it was at that same period, immediately after his mother’s demise, that sixteen-year-old leo made the acquaintance of father unterpertinger
it was all in italian, but he understood more or less what they sang—not every word, but enough here and there, given his knowledge of the plot and his sympathy for its situations, a personal empathy that had increased each time he played the four or five records, until it now became a genuine infatuation
madame de tolna was a rich widow, whose husband, a dissipated nobleman-he had, however, not succumbed to his vices but had died in a horseracing accident-had left her childless and the owner of a palace in pest and a huge estate several hours south of the capital, near szekesfehervar, between the danube and lake balaton, as well as a castlelike villa overlooking that same lake

they had no choice—ha!
it came as a great inspiration
the title, apocalipsis cum figuris, pays homage to diirer and is surely intended to emphasize the visual objectivization-including the graphically realized minutia and the density of a space filled with fantastically precise detail-shared by both works
and you … you won’t mock me if i tell you that …
they wanted their hands on these gentlemen’s throats, that was all
nepomuk's bed was surrounded by several people, with whom i shook hands, all the while directing my eyes toward the dying child
and he laid a hand on the young girl’s head, the way everyone liked to do
this was a recently acquired habit of moving the eyes rapidly back and forth (more or less equally to either side), to roll his eyes, as people say, at certain moments, when pondering something, for instance-which one could imagine might well alarm many people
and, raising her shoulders and directing her gaze heavenward, she added, grünlich!
and i am proud, you know, that you’ve taken me into your confidence first
he alternated between running one long finger inside his collar and letting both hands glide through his golden muttonchops
the role of the confidant is always simultaneously flattering and painful, since one plays it really only under the precondition that one is of no consequence oneself
there is no doubt she recalled her transient visitor from a year before
next to a metal-roofed arcade, open to the south and filled with lounge chairs, stood a flagpole, painted reddish brown and displaying a banner that fluttered full now and then—a fantasy flag, green and white, with a snake-entwined caduceus, the symbol of healing, at its center
ticipation in kridwiss's gatherings and the taxing ideas to which i deliberately exposed myself there, would not of themselves have caused my weight loss, not fourteen pounds, not half that many

and if the day should arrive when dye no longer sufficed, she would wear a wig of the same color as the hair of her youth
and what were they talking about?
it’s always that way, really
and what else but music, i thought, was by its very nature called to be the guide that leads us out of the sphere of absurd artificiality into open air, into the world of nature and humanity?
i went on, alone and misunderstood and with everyone calling me arrogant, but i said to myself, for better or for worse, till death do you part
fare thee well and much obliged!
they had barely grasped the fact that the age of localized war was past and that any campaign into which we saw ourselves forced had to end in a global conflagration
god knows, once he started running things, i simply threw up my hands
christian, however, had decided he needed a full vacation and complained of a vague pain in his left leg, which dr grabow had no idea how to treat, giving christian cause to describe his symptoms in that much greater detail
i’ve been mulling over the same thing in one form or another for the last few days
he did not choose words full of pathos, although it seemed to him at that moment as if an icy hand had gripped his heart, making it twitch and then hammer rapidly against his ribs, just as it had the day rhadamanthus first discovered the moist spot on his lung
vague, exaggerated rumors began to circulate about this unprofitable liquidation, and they were fed by reports that gerda buddenbrook was thinking of selling her grand home
and if you want to study them, you first learn classical languages as the basis, do you not?
on the other hand, it is clear what got consul hagenström thinking about buying it
do you know that you are visibly growing in stature right before my eyes?
i’ve noticed, of course, that you people up here never wear one
you did not ask me to wait, i waited quite on my own
he was permitted to woo her, gaze upon her, covet her-covet to make a christian wife of her, as we theologians say with justifiable pride at having smuggled the devil out of this union of the flesh by making a sacrament of it, the sacrament of christian marriage
it was obvious what had happened
will he wake up now?
there was thaw in the air
i felt much the same way about adrian's signature; indeed, my questions, cares, fears went well beyond it and, in the silence of my heart, were directed at the very legitimacy of his activity, at his temporal claim to the sphere in which he had immersed himself and whose re-creation he pursued with most highly developed, the uttermost, means
it is being done at present with the greatest brazenness, and that is the chief cause of my living in seclusion
and there’s a son, too, who was one or two years ahead of me in school and is at university, i think

he had two sons, peter and james—the one in the navy and seldom at home, the other an employee in the family wine business and the designated heir of the firm
mud-dy and stud-dy, all of which the little lad accompanied with explanatory gestures unlike any i have ever seen a child make-a vaguely expressive use of arms and playful hands, which although utterly charming often tended to make his meaning seem obscure and emgmauc
he was annoyed with himself for being in such bad shape, and with the leery self-consciousness of youth he detected traces of an indulgent smirk in the assistant director’s reassuring smile
i still had a whole stack of latin tests to correct for monday
the death of her second child was neither the last nor the hardest blow that she would have to bear
if he thought the main point was that we heard it-why, then, we shared this opinion completely
but i have endured it all—the trouble with grünlich and with permaneder and with weinschenk—and i never lost heart, tom
prosecutor paravant went so far as to don a black swallowtail coat with a dotted vest, and the ladies’ attire had a diaphanous and festive look
needless to say, in dealing in these pages with those two youthful years i spent in halle with my friend-their course interrupted by vacations in kaisersaschern and on his father's farm-i can only offer the same sort of foreshortened image in which his school days were reflected
a german writer could not very well call himself 'germany,  one christens a battleship with that at best
it even sticks its tactile apparatus out beyond itself—as hair, body hair, which is nothing but keratinized skin that can sense something approaching before the skin itself is touched

he married into our family, he’s one of us now, after all
the cousins learned about it from alfreda schildknecht, or sister berta as she was known, who tended poor fritz rotbein and stopped them in the corridor to inform them of the discreet event
the tone of his cry seemed to say, well, who could object to that!
as far as the actual work goes, i’m not sure how much progress you’ve made in your knowledge of commercial matters
he advised me to contain my excitement
the good man would not hear of migraine, since the often extreme headache was not confined to one side, as is the case with migraine, but was felt as a gnawing torment in and above both the eyes-and in any case was regarded by the physician as only a secondary symptom
faces numbed with cold, heads bare, but feet in rubber galoshes, they moved along the sidewalk, its deep layer of snow strewn with ashes and crunching underfoot, or plowed through looser mounds of snow in the road—settembrini in his winter coat, its beaver collar and lapels worn so smooth and hard that it had a rather mangy look, though he wore it elegantly all the same; naphta in a black, ankle-length coat that buttoned to the neck, fully lined with fur, but not so that anyone could see it
but this year the massive accumulation from so many snowfalls had seriously limited everyone’s movement in the open—except for skiers, of course
and it really is out of the question
i’ll ask some other time, when the opportunity presents itself; there’s no hurry, it really is none of my business, i’m merely curious
marriage, but also because she maintains an equivocal loyalty to her missing brother
i was sitting there reading a book, a travel book about south america
he was seen in town once before he left: a foppishly dressed young fellow with an unwholesome look about him
and so today it is now my turn
he had set up a kind of heinrich heine museum at home, a collection of papers and memorabilia, all of it related in some way to that brash and frail poet
he had never vacationed in the south, taken so much as a sip of it, knew only his own rough, pallid sea and clung to it with clumsy, childish emotion, but he had never reached the mediterranean—naples, sicily, greece
and then you must take my place
i n its conservative form, holding tight to revelation and traditional exegesis, it has attempted to save whatever elements of biblical religion could be saved; and on the other, liberal, side, theology has accepted the historical-critical methods of profane historical science and

you never expected, i hope, that i would bring home some young thing from the möllendorpf-langhals-kistenmaker-hagenström circle
as a six- or eight-year-old he did not call me serenus, or simply seren, just as i called him adri
they had to practice the sacred craft; the fundamentals of harmony and the strict style, for years before he allowed them to sing a song, and his musical pedagogy had not the least connection with little sweethearts
he was not feeling well
for all the while i had warmed to my topic, she had been looking across more at him than at me, exactly as if she were listening to him and not to me-though, to be sure, his expression constantly mocked my excitement with an enigmatic smile that was certainly a long way from confirming me as his representative
he lay on his back in the deep silence of the slightly oppressive sultry night air, and stared up at the ceiling
the most important matters still lie ahead of us, my good wenzel
thomas asked in annoyance
it’s simply too absurd, too unthinkable, too— she could say no more and held both hands to her temples
let me tell you
simply that the hour-glass has been turned, that the sand has begun to run-about that would i come to an understanding with you, dear boy
space, like time, gives birth to forgetfulness, but does so by removing an individual from all relationships and placing him in a free and pristine state—indeed, in but a moment it can turn a pedant and philistine into something like a vagabond
in the meantime we have experienced the destruction of our venerable cities from the air-an act that would scream to the heavens were not we who suffer it ourselves laden with guilt
she found it as she was preparing for bed, read it, and marched with a firm stride downstairs to madame buddenbrook’s bedroom on the mezzanine, where, without the least embarrassment, she read the cleric’s epistle in a loud voice
certainly, hans castorp said, i’m certain i shall
two medallions were pinned at either side of the décolletage of her ball gown; she had arms like sticks and a voice whose unique toneless quality sadly revealed the reason why she resided up here
mynheer peeperkorn could be seen moving about—one could not avoid seeing him, for that majestic head towered above its surroundings, overwhelming everything with royal vigor and import
at the time, kretzschmar was working on his own piece for the stage, the marble statue, and he also gave particella scores of one scene or another to his apprentice to orchestrate and then showed him how he himself had done it, or was intending to do it-resulting in numerous debates, during which, it goes without saying, the master's considerably greater experience usually held the field, though on at least one occasion the novice's intuition triumphed
when james möllendorpf’s death was discussed at the buddenbrook family dinner on thursday, frau permaneder first expressed her regrets several times, but then she began to let the tip of her tongue play along her upper lip and cast her brother a sly look—which caused the ladies buddenbrook to exchange indescribably knowing glances, and then, simultaneously, as if on command, they closed their eyes and mouths firmly for one long second
he performed these little services when he would drop by on his way to the dining hall or after a walk, telling joachim to go on ahead, that he was just going to check quickly on the case in room ; and each time he felt his whole being expand with a joy rooted in a sense of helpfulness and quiet importance, but intermingled with a certain jaunty delight in the spotless christian impression his good deeds made—an impression so devout, caring, and praiseworthy, in fact, that no serious objections whatever could be raised against it, either from a military or a humanistic-pedagogic standpoint
i’ll take it with me to amsterdam
then frau schwarzkopf bustled about and made coffee, and they had an evening snack on the porch just as in the old days—except that they were all a good ten years older now and that morten was not there, nor little meta, who had married the chief magistrate of the town of haffkrug; except that the pilot, rather deaf and very white-haired now, had retired; except that the hair in his wife’s hairnet was all gray, too; except that madame grünlich was no longer a silly goose, but had learned something about life—which did not prevent her from helping herself to the honeycomb and remarking, that’s a pure product of nature
madame buddenbrook had been informed of this; and that same evening, she joined herr permaneder, antonie, and thomas in the landscape room for a discussion in which all questions were resolved without difficulty—even those concerning little erika
oh, i want to show it all to you
but when his patient-who was not at all ill, his general health being in no way affected-returned for his appointment
the köppens walked beside consul kröger and his family in the direction of the river, while senator langhals, dr grabow, and jean jacques hoffstede moved off in the opposite direction
good god in heaven, do you know how that sounds?
the thunder's twofold cry of jehovah!
what happened is as follows
adrian himself would surely never-in, let us say, a symphony-have announced such a theme so prematurely, would at most have let it insinuate itself from afar in some subtly concealed and almost impalpable fashion
my cousin, whom i came here to visit, was a military man, an honest and good fellow, but that did not help him—he died here, leaving me behind, and here i am still
nothing, of course, ever became paralyzed
do you know the artist’s name?
he had many obligations and urgent flirtations in the ballroom, but it would not have seemed very nice to him to completely neglect the ladies from ramberg strasse, with whom his relationship was more of the fraternal sort
but it’s not an intermittent fever

it had an especially well cured wrapper and was named oath of rütli; somewhat stubbier than maria, mouse gray in color with a bluish band, it was very tractable and mild by nature; it had a snow-white durable ash that still showed the veins of the wrapper
you’re the mayor’s right hand—my god, can’t the senate just pardon him on the spot?
her chief and most constant annoyance, however, was the religiosity that pervaded her parents’ spacious house—because with each added year and each new ailment the consul’s pious leanings grew increasingly more fervent, and his wife, too, was developing a taste for such things as she grew older
to his greater glory, he beshits his way into art
they said, the senator replied, patting her hand until the coughing fit was over, they said that our dear mother would be back on her feet again in a few days
you’re fond of your cousin, aren’t you, hans castorp?
both here and on the way back downstairs, they began to talk about arrangements for the guest's comfort and daily regimen, continuing and then settling the matter below in the abbot's study, that patriarchal room so rich in character, of which adrian had long since taken emotional possession: a large jug of hot water in the morning, strong coffee
and at every step of the way along this hall connecting the two sets of stairs, there was a chance that one particular door might open at any moment—and so it did, on repeated occasions, slamming shut behind frau chauchat, who would emerge soundlessly and glide soundlessly toward the stairs
but the local custom of discretion had meant that he learned of karen’s demise too late and that she had already been placed in a permanent horizontal position, in the garden of the cupid whose snowy cap was cocked to one side
her flushed, downy spinster’s cheeks suggested a temperature above normal, and her titillating remarks stirred hans castorp’s blood
why, you might discover a jellyfish in it any second
the woman in the paper tricorn looked him up and down—and her smile betrayed neither pity nor concern for his ravaged condition
this is rosenheim from utrecht, he said, pointing to the test tube with his cigar
old-fashioned, ornate round-hand, a monkish hand one might say
i have spoken of adrian's inner cosmopolitanism before
some people are rich, yes, he answered now, and some are not
play no infirmities with me, please!
slowly, with lowered head, he strode across the polished floor of the spacious room and sat down on one of the dark-red sofas by the window at the far end
in his deteriorated mental state, he rented a room, a chamber, little more than a hole on some disreputable street—on kleine gröpel grube, on engelswisch or an der mauer—and then slunk into his hideaway to eat his pastries
the work of the religious orders was not an end in itself, that is, a narcotic
that’s if your wife is agreed
we all have good reason to court herr permaneder a bit
no, when it came to the ultimate and highest questions, there was no help from outside—no mediation, no absolution, no soothing consolation
he commanded with a severity attributable to his own nervous tension
not in any way
and then we’ll have—six glasses of milk and one mug of beer, if i’m not mistaken, herr permaneder?
according to dr langhals, who had completely taken over dr grabow’s practice and was now the buddenbrooks’ family physician, there was a definite reason for hanno’s unsatisfactory health and pallor: the boy’s body unfortunately did not produce a sufficient quantity of red corpuscles, so essential for good health
but the sweet, exalted splendor of what he had heard lifted him up and away from all that
that is terribly relevant—pardon me, sir—i mean, you are so colossally right about that, because we are not dealing with two totally different viewpoints and relationships, but, more precisely, with the same one in both instances, with mere variations on a theme
i am, moreover, in possession of papers, of priceless manuscripts, which the deceased bequeathed to me, and 'to no one else, in a will written during a period of health or, if i may not put it that way, during a period of comparative and legal sanity, papers i shall use to document my presentation-indeed, i plan to select certain of them for
bonsoir, la lune! '
but when he repeated and harmonized it high in the treble, in tone colors like frosted silver, its essence was revealed to be a simple resolution, a yearning, painful descent from one key to another—a short-winded, paltry invention, which gained its strange, mysterious, momentous quality from the pretentious, resolute solemnity of its definition and presentation
her brother the consul picked her up at the train station—she had come by way of büchen—and the moment they drove into town through the holsten gate he could not resist complimenting her by saying that she was still the fairest in the family, except for klothilde
and while herr settembrini hid his face in both hands—revealing very shabby leather gloves—naphta asked in a chill, statesmanlike voice how else intractable criminals should be handled if not with stocks and cudgels, which were very stylish furnishings for a prison in any case
still standing, dr mantelsack now crossed his ankles and paged through his notebook
might make him more suitable, make his task that much easier for him ?
he would not have let any of you talk him out of it
inez basically despised the lust for beauty felt by this city that reveled in the senses and to which her mother's curiosity about greater freedom in matters of morality had transplanted her; but for the sake of her bourgeois station she took part in the festivities of a society that was one grand art association-and that proved dangerous to the very peace she sought
and so began tony buddenbrook’s third marriage—and that was indeed the appropriate term for it
oh, what all haven’t i seen in these last few days
his playing was clean and cultivated-the tone was not large, but fell sweetly on the ear, and the technique more than a little brilliant
i hope that you clearly understand the matter now, dear bethsy?
you women don’t usually moralize like that for no good reason
if they understood him correctly, the consumption of tobacco was, in his opinion, one of those over-refined pleasures, the cultivation of which meant robbing the simpler gifts of life of their majesty—gifts and claims to which our emotional vigor scarcely did justice as it was

herr modersohn turned ash-gray and dragged his professorial chair down from the platform, all the while dusting it with his handkerchief
but it is constantly being split up
the brokers sat down with the wholesalers
i am speaking of the second half of the eighteenth century, which settembrini would not hesitate to describe to you as a period of decline in his guild
eduard kistenmaker, who received the least number of votes, has been dropped from the next ballot

when he came home on vacations—very neat, very well dressed, sporting a little reddish-blond moustache in the middle of his sleepy, young, patrician face, looking for all the world like a young man on his way to a respectable place in life—the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community, who kept themselves well informed about various families and the staffing of municipal offices (and that means most people in a self-governing city-state), his fellow citizens, then, looked him over and asked themselves what public role young castorp might one day grow into
the insights he had gained over time into their lives and doings, their customs and opinions, were not very conducive to such good intentions
and what atmosphere is that?
yes, just look at the world’s colorful variety
yes, good lord, christian!
future, lads will swear by your name, who thanks to your madness will no longer need to be mad
from behind some shrubs came the muted, heavy rhythms of a dirge
seen from this angle, he suggested, it was a stroke of fortune, a happy turn of fate, that he had chanced to come up here and had occasion to be examined; because otherwise he would probably have remained unaware of his condition much longer and perhaps have learned of it in a much more distressing fashion
was hans castorp still one of life’s problem children in herr settembrini’s eyes?
director stoientin, however, had used the goethe quote much more in the spirit of schiller, for whom everything was a matter of freedom, and who therefore made a moral distinction between talent and personal merit, sharply separating merit and good fortune, which goethe saw as inextricably interwoven
this becomes even clearer and is still more forcefully elaborated in the scene with the good old physician
what are you crying about?
his teeth were not very good, were small and yellowish
she might have left the berghof, he thought—that is, if he gave any thought at all to her disappearance
we dare not, we cannot, do the same
the undersigned makes bold, dearest demoiselle, deferentially to send you this little ring, enclosed as a pledge of his undying tenderness
for the sake of inner continuity, he said to himself, it would be better to bring a remnant of the project belonging to the old conditions along into the new and to cast his inner eye on some new project only when the new externals had become routine
don’t hold it against me, clavdia
the car was full, two gentlemen were even hanging on to straps and standing in the aisle by the rear door
the low level of musical interest that herr pfühl knew existed below him in the nave, among the families of senators, consuls, and other solid citizens, was a source of constant sorrow, and that was the real reason he liked to have his young pupil beside him—at least he could call his attention to the extraordinary difficulty of the piece he had just played
he’s been thinking about it all day and all night
then he said in an oddly faltering, equivocal voice, no, i did not know about that
and what should one say to such an attack on human reason?
this past spring the league was called together in solemn convention in barcelona
you’ve kept the coffee warm for me, frau schwarzkopf
let’s hope your last week will be better
good god, rudolf, if only you would not put on that beaming face of the rescuer the moment you arrive!
but one thing more, my dear senator—we shan’t let certain symptoms unnerve us, shall we?
his purposes, then, were purely emotional—or so said slanderous tongues, of which there is never a lack
above all the league endeavors to supply materials to progressive political parties everywhere
every word you’ve said is childish
he suddenly cried, throwing his hands behind his head and then shoving them forward, as if to ward off the whole world
with the death of johann buddenbrook, normal social life had also died on meng strasse, and apart from the visit of an occasional clergyman elisabeth entertained no guests other than the members of her family, who gathered on thursday evenings
it would be the same as if someone took the harebrained notion of holding a single note or chord for hours on end—and called it music
and why shouldn’t they, really?
but in any case, it was high time, and then some, for him to come up here
he charmed and captivated them with stories that flowed in an effortless stream, spoken in a slightly plaintive, languid voice and delivered in the harmlessly risqué fashion of an english comedian
such a reading, played by the orchestre de ia suisse romande, was being held in geneva more or less concurrently with the concert in basel, and wendell kretzschmar had used his connections and succeeded in having adrian's phosphorescence of the sea (a work, by way of exception, of a young german) included in the program
now there’s a real question for you!
which was why the model crematorium and its hall of urns, the hall of death as such, had been planned with an adjoining hall of life, where architecture, painting, sculpture, music, and poetry would be united, so that the mind of the survivor might be directed away from the experience of death, from dull mourning and idle laments, toward the good things of life
it is only a step from such a question, as well as from the locutions of wise solomon, to maimonides, the ostensibly greatest rabbi of the middle ages, but in truth an assimilator of aristotle, who manages to
did settembrini know what was going on with him?
but firstly and lastly, and this justification has always carried the greatest validity, if not before man, then before god: i loved him-with terror and tenderness, with indulgence and doting admiration, seldom asking whether he in any way returned my feelings
she had loosened her hands from the back of her neck, and her arms—she spread them wide now, revealing the inner surface, especially the tender skin at the elbow with its blood vessels, two large bluish branching veins—her arms were of inexpressible sweetness
but they simply melt together for euphoria
we spoke about the neutrality and intellectual hesitancy of youth, of its freedom to choose, its tendency to experiment with all sorts of standpoints, and of how one need not regard such experiments as final, life-determining options
dusk glowed in the sky beyond the river—delicate, pure, pale, like something painted on fine china
i can admit to you now that i haven’t liked your looks from the start, not since the first time i had the undeserved honor of making your acquaintance—and was pretty sure of my guess that you were secretly one of the locals, and would finally come to appreciate the fact yourself, as has many a man before you, who came up here just for the fun of it, looked around with his nose in the air, and one fine day discovered he would do well—indeed, mark my words, would do more than well—to remain on here, for reasons having nothing to do with the seductions of mere curiosity, for a rather more extended stay
here once again there were scattered snorts of laughter, but there were also several people who clicked their tongues, and shook their heads, too, as if at some tactless indiscretion, and some eyes took on a darkly probing look
but why from a deep cellar’?
hanno buddenbrook was almost the only student whom herr modersohn knew by name, and he used that knowledge against him—constantly calling him to order, assigning him extra homework as punishment, and tyrannizing him in general
his fur coat was splattered with muck and slush
yes, it’s in the rules
but he felt very dizzy from lying there so long, and the unrefreshing semisleep had left his face badly flushed again, although his body felt chilled all over—perhaps he had not been covered warmly enough
now, start again, please—the shepherd’s sunday song
but i cannot join you in your radicalism-which as the license of students, by the way, wo not last long-in your kierkegaardian separation of church and christianity
it’s fat, the director said with finality as he closed a cupboard from which he had extracted the utensils for brewing coffee: a cylindrical turkish mill, a long-handled pot, a divided bowl for sugar and ground coffee—all of brass
he did not belong to the circle of rich merchants, did not dine at their tables or visit back and forth with them
herr settembrini was a humanitarian, and yet at the same time and bound up with it, he was, as he half admitted, a man of war
tossing his head back and forth on his pillow, he went on now in a soft, plaintive voice:
so how did you like him?
the season was definitely over
hans castorp felt only disdain for the lad’s allowing himself to be repulsed, and he let his disdain be known with a shrug
i shall not ask, but shall calculate the possibilities, give frank consideration to them all, even the most extraordinary
it often happens with pneumonia
so distorted that they could inspire fear, his eyes listening and filled with mad abstraction, he had stared at them, looking as if he had just come from a life-and-death struggle with all the hostile spirits of counterpoint
you must be suffering a great deal
but with a kind of alarm at himself he saw that if he were to make this discipline his
no one can say that he broke his promise
and, as always when they were in travemünde, consul buddenbrook joined tony for a visit with the old schwarzkopfs on front row
on the fourth day he succeeded
of his faustthere remains, however, the human, the instinctive desire, if not for assistance, then at least for the company of one's fellow human beings, the plea: forsake me not!
the fish course was passed, and as pastor wunderlich carefully served himself he said, a happy present is not something we can always take for granted
and although tony had told him the story of her marriage in some detail when she was visiting the niederpaurs in munich, he queried her once again about the whole affair, squinting in anxious sympathy and inquiring in particular about the specifics of the bankruptcy
don’t you see, ida?
it had, in fact, as one could clearly see, impressed and occupied his young receptive mind more than anything else he heard
during each hour of his segmented day, he had thought of her mouth, her cheekbones, her eyes—whose color, shape, and placement cut deep into his soul—of her limp back, the way she carried her head, the neck bones above the collar line of her blouse, her arms a radiant illusion under flimsiest gossamer
and what else was there, or better, what wasn’t there?
whom should i have asked ?
you shall tweak the nose of your prince of shades up there
as might have been expected, frau permaneder also had her objections to the sale of the house her brother had built
one must be fair
herr brecht quivered with the exertion, and thomas buddenbrook could feel the tremor pass through his whole body; he was pulled up out of his chair a little and heard a soft squeak coming from somewhere deep in the dentist’s throat
but hugo was and remained a missing person
this soft, ghostly pantomime was extremely entertaining
i must return to camp, to quarters, for roll call, he cries in despair at an ingenuousness that only doubles the burden his heart already feels
settembrini looked at him wide-eyed
but it had to be warm, warm in his study, otherwise he would shiver and could weep tears of rage if anyone allowed him to freeze
granted, he could not help hanno with his lessons—given his untamed, free-ranging spirit, he felt the same loathing for multiplication tables as dreamy, distracted young buddenbrook did
but hans castorp replied that he wanted to own them himself—it was different reading a book that you owned
and bach himself, good lord, they accused him of being dissonant and muddy
he had been flabbergasted to hear that there really and truly was such a thing; and he had diligently sounded the terrorist out on the beginnings and character of this curious institution, which in a few years would celebrate its two-hundredth anniversary
he limited himself to objecting to herr settembrini’s critique of hermine kleefeld, which seemed unjust to him—or which, for other reasons, he wanted to see as unjust
and here i feel constrained to mention the following: the framework of landscape and house where adrian later established his life as a mature man-that is, when he settled for good with the schweigestills in pfeiffering near waldshut in upper bavaria-very strangely resembled, even replicated, the framework of his childhood; or put another way, the setting of his later years curiously imitated that of his youth
a few times hans castorp saw him climbing the stairs or standing in the corridor talking with krokowski, the head nurse, or another patient; he would watch and wait to buttonhole him
hans castorp’s face showed his indifference as he reviewed them in his mind
my duties required that i return to kaisersaschern that same evening

old siegismund gosch the broker was sitting out on the glass veranda, drinking his rum grog
and pulling himself up straight and regaining his serene dignity, he spoke about modern, progressive forms of humanitarian nursing, the slow, steady victory over epidemic disease, and went on to contrast such horrors with the achievements of medical science, hygiene, and social reforms
a jurisprudence that wished to base itself in popular sentiment and not isolate itself from
adventures in the flesh and spirit, which enhanced and heightened your ordinariness, allowed you to survive in the spirit what you probably will not survive in the flesh
yes, yes, gentlemen, the damn libido, he said
can one use what tradition offers, can one sanctify old artifices with more genius ?
he would spot him standing among the other guests in the game room of an evening, gazing gloomily and forlornly at the charming, though flawed woman who was sitting on the sofa in the small salon and chatting with frizzy-haired tamara (that was the droll-looking girl’s name), dr blumenkohl, the man with the concave chest, and the hunch-shouldered youths from her table
she had been giving serious attention to what her brother was saying
and he looked down at the inert figure that lay stretched out before him, so stern and solemn among all that white satin
small and near, or large and distant?
it was yellow, ragged, deeply furrowed

the restaurant was well lit, elegant, and comfortable
it entered soundlessly through the window, bounced soundlessly against the heavy padding of furs on lebrecht kröger’s chest, rolled just as soundlessly to the soft blanket on his knees, and finally came to rest on the floor
they are pains that one gladly and proudly takes in the bargain with pleasures so enormous, pains such as one knows from a fairy tale, pains like slashing knives, like those the little mermaid felt in the beautiful human legs she had acquired for a tail
i exchanged greetings with dr kranich, who was sitting on schwerdtfeger's side, but much farther back by the rear door
the pregnancy of i   appeared to increase her vitality rather than to impair it

and he who will have the devil can not be frustrated, nor can he defend gainst him, and it was but a little step from the divine faculty over to leipzig and to music, such that i did devote myself solely and entirely to figuris, characteribus, formis coniurationum, and whatsoever other names such evocation and magic be named

the gaze he directed to me as i approached had something vehement and distraught about it and then, to my sorrow, quickly veiled itself in gloomy animosity
which means that they make an incision here, somewhere along the side here—i don’t know precisely where they cut, but behrens has it down perfectly
there is no one else, far and wide
you have not the least understanding, you city folk, and there's need of understanding here
to be sure, she recovered only slowly from the delivery, and those troublesome fevers that had led to a stay in the sanatorium ten years previous flared up again
and little antonie, a petite eight-year-old in a dress of softly shimmering silk, was thinking hard, her pretty blond head turned slightly toward her grandfather, but her gray-blue eyes directed into the room without seeing anything
and then the uncanny sixteen lines of poison tree, in which the poet waters his wrath with tears, suns it with smiles and deceitful wiles, until its tree bears a bright apple that poisons the friend who steals it-and whom the hater is glad to see lying dead beneath the tree the next morning

the only ornamentation was an embossed wreath of roses and serrated leaves around its rim
this, however, would have contradicted his nature as creator, and therefore he had created the world as it is, that is, interlarded with evil-that is, it had to be yielded up in part to demonic influences
what he could at best have without us in time's old classic courses, only we can offer now-a-days
the eyes lay deep in their sockets, the brows had grown bushier, and from under them the specter directed
the merchant’s insignificant presence greatly reduced the worries he had about the possible appearance of natives of hamburg
that presence could not deny the inevitability of growth, but it found refuge in a conceptual sphere that is mythic and timeless, where all things are simultaneous and abide in parallel, where the male figure of the man is no contradiction to the babe in its mother's arms-which he likewise is, always is, forever raising his little hand in the sign of the cross to adoring saints
you take off your hat and tiptoe past his presence, rocking your way forward
what frau stöhr in her ignorance did to the phrase dulci jubilo was quite extraordinary; she pronounced the first word as dolce, borrowing it from the italian musical vocabulary of her spouse, but the second was more reminiscent of yippee-ay-oh or god only knew what—and at the sound of her latin, the two cousins simultaneously made a grab for the straws in their glasses
it’s hailing, someone said in a loud, clear voice
real time knows no turning points, there are no thunderstorms or trumpet fanfares at the start of a new month or year, and even when a new century commences only we human beings fire cannon and ring bells
herr modersohn blinked again, looked around, pulled a peevish face, and gazed back at his attendance book, running his little, clumsy hand down to the name he now decided to call

don’t give up, holger, just let it come, you’ll do it!

his tiny hands play with the gold braid on his nurse’s bodice, and his head, covered by a pale blue lace-trimmed bonnet, lies turned slightly to one side on the pillow; his eyes pay no attention to the pastor, but peer instead out into the room full of relatives—blinking, inspecting, almost precocious eyes, with very long lashes and irises whose lustrous, vague golden brown hovers between the pale blue of his father’s and the brown of his mother’s, depending on the light
paris, antwerp, venice, copenhagen
but i am very pleased that she holds to the faith of her fathers and detests such unevangelical gimcrackery
i remember, however, that deutschlin now led a rather long and not at all uninteresting debate about creativity, a discussion of how it was subject to the limitations of all sorts of preconditions, to culture, tradition, imitation, convention, routine, although, in the end, not without human creativity's having been regarded as coming from on high-as a distant reflection of the power of divine being, as an echo of the almighty summons into existence-and productive imagination's having been given theological recognition after all
no, no, everything must be clean and out in the open
oh, it’s a conspiracy between stupidity and wickedness!
he now asked them to send the things he needed
it is only to his credit that he has not yet written any music, has not yet revealed a productive impulse by naively launching into youthful compositions
the former is intellectual monkishness, a iearned refinement that profoundly despises life and nature, which indeed sees barbarism in life and nature, in immediacy, humanity, feeling
there was nothing to be seen everywhere, absolutely nothing except a few very small snowflakes descending from the white above to the white below, and the silence all around took its power from what it did not say
tion room was decorated with charming chinese works in ink and watercolor (from the sung dynasty!
as you’ve surely noticed, i barely speak french
opposite the windows, ranks of seats rose to form an amphitheater, at the bottom of which stood a table, covered by a green cloth and furnished with a large bell, documents, and writing utensils for the chairman, recording clerk, and whatever members of the senate delegation might be present
she even lost weight—and the glow in her cheeks
herr naphta would be pleased to receive the gentlemen, he reported, and asked them to follow; he opened another door, two or three steps farther on the right, behind which was a heavy portiere that he also lifted aside for the young men to enter
edhin krokowski’s lectures had taken an unexpected turn after all these little years
from time to time he would return to the quartet and its third movement-that alien air, that lunar landscape-and the enormous difficulty of performing it
i think i can promise that he will sleep a lot toward the last and dream pleasant dreams, and if at the very end he is unable to sleep, his passing will nevertheless be swift, imperceptible—it won’t even matter much to him, you can be sure of that
it was not my impression that inez particularly cared about other people's knowing
he fell silent, but as he chewed, he would glance now and then at tony and tom, checking them over
i prefer not to speak of a lack of naivete on his part, for ultimately naivete is the basis of being itself, of all being, of even the most self-aware and complicated
humanist—certainly i am that
she had turned to address joachim, despite the magazine he was holding up in front of his face—because he was a long-term resident, of course, and so she had known him longer, at least by sight
by now he was availing himself of every possible means of protection against the cold, the whole paraphernalia
the crowd, however, was not much larger than the group assembled in the hall and consisted of young workers from the docks and warehouses, porters, schoolchildren, a few sailors from merchant ships—men and boys who lived in the alleys, lanes, mews, and courts of the less prosperous parts of town
adieu, my agent for champagne and cognac, she said
the idea of death doesn’t frighten me
anton, lina, trina, and sophie said their goodbyes to madam grünlich
my first didn’t turn out all that well
what he had learned was that x noppe & co was a smallish but quite solid firm, which, in conjunction with the joint-stock brewery headed by herr niederpaur, turned a tidy profit, and that herr permaneder’s share, together with tony’s seventeen thousand thalers courant, would be sufficient for them to live a respectable life together, although it would be without luxury
we walk and walk—how long has it been now?
those were the schneidewein progeny who had come into the world by then: rosa, ezechiel, and raimund
several guests were already seated in the room, tattered illustrated magazines spread over their knees
he even briefly considered whether he ought not to buy a sleeping bag, but backed off from that—indeed felt somewhat frightened by the idea
for included in his lessons was knowledge of the size of the register of each instrument in the orchestra (information the foster-child of an instrument dealer scarcely needed, by the way); and kretzschmar had begun giving him assignments to orchestrate short pieces from the classical period or a movement from a piano piece by schubert or beethoven and also to provide instrumentation for the piano accompaniment to songs-exercises whose weaknesses and errors he would then point out to adrian and correct
when, more out of love of truth than of self, one sets right the rudest misconceivings about oneself, one is a vapourer
tell us now, this very afternoon, director behrens
i’m talking nonsense, i know, but i would rather babble away and at least partially express something difficult than reproduce impeccable clichés
renowned scholars and experts from all over europe—medical doctors, economists, psychologists—will participate in drafting this encyclopedia, and the general editorial offices in lugano will act as the reservoir into which all articles will flow
if the director, who was nearing forty and whose hair was already flecked with gray, wished to establish a family, something quite appropriate to his position and means, the connection with erika grünlich would provide him an opening into one of the first families in town, securing him in his job and advancing his career
and then his uncle said, pardon me!
at one time, when the competition in that trade was still relatively small (though in the meantime it has grown considerably), i also occupied myself with the same idea and, as time and opportunity permitted, made some experiments in that regard

but the really beautiful thing is how it proved not to be
only where there is no spirit are we respectable
the white smock emphasized the director’s height; and if you took into account the arched neck and pictured him instead pulled up to full height, he seemed a man almost larger than life, topped by a small, colorful head with very peculiar features
and in certain respects, that is not good
she also led her guests upstairs, to the second floor, to show them a couple of the numerous
contrary to what you say, your system looks to me as if it's more apt to resolve human reason into magic
it is a long trip, however, from hamburg to those elevations—too long, really, for so short a visit
the story came to him on various occasions, in fragments and as connected narratives, and not only did he himself consider it highly remarkable, but he encouraged ferge and wehsal to do so as well, which they did—the former, of course, with a qualifying reminder that all higher things were foreign to him (for only the experience of pleural shock had ever lifted him above life’s most unpretentious levels); the latter, however, with obvious pleasure in the happy course an oppressed man’s life had taken, even though—since all good things must come to an end—it was now at a standstill and appeared to be foundering in their common malady
the director loved imported cigars and would have most preferred to smoke heavy havanas
the hapless woman warned the man who desired her against herself-and that means an act of the soul freely elevating itself above her pitiful physical existence, a humane act of distancing herself from it, an act of compassion, an act, if i may be permitted the word, of love
he quoted: awake, psaltery and harp!
you will ask your cousin giacomo—herr settembrini had fallen into the habit of calling joachim giacomo—you will ask your cousin giacomo to step out in front of your silence
it was quiet, they could even hear naphta’s teeth gnashing
people had dressed for dinner, the gentlemen in evening clothes, the ladies in jewels, some of them probably sent up from the plains below by loving husbands
the holidays proved incapable of disturbing the daily schedule of the residents of the berghof
settembrini flung an arm in the air
behrens discharged me once in a fit of temper
faustus to the companions of his final hour that they should go to bed, sleep in peace, and be not troubled
there was the sad documentation of gotthold’s letters to his father, and finally, cheerfully capping it all, the latest festive poem by jean jacques hoffstede

he said and, now rescued, took a sip of water and departed
moreover, love for such an object is itself equally significant
the beam of white light emitted by a few larger ones, in fact, was so intense that it blinded the eyes of their observers
a loose-fitting bodice of soft dark silk, with satin lapels and shoulders trimmed in lace, made her breast look enchantingly soft
christian is probably not going to amount to much, and i’m finished
an hour later, however, when he was presumed to be asleep, he escaped from the house without anyone's noticing, and gereon and a farm hand caught up with him at klammer pool only after he had already removed his outer clothing and stood submerged up to his neck in
this is the sign for the other guests to say their goodbyes as well, because gerda buddenbrook needs her rest
and she took the thermometer out of his hand, thrusting it at the air several times and driving the mercury down even further, below ninety-five degrees
that much is rather clear to me
my child, he said, —fine
hanno and i can’t hold this much longer
dressed in a little frock so richly trimmed with satin bows that it obviously reflected frau permaneder’s taste, the child was sitting on her nurse’s lap, her thumbs tightly clenched in her tiny fists and her slightly bulging eyes fixed straight ahead; she sucked on her tongue and occasionally let out a squeak, and then the nurse would rock her a bit
we can’t all be the same
the destiny that had brooded over europe for so long was unleashed, and, disguised as a disciplined implementation of all contingency plans and training, it raced through our cities, raging in all the minds and hearts of men as terror, exaltation, and frenzied urgency, as the thrill of fate, the sense of power, the readiness to sacrifice
you can’t imagine what a funny old man he is!
twice during the winter they were invited to the home of a patroness of art and artists, a lady of undetermined origins: madame de coniar, to whom rudiger schildknapp had a letter of introduction from friends in munich
before tony buddenbrook left her parents’ house for good, they had no choice but to gather here, one and all, to extend their sympathetic respects—despite grünlich, despite permaneder, despite hugo weinschenk
i heard him speak those words, along with the next two lines, why then do i madly long
there was a babel of voices
i won’t stand for it!
oh, of course, he’ll buy it, the whole thing, she said—making use of the throaty voice again
it divides them up and gives some content to each, so that there’s something to them after all—whereas normally the hours and days and weeks hang so awfully heavy on one’s hands
but that in no way lessened the present, dynamic temptation, which claimed the prerogative of individuality, refusing to be relegated to the familiar and general or to be mirrored in such descriptions, and which declared itself unique and incomparably urgent—without, of course, being able to deny that it was a temptation whispered from one particular corner, the promptings of a creature in spanish black with a snow-white, pleated ruff; and bound up with the idea and image were all sorts of gloomy, caustically jesuitical, and misanthropic notions, the torture and corporal punishment that were such abominations to herr settembrini, who with his barrel organ and ragione could only appear ridiculous in his opposition to them
at the time dr wulicke was called to the position, he had been a professor at a prussian secondary school
you enjoy watching a play, too, and you once told me, just between us, that you had your little affairs, and there was a time when you preferred reading novels and poems and such

he pulled up the blind, loosened the white-enameled hook, and opened the casement, watching the fly as it sped off across the gravel paths and rose beds of the garden
hans castorp gazed steadily at his profile
at the double desk beside the window sat dr krokowski, looking pale against his shiny black smock—elbows propped on the desktop, a pen in one hand, the other buried in his beard

you will conduct the phosphorescence, selections from love's labour's lost, your symphonie cosmologique
but at the same time he was touched, indeed jolted, by a confused feeling born of his own confusion in hearing a sweet young thing, whose hand he was holding, whisper the word yes in his ear
at last you cast courtesies aside and turn familiar, as is only proper between people who strike a compact and find agreement for time and eternity
the lady as she lives and breathes, hans castorp lied, less out of cunning than out of an awareness that if everything had been as it should be, he ought not to have recognized the lady at all, any more than joachim had recognized her on his own—dear old outfoxed joachim, for whom a light now went on, the real light and not the false one hans castorp had lit for him
you are too great for that
and as settembrini released the word from his lips, he thrust his small yellow right hand into the air, as if proposing a toast
and now there followed a very few softly spoken words that constituted their engagement and gave herr permaneder permission to speak to elisabeth and thomas once they had returned home
and turning on his heels, he pulled hans castorp out of the lobby and into the social room nearest the main entrance, which was set up for reading and writing, but was empty at the moment
their conversation had proceeded rather slowly, because hans castorp’s french was clumsy and he spoke haltingly as he tried to express himself
into the depths, herr settembrini?
the people, kai said fiercely
the heavy uneasiness of an overfilled stomach blended with the sweet excitement of the evening to create a sense of melancholy bliss

but i also would not have it be forgotten that it all began with his hovering about the drop, a word that indeed does not fit badly, since the earth consists primarily of water, of the water of its seas, which did escape the almighty's hand
but since time immemorial, the human striving for feeling has in fact had one means ready at hand, one drug, one intoxicant, that belongs to the classic gifts of life and bears the stamp of the simple and holy, and thus is no vice—one means of stature, if i may put it that way
her older sister, madame kethelsen, however, was called nelly
because i really believe that he and noppe have done very well for themselves with the niederpaurs’ brewery

the family kept the gruesome details of his death secret as best they could; but the story spread quickly through town and became the chief topic of conversation on the exchange, at the club, at the harmony, in offices, at town-council meetings, and at parties and balls
to which she replied, yes, herr permaneder, i believe you are
passing his hand across his brow, his eyes wandering about the room, he said, this is awful
under the senator’s supervision, the vault had been tidied up a bit and the remains of older buddenbrooks pushed aside

at first they convinced themselves that he was crying; but that was not the case
he stopped and looked about him
he opened his eyes wide, confused by the depth of his trance
gerda asked, and yawned, releasing a dainty, casual sigh, but covering her mouth with her hand mirror
it is, in its own way, a marvelous melodic find, a swelling cantilena that numbs the mind as one is carried away on its wide sweeping arc and that has something decidedly showy, boastful about it, but also a melancholy that is not without its charm if the violinist is so inclined
was that why he had got himself tangled up in this brazen analysis of vice?
a new connection like that between the baltic and north seas
i never loved him
he made a long, kind face, shook hands with everyone, regarded the patient, shook his head, and proceeded to do exactly what dr langhals had done
twenty-five years ago, we were wise enough to prevent it at the very last moment, but our increasingly tragically heroic state of mind apparently will no longer allow us to forsake a lost cause before the unthinkable becomes reality
well, that’s fine, ziemssen, he said
in tones now swelling, now fading away, he praised the qualities of the dear departed—her elegance and humility, her cheerfulness and piety, her charity and gentleness
but apparently, given his adaptations and permutations, he was not as loyal as joachim was to his—although, to be sure, whenever hans castorp, both as a civilian and child of peace, listened to this has-been or would-be jesuit he felt reinforced in his view that each of these two men would take pleasure in the occupation and status of the other, as something closely related to his own
the extreme polyphonic harshness of this work (and not just this work) has been the cause of much scorn and hatred
i would love to have some good person on my side
her passionate opposition was crushed beneath his desire for takin’ things easy, and the upshot of all this was that herr permaneder withdrew the capital he had invested in the hops business and it was now herr noppe’s turn to draw a blue line through the & co on his calling card
but all i can do is describe my experience and admit the profound awkwardness that this boy's gently floating existence always caused me
oh, certainly not, no children
were there but a war without, that something might be afoot
prince esterhazy, for example, had been a special friend of this masterly art, but in the m ass in c that beethoven had written for him, the composer had managed no more than unsuccessful stabs at a fugue, which, purely socially, had been a bit of bad manners and, artistically, an unforgivable failing; and his oratorio, christ on the mount of olives, lacked any sort of fugal passage, although it would have most definitely been in order there
for germany, the opposite is true, and you would feel and know it, leverkiihn, if only you were not adrian leverkiihn-that is, too cool to be young and too clever to be religious
it can all turn out fine
the discussion was interrupted only by our visit to the church and was essentially a dispute between rudi schwerdtfeger and myself about ludwig's so-called madness, his incompetence to govern, and his being removed from the throne and placed under a guardian-which to rudi's great astonishment i declared an unjustified and brutal act of philistinism, as well as a political maneuver to secure the succession
you can be our referee
that is—, he said
what did the maid say?
it was arranged for rudiger to graduate from high school and be sent off to university
plaster casts of classical statuary were set out on a shelf that went clear around the room, and there was a large cupboard with all sorts of wooden blocks and dollhouse furniture that likewise served as models
for some time now, clavdia had been sitting for her portrait, posing for someone right here in the house
but when he raised his eyes again, she was no longer there
i was outraged by this denial of the humane in favor of an unapproachable, absolute predestination-just as, in general, i acknowledge dante's poetical greatness, but have always been put off by his penchant for cruelty and scenes of torture-and i recall that i scolded adrian for having decided to compose music for this almost unbearable episode
but in what a state?
we were speaking of my mail
and now, while the nurse raises the baby’s bonnet, the pastor carefully dips his fingers in the silver basin—lined with gold—that has been set in front of him, and he sprinkles two or three drops of water on the sparse hair of this little buddenbrook, while slowly and expressively speaking the baptismal names: justus, johann, kaspar

the exchange of greetings consisted of mute bows, so stiff they were practically indiscernible
joachim responded with silence from his side of the glass partition
hans castorp waved good-bye to the table as it drifted away—farewell!
play it for her, it is certain to please her, and the rest will take care of itself
settembrini said and raised his eyebrows
it was an hour when all the patients mingled, an hour of opportunities, and for precisely that reason an hour that young hans castorp loved and longed for
he paid no attention to his sister’s plaintive words or her conjectures as to what her friend armgard would now do with her life, nor did he notice that, without actually turning her head his way, gerda had fixed her eyes—those close-set brown eyes with bluish shadows at the corners—firmly on him, searching his face
he’ll understand that this is no routine sale, no ordinary house
and then it will take another two months, i suppose, for his ship to sail all that way

a patriotism, however, that would boldly proclaim that the bloody state whose gasping agonies we are now experiencing, that saddled itself
herr albin let out a brief laugh—a fluttery, ragged laugh
those who envied and opposed the audacious innovator had always claimed in fact, so we were told, that beethoven could not write a fugue
the aunt could not give him definite hopes of an opportunity for another interview
and what does hard and cold mean?
by which i don’t mean the soloist’s dependence on accompaniment, although that can be distressing on occasion
and having once established that point of view, it was only logical, then, to treat the body accordingly, to bestow upon it certain disciplinary methods, which, if one dared take another risk, might likewise be called mystically evil
i mean to say: what is medical science concerned with?
how could people with no worries possibly judge his situation?
here is the door, it is open, there are no bars, no barriers, nothing—just a threshold

for two men had flung themselves down there beside one another—they were friends
what i want to say is
well, and you slept well, did you, ziemssen?
but these new charges leveled against illusion and games-that is, against form itself-seemed to imply that the expanding realm of the banal, of what was no longer permissible, threatened to swallow art whole
i call the piece a fugue, and it has a fugal feeling, although the theme is never faithfully repeated, but rather is itself developed along with the development of the whole, so that a style, to which the artist apparently wished to subject himself, is dismantled and carried, so speak, to absurdity-and all of this accomplished not without reference to the archaic fugue forms of certain canzoni and ricercari of the period before bach, in which the fugue's theme is not always clearly defined and adhered to
there is no doubt that it would be appropriate to judge him as lost and confused and worthy of our gravest concern
at home, she was closest to her poor and equally pious cousin klothilde, whose father had died recently and who was toying with the idea of establishing herself—which meant taking the few pennies and sticks of furniture that she had inherited and finding lodgings somewhere
they pressed their arms to their sides, rocked forward on the balls of their feet, bowed their heads, and bit their tongues in a frenzy of servility
it was no small matter, definitely not
then he left with kai
was their teasing him with gaffky numbers driving him to despair?
herr permaneder is an energetic climber
that’s all, he added, laying what remained of his cigar in the ashtray
a few people shushed him, and i , too, turned disapprovingly toward the speaker, even if secretly i was grateful to him for his words
was all in her telegram
young hans castorp found all this well worth listening to—not that he was obliged to, of course, it was more an experiment—but in any case, well worth listening to, and he said as much to joachim ziemssen, who had just stuck a thermometer in his mouth and so could only mumble a reply and then became too involved in reading the numbers and entering them on his chart to be able to comment on settembrini’s views
there’s no denying it
there were offices both to one side of the vestibule door and at the far end of the passage, whereas the doors to the cellar and the kitchen, still fragrant with tart shallot sauce, were to the left of the stairway

for each was as much a military calling as the other, in every sense: in asceticism and hierarchy, in obedience and spanish sense of honor
their son was there, too—august, a blond young man who exuded prosperity; with him was his wife, julie, née hagenström, who was sitting between her brothers, hermann and moritz—a short, energetic woman with large bright black eyes and equally large diamonds dangling from her earlobes
and suddenly there were only three or four paltry days left, a remnant hardly worth considering, though given some weight by the two upcoming periodical deviations in the daily routine, but already filled with thoughts of packing and farewell
that inner state was strong within him, too; he was not the man—not he, either—to extricate himself from it
for which reason they asked nottebohm to paint very expensive, very similar and inexpressive likenesses, one of each individually, and one of them together-and later, once children arrived, the jester was commissioned to produce a life-size family portrait of the institorises, an insipid representation, over whose considerable expanse a great quantity of highly varnished oils was squandered, and which, set in a costly frame and provided with its own el�ctric illumination from above and below, adorned the reception room

sesame weichbrodt appeared in her black dress, but on her bonnet were brand-new green ribbons draping the curls at her ears

and hans castorp had no trouble following suit, because when he took his seat again at the end of the table, between the teacher and miss robinson, it seemed as if he had been gone for a day at most
and because they wanted so much to get a little closer to the heart of the matter, to learn and understand even something of what made her tick, their limited imaginations led them to assume—how could it be otherwise?—that beautiful gerda was cheating on her aging husband
it’s enough to make a botanist of you, the young man said to his companion

and just as the two negotiators entered, the serving boy, clad in shirtsleeves and a good-natured smile, was dragging in another round of bottles; and although the evening was now well advanced and it was much too late to give any attention to the revision of the constitution, no one was inclined to interrupt the get-together and go home
those were no serious interruptions, no obstacles worth taking seriously
the old man understood and nodded and went on eating, sitting very erect between the high mahogany back of his chair and the table, barely bending forward to his plate; and his grandson, seated opposite, would watch with silent, profound, and unconscious attention as his grandfather’s hands—beautiful, white, gaunt, aged hands, with rounded, sharply tapered fingernails and a green signet ring on the right forefinger—arranged a bite of meat, vegetable, and potato on the tip of the fork with a few practiced motions and guided it to the mouth with just the least forward tip of the head
i peek into the office every few days
not everyone who goes about in long clothing and cries, lord, lord!
you’ll have to ask him that yourself, but i fear you won’t find him very talkative, because even if it was all done in a more bourgeois fashion, he was nevertheless sworn to silence
he dismounted, confused and dazed by what had happened to him, although he had not felt anything at all during the penetration
i trifle not in the least, nor even at all, when i speak of time given and of an appointed end, but am speaking narrowly to our argument
these were manly amusements, for which a glass of beer stood on the floor beside each player, who probably had a cigar in his mouth as well, and which were frequently interrupted by comments-breaking into the language of tones with an especially dry and odd sound-or by the tapping of bows and the counting back of bars whenever things got out of sync, which was almost always the choral director's fault
you see how skinny i am
time seemed so strangely far-fetched and yet immediately wakened certain premonitions-when adrian's intentions slowly revealed themselves as a work that he mastered by letting it master him and for which his energies had been gathering even as they lay in torment?

he paid no attention to it, or in his usual fashion he would shrug it off after a curiously anxious moment of thinking things over
he had been standing and when i finished quickly sat down in one of the wicker armchairs, but then demonstrated the composure of a man who had lived for a long time in an oppressively menacing atmosphere

it required no effort of imagination for hans castorp to share in the tenor’s ecstasy and gratitude, but as he sat there with folded hands, staring at the little black louvers, from between whose slats this all burst forth, ultimately what he felt, understood, and relished was the victorious ideality of music, of art, of human emotions, their sublime and incontrovertible ability to gloss over the crude horrors of reality

the look he directed at me was the look, that familiar look that made me unhappy-and it mattered little whether it was aimed at me or someone else-mute, veiled, so coldly aloof as to be almost offensive, and it was followed by the smile, with lips closed, nostrils twitching in scorn, and by his turning away

who is making this stink here?—and he noticed too late, or perhaps not at all, that his wife was blushing terribly, that old madame buddenbrook, thomas, and gerda sat there like statues, that the ladies buddenbrook exchanged pointed glances, that even rieke severin, at the far end of the table, looked offended and simply gazed straight ahead, and that only old consul kröger managed to splutter softly
but then, in the middle of that battle, in the middle of all the dispatches, letters, and calculations, this had befallen him as well
kaisersaschern lies, to be sure, in the middle of the homeland of the reformation, in the heart of luther country, with which one associates names of towns like eisleben, wittenberg, quedlinburg, but also grimma, wolfenbiittel, and eisenach-which, in turn, helps explain the inner life of leverkiihn, the lutheran, and also ties into his original course of study, theology

hans castorp was taken aback by the old noblewoman’s manner of speech

granted, there was no sufficient reason for this sympathy—particularly if one disregarded such things as his heathen name, his status as a model pupil (which, indeed, could have played no role whatever), or those kirghiz eyes, which from time to time, in certain sidelong glances, when gazing at nothing in particular, could darken, almost melt, to a veiled dusky look—but whatever the reason, hans castorp did not worry about the intellectual or emotional basis of his reaction, or even what name he would give it if he had to

there was considerable discussion during the meal and afterward in the abbot's study about political and moral matters, about the mythic emergence of national character that occurs at such historical junctures and concerning which i spoke with some emotion in order to provide a little counterbalance to the drastically empirical view of war that schildknapp saw as the only permissible one; we talked, that is, about germany's role, about the violation of belgium, so very reminiscent of frederick the great's incursion into formally neutral saxony, about the world's shrill cry of outrage and about our philosophical chancellor's speech, with its brooding admission of guilt, its proverbial, and untranslatable, assertion that necessity knows no law, and its disregardanswerable solely before god-of an old legal document in face of our present life-threatening exigency

for when the dutchman was not confined to bed, he seldom failed to gather about him a small, constantly changing assortment of berghof guests for after-dinner games with wine and other regalements, either in the social rooms as on that first occasion, or in the restaurant; and hans castorp would take his customary seat between the great man and the careless woman

they also surrounded consul buddenbrook, who was sure to know how mayor oeverdieck felt about the matter, because the previous year senator dr oeverdieck, a brother-in-law of consul justus kröger, had become president of the senate and mayor—and that meant that the buddenbrooks were now related to the mayor, which greatly enhanced the esteem in which they were held

hans castorp remained with those up here for seven years—no round number for devotees of the decimal system, and yet a good, handy number in its way, a mythic, romantic bundle of time, one might say, more satisfying to the soul than a plain half-dozen

well, he said a great many things about money, the soul of the state, as he put it, and spoke out against property, because it’s thievery, and against capitalist wealth in general, which he said, i believe, was fuel for the fires of hell—at least if i’m not mistaken that’s how he put it—and sang the praises of the medieval injunction against interest

they walked through the bare garden, which lay under a blanket of melting snow, took a quick look at the portal, then turned back to the front courtyard; taking the narrow, flagstone path to the left of the scullery; passing between walls on either side, they entered the back courtyard, where the oak tree stood, and approached the back building
although i must admit that i used to be bored now and then, fräulein tony; but that was several weeks ago

it was clear that under a, to be sure, well-chosen pretext, the contadino was here giving vent to a certain animosity toward the educated member of the family, even though-or perhaps because-in his heart of hearts sor alfo shared the admiration all manardis felt for the lawyer, whom they regarded as a kind of statesman

having been examined in his godly skills by the rabbi, who then authorized him to slaughter acceptable animals according to the law of moses and the regulations of the talmud, elia naphta was himself filled with a quiet religiosity; there had been something priestly about him and his blue eyes, which, as his son described them, had glittered like stars and radiated a solemnity recalling ancient times when the slaughtering of animals had indeed been the duty of priests

they in no way felt the war to be the deep and severing rift in history that it appeared to be to us, and instead saw in it a disruption that had now come to a happy conclusion, after which life would be returned to the track out of which it had been shunted
he could bear it no longer; he shoved his armchair back, left the office, and climbed the stairs
that would assure what i call the neutrality of harmony and melody
an hour later, hanno lay in his bed, which had recently been placed in a little room off the third-floor corridor, just to the left of the senator’s dressing room
shame, shame, herr permaneder!
do have a seat, herr kasten, herr carsten, or whatever your name was
the largest room in a prince's castle is usually the throne room
do you see those adhesions?
tall, broad-shouldered, with small hips and long legs, he wore-day in, day out-the same rather shabby plaid breeches, long woolen socks, sturdy ocher shoes, a shirt of coarse linen with an open collar, and over that a kind of jacket of by now indeterminate color and with sleeves that were too short
did he feel liberated, was his mind easier—or did his spirit suffer great privation when he saw one whole side of the table empty?
yes, tony, this would interest you especially
with a quick sidelong glance of his own, he discovered that frau chauchat was paying him no attention, and so he stood in his usual pose beside the bed—weight on one leg, hands clasped before the abdomen, head tilted to one side—gazing down in thoughtful reverence
call it, or because her personality quite spontaneously called up in him certain nervous, embarrassed inhibitions
and so one might very well conclude that, as a goal for an excursion, it was more morally fitting than many others—the movie theater or the start of the bobsled run, for instance—particularly since paying a visit to those people up there was nothing more than an act of comradely respect, assuming, of course, that one did not regard the cemetery simply as one of the town’s sights, a standard goal for a standard walk
by the way, that brings me to another thought
their faces were not exactly radiant with joy, and their conversation was not exactly spirited
well, yes, but that’s not quite how she meant it
herr behrens, i simply must speak to you for a moment
what were they thinking?
he was not all that strict about demanding great dexterity in practicing scales, or at least he did not see it as the purpose of practice
but father leverkiihn would reprimand us with a hush!
the senator laid his newspaper on the table beside him, slipped his pince-nez into his vest pocket, and rubbed his hand across his brow and eyes
dr gieseke, she said, crossing her arms, laying her head back, and staring at the ceiling, you are a man who knows life well, both in a personal and a professional sense
the visitor in august had long ago become a comrade—dr
before you lie to me again, just see for yourself if it isn’t lukewarm dishwater no respectable human being could possibly drink!
whereas with highly differentiated beings like you and me, the skin’s sole aspiration is to be tickled
do you think you can simply sweep it under the rug?
he’ll climb back up, wander right up the column, old mercury will, she said
you are small—but what is that to me?
he jotted a satisfactory in his notebook, and hanno buddenbrook sat down
and i did hear your name mentioned once or twice
schildknapp, who was also well-versed in music, was an adaptation of the text; but he would hear nothing of it, in part because he had his own work to do and also probably in part because adrian could hardly have compensated him at the time
because you fill up your days with the theater and strolling about and buffooneries, creating a whole series of feelings and sensitivities and conditions to keep yourself occupied, to observe and nurse them, so that you can shamelessly babble on about them
it’s twenty hours from hamburg to davos—true, by train
do you have anything in particular, anyone special in mind when you say we do not live for life but for enrichment?
you have constructed a theological theory that ascribes to man an eminently honorable, if perhaps somewhat one-sided religious function
people of herr settembrini’s sort, the doubters and critics, had observed this fact and seen to it that the old naive form of justice was replaced by the inquisition, which no longer depended on god’s intervening on behalf of truth, but was aimed at obtaining the truth through the confession of the accused
the consul pressed his lips together again; he was thoroughly satisfied
what have i done to deserve such doubt and hesitation?
it wasn’t boredom that bothered him; on the contrary, he began to fear that the end of his stay was winging its way toward him
he returned to the institution where he had been a pupil and was given a position as prefect, a supervisor of the students, a teacher of philosophy and humanities
entering through a parlor that separated frau chauchat’s room from the dutchman’s
so they would stay until he was better
even this theme failed to rouse anyone
or the other one, it doesn’t matter
and after all, this isn’t a siberian salt mine
i did not seduce her, she seduced me, and little lnstitoris's horns, to use a stupid expression, are purely her work, not mine
compared with lnstitoris, who merely instructed about beauty, rudolf had on his side the advantage of art-which nourishes passion and transfigures all things human
ending in her ecstatic cry, this torch, and though it be my life's own light, laughing now, i do not quail to quench (whereby the singer emphasized the dramatic action with an energetic downward thrust of her arm), it would not have taken much for me to have knelt with tears in my eyes before this triumphantly smiling woman now showered with applause
but he paid no attention
and that dreamy way he had about him—did it not sometimes border on simple-mindedness?
his dramatic sensitivities overcame him and he gave a performance
we walked back together to the schweigestill house, where we were strangely touched by the truly scarcely remarkable fact that as before, despite the old man's departure, the atmosphere was heavy with the pungent aroma of pipe smoke issuing from the open living room, although it was surely also deeply impregnated in the walls of the hallway
yes, even he, to whom all pettiness had once been so alien, had developed his own kind of pedantry, although it grew out of a different personality structure and emotional makeup
he would bury his hands in his coat pockets and roll his shoulders pointlessly or clear his throat noisily while pounding his chest with his fist—all to proclaim his indifference
i chose you for this mission of love because you are far more in your element there than, let us say, serenus zeitblom
he listens to the voice of duty—and what he hears is the license of passion
i am, to be frank, not a passionate man, but i do have my passions, detached passions
and at that a flabbergasted hans castorp could not help banging his hand on the table
you are a rich man
there were twelve in all, in two different formats, twelve records to each; and since many of the circular disks were minutely etched on both sides—not simply because many pieces required two sides, but also because a good number of them offered two different selections—it was difficult at first to get an overview of this confusing world of beautiful possibilities waiting to be conquered
no one said anything
he had fallen face-down, and a puddle of blood immediately began to form around his head
christian—or krischan, as he usually was called, for good or ill—knew them all as friends or acquaintances from the old days—most of them had been students of the late marcellus stengel—and he was received with open arms, for, although neither the merchants nor the professionals considered him a great intellect, they recognized his amusing social gifts
and beneath that is the layer of fat, the upholstery, you know—the foundation of fat cells that creates the gorgeous female form
it goes without saying that by this date i mean the point marking my present activity-not the one to which my narrative has advanced, for that is the autumn of    , twenty-two months prior to the outbreak of the previous war, when adrian returned to munich from palestrina with rudiger schildknapp and for his part took temporary lodging in a small hotel (the pension gisella) in schwabing
we’ll swelter if we have to march off in this heat—it’s quite unnatural
they all talked at once in loud, jocular voices, gave one another encouraging pokes in the ribs, and made a point of showing just how at ease they were
her tired, watery-blue eyes—herr grünlich’s eyes—said that she had learned to submit to life’s disappointments, and her composed, sometimes slightly whiny voice said as much as well
as far as possible the ladies and gentlemen were seated in pairs, the long chain of the family broken here and there by friends
his uniform jacket was unbuttoned, revealing the full curve of his white vest
so then tell me, what do you think of me?
do you like it?
the drudgeries that do on occasion precede death can hardly be credited to him, since they just prove that someone is alive and kicking and may lead back to life and health
i don’t like to see him smoking, either, it makes me uneasy somehow, because i know it’s not good for him and makes him melancholy
and now everyone was standing stiffly beside our table: hans castorp and the two opponents, and facing them ferge and wehsal
have you measured your temperature?
it was pure, unadulterated religious egoism
people stared in bewilderment at the face of this charming specter, who seemed to see them and yet did not, who was not at all affected by their gaze, and whose laughter and waves were not meant for the present, but belonged to the then and there of home—it would have been pointless to respond
i should not, by the way, have let myself be so aggrieved by all kinds of irregularities in how he expressed himself, since to some extent, just as he had always liked to do when writing, he used a kind of antiquated german, which, given its defects and incomplete sentences, had always had something dubious and careless about it-and indeed, how long has it been since our tongue outgrew its barbaric stage and has to some extent obeyed both grammatical and orthographical rules
she crossed the cool, flagstone-paved hallway, which was decorated with reliefs in the style of thorvaldsen and from which a door led to offices on the right; she rang the vestibule door, which could be opened from the kitchen simply by pressing a little rubber ball, and as she stood admiring the roomy entrance hall, where the tiburtiuses’ bear now stood at the foot of the main staircase, she was informed by anton the butler that the senator was still at work
i’ll just go sit back there on those stones
anything you’d like, consul buddenbrook—crabs, shrimp, all kinds of cold cuts, cheeses, smoked eel, smoked salmon, smoked sturgeon
hans castorp himself had felt a dry flush, day in, day out, without having a fever—at least as far as he could judge without a thermometer
you lost your sense of poetry, although you were brave to love and marry against your father’s wishes
these were books on anatomy, physiology, and biology, written in various languages—german, french, and english—and sent him one day by the local bookdealer; evidently he had ordered them, on his own and without a word to anyone, while taking a walk down in platz alone
they responded to his greetings with poignant courtesy and warmth, addressing him as herr lieutenant
in her panic, frau stöhr was not ashamed of breaking into prayer
at the start; and at first that is what they were
but gerda and thomas had already agreed on a trip across northern italy to florence
he was very depressed, and even his blasphemies had no real joy in them
i remember as if it were yesterday
classicism-yes; nothing sophisticated about any of it, but it is great
and no harm meant!
they spoke of his splendid house in the hague and his villa in scheveningen
he had arrived on a tuesday and so it was his fifth day, an almost springlike day after the bizarre turn in the weather that had thrown them back into winter—mild, yet fresh, with tidy clouds in a bright blue sky and a sun shining gently on the slopes and valley, which now had returned to their proper summer green, because the recent snowfall had been doomed to melt quickly
in paris, the road to fame leads through notoriety
i heard that you were in here, he said gruffly
it was a little after nine-thirty when she left her room
i can’t tell you what satisfaction it gives me to see that they’ve finally begun work on the gas lanterns and are getting rid of those ghastly oil lamps hanging from chains
the only person who gets upset and angry …
where comparison was lacking, he said, any standard of measurement was lacking, and one could not speak even of heavy or light, of large or small
what kind of gloomy talk is that?
but as your fellow resident, i now take my leave of you
autumn came, and the old gray walls collapsed into heaps of rubbish
someone at the harmony told me about a remark you made yesterday evening at the club—a remark so out of place, so indescribably tactless that i cannot find words for it
he beheld the image of life, its voluptuous limbs, its flesh-borne beauty
there was bishop’s punch in undrinkable quantities, and sesame’s plain gingerbread cake was terribly tasty
and, given these circumstances, turned to the lord of heaven, begging him to protect the life of his dearest sister in the meantime
as he passed, various people noticed that tears would suddenly well up in his eyes and that his lips were set tight, but in an odd, cautious, skewed sort of way
and herr pfühl declared himself willing to give hanno lessons
inez negotiated it all much more easily, for the simple reason that she was passionately in love-and he was all the more prepared to call it that, because her love was based on her false imaginings
far be it from me to deny the seriousness of art; but when things get serious one scorns art and is no longer capable of it
his suit was still an indeterminate color, with a button missing here and there, and the seat of his pants consisted of a large patch
the city, that ghastly scene in the landscape room, her parents’ and pastor kölling’s reprimands—that all lay far behind her
he is a true patriot, as you know, a democratic patriot
with the exception of pianos, which adrian's foster-father left to the industry specializing in them, there lay spread out before one everything that chimes and sings, that twangs, brays, rumbles, rattles, and booms-even the keyboard instruments were always represented, too, by a celesta with its charming bell-like tones
he dreamed that he saw director behrens wandering along the paths of the garden, his knees slightly bent, his arms hanging stiffly at an angle in front of him, matching his slow and yet somehow bleak strides to the rhythm of march music in the distance
well, then, at least give me a papyrosa, my lost young man, she said, sitting down opposite him next to the stove, on a bench cushioned with a linen pillow
to spurn, to forgo, to disparage-that was not incompetence or ignorance, not proof of intellectual poverty
well, say what y’want, hagenström’s a lot richer
everyone in the dining hall looked up
but it really belongs more to astrology
how could it have been otherwise?
so you don’t notice the difference in height that much
a clever artifice, as if pilfered from your opera
and so, in short, i shall marry again
the realm of the subconscious, the occult realm in the etymological sense of the word, very quickly turns out to be occult in the narrower sense as well and forms one of the sources for phenomena that emerge from it and to which we apply that same makeshift term
and speak of my opera, too, no less
everyone laughs and stands on tiptoe to see who the wag is
they were drinking their mocha now, served in little earthen-brown jugs, and some had liqueurs as well—frau stöhr for example, who simply loved to sip sweet spirits
and then aghast at his own social blunder, at the drunken dreaminess of his words, he assured them that was not what he had meant to say
time is a gift of the gods to humankind, that we may use it—use it, my good engineer, in the service of human progress
it was josephus, who was sitting at the back of his shiny cage, head tilted, staring at him with little, nasty, spiteful eyes
upon admission and after her first checkup, she had been considered only a mild case; but whether she had not been conscientious in her rest cure, whether this was a case in which the air at first was not just good for fighting off illness, but for illness, or whether the young lady had become involved in intrigues or excitements that had not done her any good—in any case, four weeks after her arrival, she entered the dining hall upon returning from a new checkup, tossed her purse in the air, and cried in a clear voice, hurrah, i have to stay a whole year!
the salon on the other side of the hallway on the ground floor has new yellow blinds and looks very elegant
dynamics, hans castorp finished the sentence for him
in this case, the door was divided into little glass panes, which only heightened the shock: it was a bang and a rattle
he was, after all, quite unaware that there was such a thing as immoralism, and one cannot very well say someone is right if he has no understanding of the counterthesis-at least not before one has explained it to him
except, the end is ours, in the end he is ours, that demands agreement, and not merely of the silent sort, however silent things may else proceed, but from man to man and expressly
he was a very fine man
the corridor floor with its coconut runners undulated gently under his feet, but he found it was not all that unpleasant a sensation
or less the first words adrian spoke to me when we met again concerned this almost perfectly flawless copy and what joy it gave him
there the body stood, leaning charmingly, turning to smile at him, its radiant elbows spread wide in the dual symmetry of its limbs, of its corporeality
yes, that’s how it looked to them, he knew it
it’s really absurd—if you were at home, you would send for heidekind
but it’s a bit of vanity that gotthold should have respected
the first, his neighbor on the left, was a k ferge, the good-natured martyr from saint petersburg, from under whose bushy reddish-brown moustache came anecdotes about the manufacture of galoshes and tales of distant regions, the arctic circle, and the perpetual winter at north cape
for to her knowing, melancholy eyes, did not rudolf represent the dearness of life itself?
actually i had only one: why in fact, if adrian wished to let marie know that he was interested in seeing her, did he not approach her directly, call her up, even travel to munich, pay the ladies a visit, present his suggestion to them?
at the same time he opened his mouth as if to sing, but from between his lips there emerged only a wail that still rings in my ears
who are those people’?
it was impossible for the effect hanno’s playing had had on him to be transferred to his audience
he was certainly a whole man, though in manikin form, and through him inez learned about desire-a luckless desire, on whose meager soil her passion could grow wild
where did you get that idea?
the gentlemen will just have to make do with me
you have come to an agreement with my stepsister and her husband in frankfurt, and i have no intention of interfering in the matter
hans castorp, however, was not wearing seven fur coats but only a woolen vest, which would normally have been quite enough for him—he even found it annoying at the first hint of sunshine
do you follow me, my good engineer?
hans castorp drank thirstily from the tall pint glass
fine, hubmeyer, deutschlin said, what you say is all quite correct, and in any case i will grant you that your critique has brought us closer to the problem
although i don’t suppose there’s any reason i’d ever need to know it
a great uneasiness came over him, a need for movement, space, and light
a neutral middle point
the confusion of the move would not be pleasant, but she was enthralled with the prospect of a large music room with good acoustics
that was a logical suggestion
settembrini begged for moderation here, although his voice was filled with passion, because he found it intolerable that herr naphta kept talking about the bourgeoisiosity of life in such a—god only knew why—disdainful, aristocratic tone, as if the opposite—and everyone knew what the opposite of life was—was somehow more noble
what had monday meant then?
you think it necessary, then?
there was reason enough for him to turn pale
after all the awful things i’ve had to experience in life
the others did not respond
but i simply cannot bring myself to reject grünlich out of hand
and his wife could not resist extending their guest her hand, her gold bracelet tinkling as she turned the palm upward as far as possible to heighten the gesture’s warmth
there was something even more feverish now about the way madame buddenbrook’s hand kept moving in a gesture peculiarly her own, from one corner of her mouth up to her coiffure, as if she were tucking back a stray hair
of course he fully intended to get up at half past five and do his most pressing homework
she did not look at him, did not change her stiff upright position, did not stop her knitting—on the contrary, there was a marked increase in the speed at which the needles whirred in her hands
she suddenly cried and sank back onto her pillows
he felt an enervating urge to remain there in his mother’s arms, at her breast, where the gentle scent of perfume lingered on the soft silk of her dress, to close his eyes and never to have to see or say anything more
when the dwarf reported that his baggage was strapped to the carriage, he hastily jumped to his feet to bid farewell to his tablemates
do you imagine this will stop your father—old as he is?
he stood there and watched her smile and talk, just as pribislav hippe had smiled and talked in the schoolyard years before, her mouth open rather wide and her slanting gray-green eyes above her strong cheekbones narrowing to little slits
my friend, that is asia
by no means, tony
grabow had managed it all quite casually, almost without his noticing
it may well have been, by the way, that all these natives of the deep regarded the beaconed guest that had descended to them as an oversize subspecies of themselves, for most of them could do what it could do-that is, shed light all on their own
but she is a child, bethsy; she enjoys her fun, dancing at balls, being courted by young men, relishes it all, because she knows she’s pretty and comes from a good family
dressed in shimmering silk, which was all the rage, tony was sitting on the sofa beside her mother, who was wearing a gown of heavy gray ribbed silk, trimmed with black lace
everyone should be treated equally as a child of the state, and just as there are no longer any middlemen between the layman and his god, so each citizen should stand in direct relation to the state
how does he like it in wismar?
no, he had not actually settled in yet, neither in terms of his intimacy with life here in all its peculiarities—an intimacy it would be impossible to gain in so few days, or as he told himself (and admitted quite candidly to joachim), in three weeks, sad to say—nor as regarded the adaptation of his organism to the very peculiar atmospheric conditions found among the people up here, because it seemed to him that his physical adjustment was proceeding only painfully, very painfully, if indeed at all
jonathan leverkiihn did not send his children to the village common school
at the same time he is overcome by physical lassitude, which affects not only his muscles and tendons, but also the function of all internal organs, and most especially the stomach, which rebels and refuses to accept any food
it has been pronounced by director behrens, in that special cheerful way of his
herr permaneder did not just stand there
for a good two and a half weeks a splendid sky reigned above mountains and valley, each new day outdoing the last for sheer blue purity; and the sun burned with such intensity that everyone found good reason to dig out his or her lightest summer clothes, the cast-aside muslin dresses and linen trousers; and even the large white canvas sunshade, which had no handle but was ingeniously fixed with a peg and several holes to the arm of the lounge chair, offered only inadequate protection from the midday glare
i don’t know whether it was mine or yours
we’re here for a christenin’, and you’re already at the rottin’
and the senator slipped a coin into the hand holding the brush, then strode across the entrance hall and through the reception room opening off it
hans castorp had not seen it happen, but then he saw it
did not let it bother me that a familiar difficulty was augmented a bit by the terror outside
and on the wound the serpent
darkest night reigned—the curtains at the high windows had been pulled tight
he’s a regular fountain of information
her hatred of this particular upstart family was nursed by the mere thought that the hagenströms might now feel justified in thinking they could look down on her, but no less by the family’s flourishing prosperity
shadows now reached halfway up it; but the upper portion was bathed in softest pink
in the second cellar, on the right, the second bin, behind the red bordeaux, two bottles, you hear?
so it may well be that it runs in the family a little—behrens at least dropped a hint to that effect
this more or less occupied the time until frau grünlich appeared
madame buddenbrook gazed at her lap and smiled a half-embarrassed smile full of memories
i think i shall stay, gerda said and sank with a sigh of relief into an easy chair beside one of the beds
i: if you could but keep silence, you jackanapes
no, you can count on me
well, i can’t speak as to the hat
he had been there only a half hour before to give an injection of camphor, had just missed the moment of swift passing
it was an excursion just like this
on the other hand: you simply give frankfurt ,, which means the firm comes out , to the good
a preference for indeed was also evident, in phrases like it was pretty indeed, and other such oddities
lower your voice, kesselmeyer
you’re impressed, aren’t you?
hans castorp was listening to this narrative with edgy bemusement
and indeed mercury had stretched himself, very robustly
from the standpoint of beauty, institoris said, will was not to be praised, but only talent and it alone was to be pronounced meritorious
what is it i should know, my dear wenzel?
i can well believe that he knows your body not merely as a doctor, but also as an initiate in another humanistic discipline
his dream was already beginning to fade
upon their return, rudolf enjoyed the prerogative that until then had been exclusively mine because of a shared childhood-he and adrian addressed each other by the familiar you
and as for dr salzmann, he claimed that professor kafka did not keep his syringes sterile and infected his patients with other diseases
that accorded with my own feelings
and correcting himself, he added, to be with my regiment inside of three weeks
were it not better for one to learn all that-suspension, passing tones, modulation, preparations, and resolutions-in praxi, from hearing, from experience and self-discovery, rather than from some book?
ultimately there is only one problem in the world, and its name is: how does one break through?
after an initial c, it takes on a c-sharp before the d, so that it now no longer scans as
herr modersohn was supposed to demonstrate his teaching style, present a model lesson, and show what his sophomores had learned in six or seven hours under his instruction
your settings of verlaine's poems are the best proof of it
the decision has been made
but she kept her eyes lowered, directing them no higher than his chest; and playing at the corners of her mouth was the mocking and totally merciless smile with which a young lady measures a man and finds him wanting
her upper lip—the same slightly protruding, arched upper lip that had always helped to make her face so pretty—was quivering now, and she was so overwrought that her eyes, although large with fear, kept blinking as they stared straight ahead, almost as if they, too, were in a hurry
but when one is deeply moved, one has the courage to say things that may sound crass and irreverent, but are more solemn than authorized words of piety
he calculated displacements—with full cargo and empty—stabilities, shifts in trim, and metacenters, though it was drudgery at times
right, you want to be something different every day, tom said
at first he had left tracks in the snow with his poles, planting them deep, but very soon he quite intentionally freed himself of their tutelage, because it reminded him of the man blowing his little horn and seemed inconsistent with his own innermost feelings for this vast winter wilderness
upon hearing what i had to say, herr grünlich became quite desperate, crying that he loved you so much and the pain of losing you would be so great that he was prepared to take his own life if you were to persist in your decision
thomas, who was destined from birth to be a merchant and the future owner of the firm, attended modern, scientific classes beneath the gothic arches of the old school
and he walked on, wearing those everlasting pastel checked trousers, leaving hans castorp behind, presumably cut to the quick by so much trenchant significance—and to some extent he was, although he was also vexed and amused by the notion that he was supposed to be
you may set your mind at ease—our procedures are quite aesthetic
what i am saying is: our level is that of civilized behavior-a very praiseworthy state, no doubt, but neither can there be any doubt that we would have to become much more barbaric to be capable of culture once again
to deny it would be a sin
we certainly have nothing to be ashamed of
halfway down the stairs, joachim stopped in his tracks when he saw hans castorp suddenly emerge from the consulting room where he had just been given his injection
as always, his hands were none too clean, but they were still narrow and exceptionally well formed, with long, slender fingers and tapering fingernails
i don’t see a wedding ring
what i have in mind is leverkiihn's (and since of course one ought not call it a preference for, then let us say) extraordinarily frequent use of the sliding tone, at least in this work, in the apocalypse, whose images of terror certainly supply the most enticing and, at the same, legitimate reasons for employing this wild device
one needed only to say to this era i have' a specific sense of life, and it immediately bowed deeply before it
the cross-bearer and the altar boy were stuck there at the door and couldn’t get in
in brief, everything as befits our family name
someone ran to get him, and he came: he broke into a rugged, pithy smile once he had the picture, his very presence demanding their cheerful trust
several trembling voices asked with foreboding
actually, only the surface of the little table and its immediate environs were illumined in soft red light
his face was all yellow, you say?
why, they must have cost you a fortune
the pinions had deceived us
i don’t have an answer for them
ready arrived at the matter-a matter in which you would be doing me much good
i propose subdividing rows into segments that would be related to one another and yet compress and combine the tonal relationships
they talked about events in town: the recent flooding, which had spilled into a great many cellars and required people to use boats to get around in the low-lying streets; a major fire in the sheds down by the harbor; a senate election
and you, tom, have you worked up some rough figures?
it has always struck me that way, although i’ve only noticed it just now, after the fact
i know he’s in the best of hands, she said, and departed for hamburg only eight days after she had arrived, since there was no serious need for her to offer special care, and besides, joachim had a relative for company
thomas, i need to speak with you at once
the first couples began to spin inside a little circle of spectators seated in chairs and on stools
one sunday evening in early july—senator buddenbrook had moved into his new home about four weeks before—frau permaneder paid her brother a call
moreover, leo’s restive mind and sophistry soon showed a rebellious streak; he made the acquaintance of the son of a social-democratic member of the reichsrat, and following the lead of this hero of the masses, had directed his mind along political paths, turning his passion for logic to the field of social criticism
he found the first theme in the d minor concerto to be quite good, but was convinced that brahms never came close to finding one equal to it
settembrini says his merriment is forced, and settembrini has a critical eye, is a man who forms his own opinions, one must grant him that much
she was forty-one years old, but, having never set much store by external appearances, she dressed like a woman in her sixties
you and the bank are not the only ones
the prophecy of the end, entitled apocalipsis cum figuris, resounded fiercely and grandly at frankfurt am main in february , approximately a year after the terrible events i have had to report, and it may be due to the depressed state in which they left him that adrian could not bring himself to break through his customary reserve and attend the event, which despite a lot of angry shouts and insipid laughter, was a great sensation
very tasteful, i must say—pious and money-hungry
you couldn’t pop in just anywhere wearing a uniform
'neath the banner of a maiden's shift marked by a wondrous cross
what may ensue and progress there will render you capable of quite other things, will pull down quite other obstacles and soar with you high above your lameness and hindrance
yes, it’s quite outrageous, wenzel
no one knows where jakob is at present, except his weak-willed mother, née oeverdieck, who is secretly selling off the family silver in order to send money to her disinherited son
hanno walked over to his desk, more or less in the middle of the room, shoved his satchel in the drawer, and sank down on the hard seat; stretching his arms out over the slanted top, he laid his head down
his trained voice rang out clear, supple, and pious in the cool, hushed autumn air and drifted across the open grave and the mourners’ heads, some bowed, some tilted wistfully to one side
they are people devoid of all manners, and although i am going to have to live next door to them for three weeks because there was no other way to arrange things, i do not wish to know them

let us always hope for the best
herr grünlich cried, leaping to his feet
but tom wants me to
come here, my child, and look at this, madame buddenbrook said, opening the lid
i recognize today’s mood; it is the same mood that reigns when the holidays of terra firma are religiously observed on those great arks—as reminders of a world outside, nostalgia as per calendar
hans castorp asked in response
herr settembrini’s voice sounded gentle, resigned, but it had a slight quiver in it as well
it’s much better than a scoundrel
but even if he laid it on a little thick, he was still low on the ladder, as it were, and so patience and reticence were certainly appropriate behavior
remarkably enough, the violin concerto was dedicated to him, but ultimately it had been the means by which the composer had first laid eyes on her
and there was one more reason, mynheer peeperkorn, hans castorp continued, one more reason why i wanted to make a clean breast of things—and that is that i know from personal experience how annoying uncertainty can be in this area, when one is at the mercy of surmises and guesses

in his bedroom, the hours for meals-adrian was not to take them with the family, that had not been expected, they took them too early for him, besides; a place would be set just for him at half-past one and at eight, and the best spot, frau schweigestill suggested, would be the large room at the front (the rustic drawing room with its winged victory and square piano), which was always at his disposal in any case
needless to say, entire lessons (extended, of course, without a second thought) were spent with kretzschmar playing it all for his pupil on the piano-losing himself ever deeper in details, moving from one thing to a thousand others, interjecting (as we know from his
but did you see, joachim went on, and his joy at having fought the good fight rose visibly, making him catch his breath, did you see how he backed off and capitulated when he realized that i was serious?
he was no longer an interval or hiatus, he was a patient; he, too, was questioned, instead of being left lying there to his own devices, as he had been every day until now—much to his slight and secret annoyance

there was a long pause
it is not for us to judge, my child, the consul replied
personal, in his middle period than toward the end; at that earlier stage he had been much more intent on letting all conventions, formulas, and flourishes (of which music was full after all) be consumed by personal expression, on fusing all that with the subjective dynamic
he once told me about dynamic drugs and poisonous asian trees, and it was so interesting it was almost eerie—interesting things are always a little eerie—and yet it was interesting not in and of itself, but actually only in connection with the effect of his personality

if you bring me back just enough to say that she does not find the idea of sharing my life with me totally repulsive, something monstrous-then my hour will come, then i will speak with her and her aunt myself
for by its very nature, theology, once it is linked with the spirit of life philosophy, with irrationalism, runs the risk of becoming demonology
and you even spoke to us about carducci that first day
with the start of the next year, then, wendell kretzschmar left kaisersaschern to assume his new position, and so from that point on their correspondence passed between halle and leipzig: kretzschmar's pages covered on just one side in scratches and splatters of large, stiff print; and adrian's messages written on rough, yellowish paper in his regular, slightly old-fashioned, and somewhat ornate handwriting, obviously executed with a round-hand pen
we insert that sort of thing into the mainstream of our lives as a kind of interruption or interlude, for the purpose of recreation, which is to say: a refreshing, revitalizing exercise of the organism, because it was in immediate danger of overindulging itself in the uninterrupted monotony of daily life, of languishing and growing indifferent
both of which you apparently fear
the critics remarked on a certain lack of unity in its style, indeed in its niveau of composition, and the audiences likewise responded with somewhat more reserve than in vienna, but nonetheless not only gave the performers lively ovations, but also, on both evenings, insisted on the appearance

—no, that’s not what happened to him
for the next few days, he was in a splendid mood—there was freedom and a bounce in his step, kindness in his expression
was it written for me?
he would carefully stroke his mustache with two fingers, compulsively rearrange his writing utensils and the glass of water that always stood on his desk, examine each issue from several sides, always with a wool-gathering look on his face; and he also had the habit of crossing the courtyard to the scullery, five or six times a day during office hours—where he would hold his head under the tap to refresh himself
he knew what was what and made a point of my special relation to this fine art-the most christian of arts, he deems it-posited in the negative, to be sure, employed and developed by christendom, true, but repudiated and excluded as a demonic realm-and there you have it
he offered no reply whatever
but it was always one of the extremes, the sheen of pitch or the flash of blue between the lashes, that captivated him
as hans castorp learned from his cousin, this was one of a series of popular-scientific talks presented under the general title love as a force conducive to illness
the heat had increased and become even more oppressive; but rain was no longer out of the question, because, to judge from the shadows drifting across the skylight, the skies were clouding over
this was typical of herr ballerstedt’s classroom method

hans castorp could well imagine that was the case, without ever speaking to joachim

having grown up in the atmosphere of a bellicose, triumphant, and rejuvenated fatherland, they had embraced the habits of crude virility
this was followed by a grieg sonata—salon music of a nordic nature, which met with polite applause, even from the costumed and uncostumed patients seated now, bottles in ice-buckets at their sides, at the two bridge tables that had been set up
in the mixture of revolution and conspiracy that naphta had served up to his hearers, herr settembrini responded, the obscurantist element had predominated in a most unsavory fashion

in most energetic words, kant has demonstrated that this proof cannot stand up against reason any better than its fellows
frau permaneder was wearing a fur-trimmed shawl and a long, narrow felt hat with a veil
and so they treated him with a respect tinged with venom
then he stood up and closed the keyboard
what a sight: joachim recklessly indulging in conversation with high-breasted marusya, a person with whom he had never exchanged a single word during the whole time they had sat at the same table and at the mention of whose name he had always lowered his eyes and assumed a stern, reasonable, honor-loving expression, though his face had turned blotchy and pale
oh, he could find no peace in that, either
the consul slammed the door behind him
robust and spare—at least that’s the impression i got from him this morning at breakfast

his head buzzed with a gentle fever, and under the disquieting pressure of his upset stomach, his heartbeat was slow, strong, and irregular

it was the unconditional curiosity of the tourist thirsty for knowledge; a curiosity that, in having tasted the mystery of personality, had perhaps not been all that far from the realms emerging here; a curiosity that displayed something of a military character by not trying to evade something forbidden if it might offer itself
he loves me, she said, and his love makes me proud and grateful and devoted to him
it was a purely ascetic exercise, a part of the discipline of penitence, a means of salvation

in one case he added with some liberties,
we have them to thank that germany, france, and italy aren’t covered with primeval forests and swamps, but provide us with grain, fruit, and wine
the despot was dispatched by a knife, his mouth opened for a bellow that no one heard

the consul gravely shook his head

funny, is not it, how for a long time music saw itself as a means of redemption, and all the while, like all art, it needed redemption, that is, needed to be redeemed from a solemn isolation that was the fruit of culture's emoncipation, of the elevation of culture to ersatz religion-needed to be redeemed from being left alone with a cultured elite, known as the 'audience,  which will soon no longer exist, which already no longer exists, so that art will soon be all alone, alone to fade away and die, unless, that is, it should find a way to the volk, or to put it un-romantically, to human beings?

as far as his own office staff goes, i don’t think that they are especially devoted to him
it showed hans lorenz castorp in his official dress as a town councillor—the sober, even godly attire of citizens from a vanished century, a costume that later citizens, whether staid or dashing, had carried with them through the years, continuing to wear it on pompous occasions in order ceremoniously to make the past present, and the present past, and to proclaim the permanent continuity of all things and the venerable trustworthiness of their official signatures

this was just too horrible for poor hans castorp; in his dismay, he pressed his hand to his brow and simply forgot that he had a bite of pumpernickel and cheddar in his mouth, ready to be chewed and swallowed

one does not understand it, as a cultivated person one simply accepts it with objective respect for the law of nature
as such he had to pass on to him childish beginner's basics; but, with strange incongruity and on the side, so to speak, he had at the same time brought adrian into first contact with the greatest things, opening for him the realm of world literature, awakening his curiosity with presentations that lured him into the vast expanses of the russian, english, and french novel, encouraging him to study the lyric poetry of shelley and keats, holderlin and novalis, giving him manzoni and goethe, schopenhauer and meister eckehart to read
instead of gradually he said a little and a little; instead of i hope, it was i have good hope; and he never said anything but holy writ when referring to the bible

top hat in hand, he ran down the staircase on soft soles, and in a piercing whisper he called out across the entrance hall filled to overflowing with uniformed civil servants from the tax office and grain haulers in blouses, knee breeches, and top hats: the rooms are full, but there’s still a little space left along the corridor
at that moment—the carriage was rattling along breite strasse—matthiesen the grain hauler passed them and doffed his homely top hat with a deep sweep of his hand, and his gruff face was so full of respect it seemed to say, i swear i’m at the bottom of the ladder

herr wenzel—a small sturdy man with an intelligent face, a black mustache, and red hands—had shaved the consul that very morning, but here he was his equal

over the years her looks had grown a bit more common, but her narrow black eyes and those malaysian cheekbones were still attractive, and it was quite apparent that she must have been extraordinarily pretty at one time
all these things were much too high for herr ferge, however, and wehsal proved less interested once the subject was no longer flogging or torture
its concern is the parochial cosmology of kaisersaschern, which leads to astrology, to observation of the positions of the planets, of their constellation and auspicious or ruinous forecasts-which is only natural and right, for what is patently clear is the intimate interdependence of bodies, their mutual neighborly bearing upon one another, within such a closely knit group in one little corncr of the cosmos, like our solar system
she has been taken from us and is with god now, and from her deathbed she wrote, in pencil, with a trembling hand

hans castorp helped himself and smoked the unusually large, wide cigarette, imprinted with a golden sphinx—and it was indeed wonderful
there were moments when, as you played king, you saw the intimation of a dream of love rising up out of death and this carnal body

he will arrange for the oral cavity to be cleansed frequently with moistened linen cloths; as for medication, he will prescribe a mixture of iodine, iodide of potassium, quinine, and an antipyretic; and above all, since the stomach and intestines are seriously affected, he will prescribe a light but very nourishing diet
no one else did so in the castello house on the street of stairs

but gotthold thinks that as his stepmother i care only for my own children’s interests and am deliberately estranging his father from him
and if i don’t arrive just yet, it will be a good while before they even notice, you can be sure of that
hans castorp even showed a certain regard and consideration for joachim—not so much because he was an old-timer here and had served as his guide and cicerone in this world, but more particularly because there was no doubt that he was seriously ill but since this was how things were, it was only understandable if someone made as much of his case as possible, even exaggerated a little to be part of the aristocracy or at least get closer to it
they spoke in a jargon that was both slipshod and dashing and was replete with terms from technology
elisabeth had now stood up, and she walked toward him with her hands outstretched, her head tilted to one side

for there is one thing we must keep in mind: if philosophers and poets have finally put aside or dismissed some idea, some point of view, some principle, a king is sure to come along who has just discovered it, who believes it to be the latest and best idea, something he has to believe and act on
his pale eyes had faltered as those words spoken from the throes of lonely death crossed his ragged lips

you’re a man without sympathy, love, or humility
the lab is behind schedule
the answers, accompanied by enchanting gestures, that he provided to questions about his mother, his trip, his stopover in the big city of munich, had, as noted, a decided swiss lilt, and a good many dialect words were wrapped in the silvery timbre of his voice: cot instead of
bending over the instrument, he spread his arms wide as if to embrace it and suddenly, as if pushed, fell sideways from his chair to the floor
that won’t work, dear little anna
but whoever shaped the harmony could hardly be called free

her penchant for the whimsical and macabre amused the circle of gentlemen who paid her court
isn’t it grand, isn’t it good, that language has only one word for everything we associate with love—from utter sanctity to the most fleshly lust?

one day, in much the same mood, he stood leaning over the third-floor gallery, peering down into the bright, open stairwell, where everything was silent, and little johann came out of his room, down the steps of his balcony, and along the corridor, on his way to see ida jungmann about something

but if herr marcus asked some honest laborer, catch my drift?, it sounded so preposterous that his partner, who sat across the desk from him, would simply start laughing—a sign for the whole office to join in the mirth

elly was in her deep trance, her face resting in her tightly held hands, and herr wenzel was about to change records or turn one over, when our friend began to say, with some determination, that he had a suggestion to make—insignificant, really, but then it might be useful, in his opinion

there was an aura of nordic coolness about her, a glasslike chasteness, a virginal, childish quality that was quite attractive, as were both the full, pure look in her blue, childlike eyes and her pointed, refined way of speaking, in a slightly broken german with the typical mispronunciations of danes—like fleck for flesh
she first repeated, what does this mean, then slowly said, i believe that god made me, and quickly added, her face brightening, —and all creatures, and, suddenly finding the track smooth—she was unstoppable now and her face beamed with happiness—she rattled off the whole article, as prescribed by her catechism, newly revised and published under the auspices of an august and wise senate in this year of our lord,
the convivial mood continued, more music followed, but nothing that demanded their particular attention; people gathered with their drinks for dominoes and bridge, amused themselves with the optical gadgets, and stood chatting in little groups here and there
his opposition to jews was a cheerful obsession—this acquired hostility was the pride and content of his life
they let their voices sweep in unison to the blessed sustained note of the octave, secure in the belief that heaven was opening before them, that their longings were bathed in the light of eternity
and at the same time that christian is lying ill in hamburg

it is not for nothing that the place teems with mongolian muscovites—people like these

this was the first moribundus that hans castorp had ever seen in his life, inasmuch as both his parents and his grandfather had died behind his back, so to speak

his wife had been dead for years
it wasn’t that foolishness on the staircase at all
well, isn’t it cozy?
there is not a trace of traditional forms
schwerdtfeger was happy to agree, and his only regret was that he did not have much time, since he would have to be back at the station for the six o'clock train if he was not to miss the concert
she should have told them she was not suited for such games, because everything was whispered to her
he shuddered, but he played
he said, turning now to hans castorp
my loss of fluids today was considerable

do you know what?
so it’s jist a matter of which of them three’s gonna git the most votes, that it?
because if i stay behind up here alone—and that is what i’ll do if he leaves, it’s totally out of the question for me to go with him—then it will be—my heart’s standing absolutely still now—it will be for good and all, because i’ll never, ever find my way back to the flatlands alone
you take a bath, but that doesn’t help, your whole body feels sticky and grubby
placet experiri, hans castorp had the impudence to reply, and herr settembrini departed—and then, to be sure, once left to his own devices, the young man did not lay out his cards again, but sat for a long time at the table in his white room, his head propped in his hand, brooding, gripped by the horror of the eerie and skewed state in which he saw the world entrapped, by the fear of the grinning demon and monkey-god in whose crazed and unrestrained power he now found himself—and whose name was the great stupor
and now that a beginning had been made, he arranged an appointment that very day with sister alfreda to visit her patient, fritz rotbein, who like his nurse was terribly bored, even though, to judge by all the evidence, he had only a short time left
with a fanfare of trumpets and screechy clarinets the fortnightly sunday concert began, for which joachim had joined his cousin in his room, taking a seat out on the balcony to listen
she had raised one generation, and when they had outgrown her care, she had nursed and tended little johann, read him grimm’s fairy tales, and told him the story of her uncle who had died of the hiccups
he stood beside the middle row of desks, propping the palm of one hand on the first desktop and assuming his customary skewed stance
yes, well, he was bedridden for now, primarily because of the liquid diet he was on, which of course could not help affecting his energies
you do understand me, don’t you?
joachim raised seven fingers
the suit was filed—tony’s second suit of divorce—and in the early phases she followed it with high seriousness, great eagerness, and considerable knowledge of the law
a man of splendid poses …
hmm, hmm, isn’t that a pretty twist, a nasty twist, a hard fact to contradict all ideals
she received the two doctors, however, with lively interest and warmth and conferred with them at length
but to avoid annoying either man, he did not say this, and watched, wrapped in reservations, as they went at it, spitefully helping one another to get lost in a thousand trivialities, all because settembrini had made a little joke about virgil the latin poet
i have a graphic way of speaking, is what you want to say
the familiar blend of languor and excitement—which was the constant condition of a berghof guest whose acclimatization consisted of his getting used to not getting used to things—had grown so strong in both component parts that it was no longer even a question of his taking prudent action against such attacks
i am speaking here of a more or less secret and interior immobility, which could be perceived only by a very careful observer
because his dreams and fantasies had twice taken a turn to bring him back to life: once in horror, the second time out of joy
it was obvious that papa had been busy with them this morning, after second breakfast, and had left them there to work on them later
he had thought of music as his foe—but was music really such a serious problem?
you see, i am spreading my magic cloak
although there’s really no reason for you to be that way
it was long ago, we were taking a walk around the cattle trough, and the conversation was about music
a moment of your time, thomas
ah yes, our carnival festivities are over
he was in his fifteenth year when i discovered it
the music profession was represented not only by the opera singers, but also by ferdinand edschmidt, the conductor of the zapfenstosser orchestra
after tony had repeated several times her conviction that she would return home for a visit very soon and that her parents would not be long in making a trip to hamburg, either, she climbed blithely into the coach and let her mother carefully tuck the warm fur blanket around her
this was the manor house, the residence of kai’s father, count eberhard mölln
but it looks as if it’s not to be
herr brecht did as he was asked, and then responded, it would be perfectly fine with me, senator buddenbrook, if you came by any time tomorrow or the day after
doctor mantelsack said, staring at him with bulging, sapphire-blue eyes that sparkled behind his thick glasses
he returned home and was received with open arms by his family—not just uncles, but a mother and a wife
oh, go ahead and smoke
how long it has been since the undersigned was last permitted a glimpse of that most enchanting of faces
i salute reason, settembrini replied
and in that same gruff, reverberating voice he was now telling dubious anecdotes, spiced with dialect idioms
what do you do if a woman clings to you as if she were drowning and is determined to make you her lover?
and i truly was
for i felt as if a relieved ah, yes !
he: ah, ah, sweet innocence!
the lobby lay in semidarkness
he’s just arrived from hamburg
all right—i’ll give you an answer
these people may have poured a great deal of water into wine that was once quite heady, but the concept of brotherhood is itself strong enough to tolerate a lot of water
when i wake up i look forward to being able to smoke all day, and when i eat, i look forward to it again, in fact i can honestly say that i actually only eat so that i can smoke, although that’s an exaggeration, of course
as you see, his chair is empty
julie, a girl with big bright black eyes and shoulders that she carried a little high, lived in the next villa, which was entirely overgrown with grapevines
a man of just barely average height strode between them in some haste; he tipped his hat slightly and raised one pale eyebrow—the tips of his long mustache extended out beyond his pallid cheeks
you had me all confused this morning
after a while he took the thermometer out of his mouth, looked at it, and said, yes, when you pay close attention to it—time, i mean—it goes very slowly
at dinner herr arnoldsen gave one of his very witty toasts in honor of the two engaged couples, and later, as they drank coffee, he played the violin like a gypsy, with savage passion and dexterity
the head nurse asked now, trying to fix her eyes in a piercing stare—but did not succeed, since they began to wander
these, then, were adrian's first guests in pfeiffering
will it stop before then, stop in time to keep me from passing on even more?
the medium, dr krokowski noted, continuing an introduction evidently addressed in particular to hans castorp, no longer needed to be put into a trance by the attending physician
for example: as he is about to enter the dining hall, hans castorp realizes that the object of his dreams is behind him
do give me a timbre-poste
none of his trembling underlings knew how to behave in his presence
his fixation, though calamitous, resulted in his leaving that locale after his voluntary second visit the same man he was after his involuntary first one, but not without his having determined the address of the female who had touched him
melancholy hung like a cloud over them, because both were steadily losing vital products of metabolism—herr magnus, sugar; frau magnus, protein
herr ferge said, and took the freedom of recalling the laughter that had burst from him as he had blacked out
but it had not been old castorp’s fault, god knows, that the modern spirit had enjoyed its celebrated, brilliant victories
i shall sit in my room with my daughter and my granddaughter, and i shall turn the key and forbid him to enter—i swear i shall
degrees, he was seriously ill but he led such a reckless life that he deserved to have his ears boxed
he says that he’s less healthy than i what?
but his permutations would probably have prevented it as well, and to that extent his permutations and his moist spot go together, so to speak
if i understood correctly, he referred frequently to hell and to a most indelicate pain
right here on the spot, if you’d like
who knows still today, who knew even in classic times, what inspiration, what genuine, ancient, primal enthusiasm is, enthusiasm ne'er sicklied o'er with criticism, lame prudence, and the deadly reins of reason-what holy rapture is?
it was madame chauchat, he realized with something like indignation
yes, for you and your wines, köppen!
my sentence, my final sentence has been spoken—and it is life
the simple fact that they do fight, naphta retorted, remains an obvious characteristic of the profession, on that much we can agree
it was thursday, the day on which the family regularly gathered every other week; but today, along with relatives who lived in the city, a few good friends of the family had been invited to share a simple dinner, and so they sat in the waning light of evening—the clock was approaching four—awaiting their guests
but wait, hans castorp said, holding up a forefinger next to one bloodshot eye
a belief in absolute values, however illusionary, remains for me a prerequisite of life
gentlemen, with which of you might i discuss this matter?
his had been an exceptionally dangerous pleural shock, a total collapse, an alarming swoon—in a word, so severe that the operation had to be broken off and postponed for now
aristotle shifted the reality of universal ideas to the individual
very simple and understandable, herr leverkiihn, i saw it right off
he frequently called frau schweigestill on the telephone to inquire about how he was doing and offered to pay a visit as soon as adrian could tolerate it as a welcome diversion
asked james, who was shivering despite the inch-thick fabric of his coat; and if there was something both hurried and halting about the way he put his question, it was because his teeth were very close to chattering
it doesn’t matter to the bodies
at the same moment, however, christian opened the door and entered
i can recall as if it were yesterday leaving the lecture and walking home with adrian
can that ever be honorable?
i’m on my way to see brecht
and so time passed—weeks, three or four probably, that at least is our guess, since we cannot possibly depend on hans castorp’s judgment and ability to gauge such matters
which is why our venerable head nurse has taken charge of his supply and allows him only a small daily ration
so this was how things had been destined to turn out for hanno
the bare skin had obviously been painted with feeling, and despite a certain aura of sweetness, the artist had been able to endow it with scientific reality and lifelike accuracy
the necessity of saving her soul from eternal damnation, of snatching her from the claws of the devil by sacrificing her body, was perfectly obvious
with remarkable ease and clarity i can still recall today the picture of a gaunt french woman standing on a hill around which our battery was moving and beneath which a bombarded village still smoldered
it was ages now since he first began to practice here—on his own at first, quickly making a name for himself as both a specialist with a fine ear for auscultation and a surehanded lung surgeon
behrens knows how to deal with them, he can strike just the right tone for such cases
why shouldn’t he enjoy spending some time with our visitors?
you’re not trying to tell me that it’s going to snow now?
i do not see myself in a position to alter that
apparently he was concerned above all with the case's progressing clearly through each of its distinctive stages
then i said that i wanted to visit our patient
i suppose that could apply as well to your sham game of bridge
can’t tell you where she picked him up, he declared
you should go there, senator, and sit on the beach for a while
someone lifted the glass bell from a soft swiss cheese and cut off a piece; what was more, a bowl of fruit, both fresh and dried, stood in the middle of the table
i’m lying there with my face covered so i can’t see anything, and the assistant is holding me on the right and the head nurse on the left
but a hit, a hit indeed
it is the directness, the courage, and the depth of one's personal life, the will and ability to experience and live out in its full vitality that natural and demonic element of existence of which kierkegaard has again made us aware
my conviction that the intellect can be certain that in doing what most disconcerts the crowd, in pursuing the most daring, unconventional advances and explorations, it will in some highly indirect fashion serve man-and in the long run, all men
settembrini was about to reply, when he was interrupted by the racket of loud laughter coming from the lobby
no, no, he said, you’re mistaken, my case is the most harmless imaginable
it fills a few hours up so nice and properly, i think
you are right, she replied, a delicate blush suffusing her face
it was italy on which he decided and for which he set out toward the end of june, just as summer had begun-an unusual time of year for a tourist
it isn’t your husband at all
he came down brämenbühl, following along the edge of the forest, and was in dorf by half past five; he stored his equipment at the grocer’s, rested a bit in herr settembrini’s garret, and gave him a full report of how he had been overtaken by the snowstorm
do you remember, tony, he went on, slipping his arm under his sister’s and lowering his voice even more, when hanno was christened, how you said to me, it’s as if a whole new era is beginning’?
a wave of misery swept over him—it seemed as if he had never felt this miserable in all his life
any change in these shameful conditions, to which custom and ignorance had rendered these people insensible-the indescribable filth of the village street, for instance, or the total lack of hygiene in their hovels-would surely have been a revolutionary act that no single person, least of all a woman, would dare undertake
slick as a whistle, even without a mirror
and what was a week, when you stopped to consider?
it had been devoured by the resort spreading relentlessly toward the entrance to the valley, and that part of the settlement called davos-dorf merged imperceptibly, without transition, into what was called davos-platz
and there was that name—if only i knew what the name was that he called her
he shouted amid well-deserved laughter
and it happened that two friends, both musicians, came to visit him one afternoon, and no sooner had they entered the house than they heard shocking news
no, tom, it won’t turn out all right—i don’t believe that
they were very busy in there—you could hear the director’s voice giving orders
and with a sob of helpless rage, frau permaneder sank down onto an armchair that was covered in oilcloth and stood right next to her
after the death of her husband (an earnest portrait of whom, dressed in official robes, likewise decorated the salon), with her circumstances sharply reduced and no longer permitting her to maintain quite the same position in her accustomed milieu, she had felt free to follow the wishes of an as yet barely tapped and presumably insatiable lust for life and had directed them toward an interesting postlude in warmer, more humane surroundings
she wept and shook her head
is the recording here?
and so they came to an understanding; and as chance would have it, upon their arrival at the sanatorium they ran into director behrens himself and took the opportunity to present their request on the spot
the atmosphere is so international
the consul remarked, turning from one to the other
the invisible person sang:
and then, in a fit of defiance, he gave himself another five—he just wanted to close his eyes a little
fine, simply longer, then
petersen translated, casting a glance now and then at the right-hand page in his book, which had nothing to do with the passage
and judging from that, it appears that under confusing conditions, man in his helplessness tends to experience time in a greatly diminished form rather than to overestimate it
custom myself to your impudence that you use the familiar pronoun and call me
the lady in front of him did turn her head as he sat down, studying him with her narrow eyes
he had no reply
give me the book, the professor repeated and stamped one foot
and they heard him say: ah, yes, yes, yes—agreed
he asked as they left the building
until behrens discharged him as cured—in earnest, not like today
she is hurrying through the rain without a hat, has barely managed to toss a shawl over her shoulders, stumbling more than walking, her coiffure in total dishevelment
she went down to the ground floor and demanded to see thomas in his private office
so there’ll be two of you tomorrow, right after you’ve put on the feed bag
standing right in front of her!
and you haven’t eaten at mine, my friend?
perhaps it’s you who has to endure torments, indescribable torments, all over your body after every little distraction
with herr settembrini looking on and playing the critical expert, although he knew absolutely nothing about sports, hans castorp purchased a pair of spiffing skis in a specialty shop on the main street—good solid ash, shellacked a light brown, with first-rate leather straps and pointed tips turned up slightly; he also bought poles with iron tips and snow rings, and could not be talked out of carrying it all on his shoulder to settembrini’s quarters, where he quickly came to an agreement with the grocer about storage for his equipment
on the whole he was more in the mood for laughter and foolishness than for metaphysical conversations
the longer, the less will you be able and willing to condescend to contritio, inasmuch as the extravagant existence that you will lead is a great pampering, from which willy-nilly one does not find a way back to wholesome mediocrity
and of all things—hans castorp didn’t know!
would l u d
your mother and i did, however, take a trip to hamburg in the middle of june to visit your sister tony
but since then, gentlemen, absolutely no other type of educator has ever emerged
but although the sound of the instruments, the confusion of voices, and the sight of all these people jangled on his nerves and merged with memories of the past and his father, calling up a faint wave of emotion, the predominant feeling was a sense that the whole affair was absurd and embarrassing—second-rate music distorted by bad acoustics, banal people engaging in banal conversation about stock prices and banquets
and that was what made one sad
clavdia raised her head this time as the young man approached the bed again
what joachim had said about his cheeks proved to be the absolute truth—they were purple, making his head look that much more colorful against his belted, white surgical smock, which fell just below the knees, revealing striped trousers and colossal feet in a pair of yellow, rather worn, laced boots
in this case it might have been a music box that he longed to see
the harmonies of the orchestra picked up the easy strains and bore them on—and it was simply ravishing the way the whole ensemble repeated it now in a sweeping tutti
at the appropriate time, the gong rang out
just recently, for example
as to his career at school, he did indeed have to repeat a class or two
i even saw one once—he had iron-gray whiskers and such a red face
adrian, however, presented the singular phenomenon of a poor student as head of the class
only one lady preferred to faint quietly
but i will not kill, you may be assured of that
because she’s definitely not named katyenka or ninotchka
but you should know that i don’t rank very high on the fever chart—which is to say, i had almost none, really, until recently
the director said, pressing him again
mesdames et messieurs, i hope you have enjoyed your meal
he could no longer control it
and then across from me sits a poor creature with graveyard blossoms on her cheeks, an old maid from transylvania, who goes on endlessly about her brother-in-law,  a gentleman whom no one knows, nor wishes to know
there are quite enough solid though financially straitened firms in hamburg, or wherever, that could use a new flow of capital and would take you on as a partner
the human race had come out of darkness, fear, and hate, but now it was moving forward and upward along a shining road toward a final state of understanding, inner illumination, goodness, and happiness—and technology was the most useful vehicle for traveling that road
well, it was rather hard, clavdia, even for a man with detached passions—hard on me and hard-hearted of you to come back with him, because of course you knew from behrens that i was still here, waiting for you
then, while gerda was searching for some music, her violin under her arm, the most startling thing happened: herr pfühl, edmund pfühl, the organist of st mary’s, who had been playing a casual interlude, gradually drifted into a very strange style, while a kind of embarrassed joy lit his faraway gaze
don’t go too far, now, tony
no, we must sell, sell!
her hair was black, smooth, and freshly put up in a large-meshed net
settembrini sat off to one side for a while, but he also vanished, after first making a few graphic, taut comments about the local’s tedious bel canto and adding a satirical remark about how delightful it was that they were all so cozy and snug here together this evening
all the same, he could definitely see that he had a gentleman before him—the refined expression on the stranger’s face, his easy, even handsome pose left no doubt of that
there is much that we might say about dignity or the lack thereof, naphta replied
the fact is, as we know—permit me to say—fine!
likewise playing a role was his own spiritual need to take suffering and death seriously, to pay attention to them, a need he hoped would be nourished and satisfied by his getting closer to the seriously ill and dying, as a way of counteracting the numerous rebuffs such a need received daily, even hourly, wherever he turned—including some of settembrini’s insulting pronouncements, which only reinforced his own craving
life was hard, and business, as it took its ruthless, unsentimental course, was the epitome of life in general
my god, little schwerdtfeger!
it is a piercing pain that has something degrading about it, as does all pain, and is such a shock to the nervous system that it takes one’s breath away and can make a grown man weep bitter tears
a rather pointless story, really, now that i think of it
yes, it’s been known to happen
but, as was noted earlier, gerda buddenbrook had no sooner appeared in town than she was spotted by the gloomy broker, whose roving eye was ever on the lookout for something extraordinary
the honor of the scholastics will be vindicated in this regard as well, if i am not mistaken
and yet what befuddlement compelled him to make preparations of such monstrous significance?
before separating, they stood for a while in the fenced-in area out front, forming their own little group, while a few patients loitering at the main entrance watched them as they talked
perhaps he can be no quicker, given his wretched means
surely you’re in error there, aren’t you?
it was herr settembrini, who lived one floor up and just happened to drop by to keep these gentlemen company
first tell me what freedom is, he went on in normal tones
then he sat down again—and it was true, buddenbrook had laughed at kai’s joke, was seized by a fit of stifled, violent laughter that he could not control
all the same, schleppfuss said, this opened up the problem of the absolutely good and beautiful, of the good and beautiful with no
i am well aware that there are those who enjoy pointing to the apolitical origins of masonic thought
they lie with their faces in the mire and do not stir
it was certainly no enthusiastic portrait that he provided me; on the contrary, his voice was low and casual, his expression impassive, his glance directed elsewhere in the room
he thought about kai and seeing him again, and about herr pfühl and his music lessons, about his grand piano and harmonium
so director behrens is also an expert on cigars, i see
the flesh-to retain the christian term-is normally repulsed by everything except itself
he was manifestly, indiscriminately in love with each and every female in sight—without respect of person
all alone and very busy, hans castorp sorted and arranged, surrendering a small number of the disks to the instrument, which awakened them to sonorous life
taking the upper end of tiirken strasse, i quickly reached ludwig strasse and followed that quite monumental highway (to be sure, it has been paved with asphalt for years now) on the left side, in the direction of the victory gate
as if at ease!
i previously noted of my own accord that there was a lively sense that the war had disrupted and destroyed what had seemed to be life's fixed values-particularly in the defeated nations, which in that sense had something like an intellectual head start over the others
and hanno was thrilled, just as he was every year, and managed with only one or two almost involuntary, nervous sobs to say the lord’s prayer, and was permitted to reach into the sack for good children—which, as always, the old man once again forgot to take with him as he left
binding them all under his spell and calling them back to his service, he lowered the tip of his forefinger to the tip of his thumb and let the other long nails stand erect at one side
i certainly wasn’t thinking at the time of a moist spot, my intentions were quite different, more general, more philosophical
cheap construction, naturally, shamefully cheap!
oh, so you’re leaving us in the lurch, are you, edgar?
but what did he do?
it seems to me, however, that despite the logical, moral rigor music may appear to display, it belongs to a world of spirits, for whose absolute reliability in matters of human reason and dignity i would not exactly want to put my hand in the fire
time is active, by nature it is much like a verb, it both ripens and brings forth
i find it absolutely impossible to describe the tone of ardor and melancholy, but also of uneasy satisfaction that this mixing of the concepts of worth and desire took on when coming from her mouth, or to describe the way desire formed the essential element inside worth's envelope of lovableness, which had to be taken away, ripped away, so that worth might be had all alone, utterly alone, alone in the ultimate sense of the word
for the sake of the family, they were required under all circumstances to preserve this life as long as possible, and a narcotic would have meant the immediate loss of all resistance, the surrender of life
and then the endmg goes: a puppy dog and no one else,
half-drowned by the music, the talk would break off and start up again, its life sustained artificially
from i r s t
as infatuated as you undeniably are, you must surely know her first name
you only have to just touch the blade, and it goes right into the flesh as if it were butter
her tears had stopped, and compassion and pity welled up within her
(the contract arrived the very next day from the hotel bayerischer hof in munich)
and she’s the second maid already
and recently, if the gentlemen could believe it, when she returned from having gone out for just a moment, merely to purchase some tooth powder, she found her patient sitting up in bed, with a glass of dark, heavy beer, a salami, a piece of coarse rye bread, and a pickle, all spread out before him
he pulled the thermometer from his mouth, more violently than he had ever done before, except for that first time, the day the head nurse had sold him this dainty gadget, and he gazed down at it with the same eagerness as he had then
rudiger of the same-colored eyes did not in the least share my apprehension-which i kept very much to myself, by the way, and which did not prevent my joining sincerely in these merry moods whenever they happened to occur
i had a long talk with herr grünlich yesterday morning—he is indeed a most insistent suitor—and i saw his books, he spread them out for me himself
and now in point of fact it was i who shouted and in my outrage forbade such talk
naphta, who had taken his tea here, had ordered wine and cake, apparently a reminiscence of his student days; joachim frequently moistened his sore throat with real lemonade, which he drank very strong and sour, for its astringent, soothing effect; and settembrini was enjoying simple sugared water, but drank it through a straw in a very charming, appetizing way, as if sipping the most costly of beverages
granted, his punctuality in such matters left much to be desired
and his assurances did turn out, for the most part, as predicted
he let go and walked on
but was he over it now?
this bestial sinner first abase,
she was resting against her silk pillows, an elbow on one knee, her chin in her hand, her head sunk low—but she let her eyes drift up, dreamily scanning the room
good god, well, gentlemen?
yes, his spirit, his zealous theory violated life itself, and whoever wanted to destroy passions wanted nothingness, pure nothingness—pure indeed, since pure was the only attribute that could still be attached to nothingness
but, feeling guilty, he immediately corrected himself: i certainly would not force you to do so, my dear tony
the regular schedule, with its weekly and fortnightly deviations, took its course
praeterit figura huius mundi, he said to himself in a latin that was not humanist in spirit, but a phrase he had picked up from naphta
hans castorp turned away to watch the preparations for taking joachim’s interior portrait
herr permaneder refrained from any comment that might have confirmed an imminent departure and instead devoted himself to the vast array of delicacies on the table—certainly not the daily fare below the danube
in the winged-victory room, rosa schneidewein was served coffee, the lad milk and cake
i have more serious things to think about than your ailments
music drama had taken its stuff from romantic sagas, from the world of medieval myth, and had insinuated that only such subjects were worthy of music, compatible
good afternoon, he said
but the thing was, as he told joachim one day, you began with annoyance and distaste, and suddenly something quite different comes up that has nothing whatever to do with forming opinions and then it was all over with such rigor—and suddenly you were no longer receptive to pedagogic influences of the republican and eloquent sort
and now as he dreamed on, it seemed to him that he was in the same schoolyard where he had spent his recesses for so many years, and he was just about to borrow a drawing pencil from madame chauchat, who also happened to be present
rotbein whispered all this in a very businesslike voice, viewing even the operation itself as a matter of business—as long as he lived he would regard things from that point of view
but although he had a fever that sunday and was feeling very weak, he insisted, in spite of his doctor's warnings, on attending his landlord's funeral service, which was held in the village church at pfeiffering and drew a crowd of people from all over the district
by which i mean that it’s all too new yet
i really can’t imagine it
but it had just come to him, insinuating itself all on its own
it was indeed rather odd to hear a lecture about love, since the lectures he usually attended were about things like gear transmissions in ships
i do not quite understand, my dear fellow
his morbid fantasies and fixations had grown worse, and more frequent, and at the urging of his wife and a physician he had entered a sanatorium
the senator donned his mackintosh and galoshes and took long walks with gosch the broker; christian sat in the pastry shop with the girl who tended the counter and served him brandy smashes
that’s an open question
frau chauchat and the five gentlemen clustered behind mynheer peeperkorn, and together they all stared at the surging waters
hans castorp looked up through his tears
sitting up straight, thrown back against the cabriolet’s hard cushions, they crossed the brook and then the narrow tracks, following the street running alongside them and faced by an irregular pattern of buildings, and halted now on the gravel apron in front of the dorf railroad station, which was not much more than a shed
but in that stretched and bent position and still holding the napkin by one corner, she scowls, evidently annoyed at her unreasonable little burst of panic, for which she apparently blames him
he also showed me a letter that the man had written while still engaged in his punctilious task and in which he disclosed, in a most intelligent fashion, a kind of worried enthusiasm for the object of his painful endeavor
i even find it quite appropriate for us to gather together beforehand, in silent prayer, as it were
and so ever forth, that i engaged in villainous rivalry with the goodness on high as to which were more inexhaustible, it or my speculating-there you see that i am damned, and there is no mercy for me, because i destroy any such aforehand through speculation
silver-white, rounded clouds drifted in the deep blue sky above the delicate symmetry of the garden
the things that hanno and kai talked about were strangely out of place here, but were drowned out in the babble of voices that filled the cold, damp air
dr mantelsack prompted him, prompted him a second time in a sharper tone; the third time he was downright indignant; and when mumme got stuck for good, the professor erupted in fierce anger
but he did explore all the feelings that intoxication and passion can explore once they catch a glimpse of themselves in the world outside, feelings that are the strangest mixture of disgust and shared emotions
lebrecht kröger, the cavalier à la mode, had joined his fathers
he nodded again when hans castorp finished his critical remarks for now and fell silent
how long, to set joachim aside for now, had frau chauchat not been present?
heard had so totally excluded
alarmed, i went to him
there must be an end to it
he eased off the bellows, pulled his hands from the manuals, and laughed with a blush
you need to get involved in the matter yourself, herr buddenbrook
his thoughts were few; he merely looked back steadily, with a gentle shake of his head, at his life and at life in general, which suddenly seemed so distant and strange—all that unnecessary, noisy hustle and bustle, in whose midst he had stood, and which now was imperceptibly drawing away from him, a distant echo to which he turned an amazed ear
in its very boundlessness, dr krokowski’s theme recalled an enterprise to which settembrini was devoting his labor, the encyclopedia of suffering; and like that project, it proved equally rich in its applications—as witnessed by the lecturer’s recent digression into botany, or more precisely, fungi
he’s certainly different from your pastors
thus one finds the deeply drawn sigh at such words as, ah, faustus, thou desperate and unworthy heart, ah, ah, reason, mischief, presumption, and free will
but permaneder’s not like that, you see
you’re here so late?
there’ll just be a quick downpour—not even a strong wind
herr grünlich went on blinking with increasing suspicion
but when he saw the calm, uncomprehending smile with which his nephew responded to his jokes, the way it perfectly mirrored this whole community’s intact self-assurance, he took alarm; and fearing the loss of his business energies, he quickly concluded that he would have that decisive conversation with the director about his nephew at once—that very afternoon if at all possible—while he still had a spirit of his own and energies from the world below with which to attack, for he could feel those energies vanishing and the spirit of the place joining forces with his own good breeding in a dangerous alliance against them
what are we up to here?-but even as i put on such airs, i found myself utterly ridiculous; and the thing was that he noticed as much, obviously shared the feeling flooding through me, and in his embarrassment for me lowered his little head and pulled down the corners of his mouth like someone trying to suppress a laugh, which so completely undid me that for a long while i said absolutely nothing more
indeed it seemed to me that everything he had said bore the stamp of pain, stood under its sign, however brilliant and worthy of consideration it might be
they moved along the flagstone-paved hallway toward the rear, passing the kitchen on their right, went through a glass door, and stepped down two steps into the pretty and fragrant flower garden
her cheeks were flushed, she kept up a constant flow of chatter—in russian, presumably—while someone tucked a fur blanket around her legs
and according to one branch of science, whose notions of reality were equally unflattering and lurid, the embryo’s development seemed to be a hasty recapitulation of zoological genealogy
maitre,  he said, i understand perfectly how attached you must be to the stylish seclusion of the place you have chosen to reside-oh, i have seen it all, the hill, the pond, the village with its little church, et puis, cette maison pleine de dignite avec son htesse maternelle et vigoureuse
but although he carried on most dreadfully—slowly, inch by inch, she won him over by practice and persuasion
i’m sure you have no objection
thomas buddenbrook had joined stephan kistenmaker, senator gieseke, and voigt the architect at the back of the stairwell, between the door opening onto the smoking room and the flight of stairs to the third floor
he got off at the railroad crossing, offered some money without bothering to look if it was too much or too little, and lurched headlong up the loop of the drive
it was three o’clock in the afternoon
that may be strong language, but that’s how it was
in the last few days the bai:tle for odessa raged with heavy losses, but in the end that famous city on the black sea fell into the hands of the russiansthough, to be sure, without the enemy's having been able to disrupt our tactical regrouping
it had been a prank, a rather brash one, and in joachim’s eyes there was probably a trace of treachery and malice about it—hans castorp was well aware of that
we’ll speak of herr grünlich later, all right?
where previously, by yielding just slightly, he had not found it easy to separate the now of today from that of yesterday, or the day before yesterday, or the day before that, when all were alike as peas in a pod, of late that same now was apt, even likely, to muddle its present with a present that had prevailed a month or a year before, and to fuse into an always
it was a strong, warm baritone, and its song was in three parts, consisting of a frame of two closely related stanzas, quite religious in nature, almost in the style of a protestant chorale, and a middle stanza that had a gallant, chivalresque spirit, warlike, lighthearted, but equally devout—which was what gave it such a french military feel
to be brief: the traditional cash dowry for a young woman from our family is seventy thousand marks
it must have brought deep confusion to his soul for him to watch his qvalier's conservatism be trumped with the dreadfully clever card of atavism, with a radicalism of preservation that had about it nothing of the cavalier, but something more revolutionary and that sounded more destructive than any sort of liberalism, but all the same had, as if in mockery, a laudable conservative appeal- could imagine the sleepless night it would probably give him, although that may have been taking my sympathy too far
/: i came upon them in the street directory
was simply gossamer skirts, dancers tripping past on pointe, arms arched  gracefully above their heads-before the eyes of court society in their loges, maintaining the ideal and tabooing anything ugly and problematical, while a bridled bourgeoisie sat in orchestra seats below
he could speak quite naturally with them in their plattdeutsch, and still maintain an unapproachable distance
and then the engagement and our house in eimsbüttel—it was elegant, ida
he begged her to understand that this same sense of responsibility had strongly contributed to his willingness to carry out adrian's wish
we’ll be having bratwurst
the fact was that christian was now master of his own time more than ever; because of his precarious health, he had felt it necessary to give up his last commercial venture as an agent for champagne and cognac
such were her prospects, and no others would ever open before her
and to what, i ask you, would mere experimentation with harmony have led?
he denied by the way that he felt embarrassed by the comparison
that’s why i keep it locked up, you know
good god, chance could work wonders
christian is terribly indiscreet—it’s hard to put it in words
and the second godparent?
it was partly for the sake of that feeling that he had contrived to have this abiding, mutable heirloom shown to him
and you do love him very much, don’t you?
and she sailed away with her shoulders held high, her head tossed back, and her chin pressed lightly to her chest
i would often find him pursuing such studies or writing out instrumentations
it would have pained and embarrassed them, would have shaken their belief in human perfectibility, to have met with silence from adolf todtenhaupt
his chin dropped in a straight line to join his narrow white necktie—the goiterous neck could never have endured a stiff high collar
herr settembrini was forced to limit his contribution to the organization of progress to oral reports, and he would have had to have forgone even those had it not been for the opportunity offered by hans castorp’s friendly visits
what’s got into you?
oh, heaven forbid, tony cried, and there was sudden outrage even in the oh
you mean the strapping deutschlin, i said, and a fellow whose name was dungersheim
what i mean is, whenever you as a homo humanus were explaining things to me—because i didn’t have all that much to contribute, of course, given my previous inexperience, and could only feel that everything you said was well worth listening to
but the strong odor of alcohol pervading the room now only whipped her frenzy to a peak
you do understand that, don’t you?
which was why he was sent to investigate each factory on some pretext or other, and report back to his bank, so that they could have time to prevent serious losses by reinsuring or spreading the risk
the audience obeyed fairly promptly
it is the end of all morality in the arts
my name is permaneder, alois permaneder, from munich
let’s turn off a little
even frau chauchat laughed very hard at this performance, so that her mouth stood open and her eyes drew close together, exactly like pribislav hippe’s whenever he laughed—or so it seemed to hans castorp
well, and how about you?
she’s so healthy … so healthy
and hans tumbled with them
two or three weeks can set a great many things to rights
if your cousin leaves now, and you can tell him this for me, it may very well happen that you’ll still be here to witness his solemn return
things would remain the way they were now—with no real worries, but limited and far from elegant—and they would never change for the rest of her life
and he had determined that his cousin, or rather, anyone just in general would need, all things considered, twelve thousand francs a year here
he was delicate and nervous, suffering from weakness in the sympathetic nerves of the solar plexus, which is the source of so many anxieties and forebodings of early death, and he was a regular at a sanatorium for the wealthy in meran
it comes from a different intellectual direction—from the other one
the composer had provided these elusively scandalous verses with very simple harmonies, which in comparison to the musical language of the whole seemed more ragged, more eerie and false than the most audacious dissonances, and which in fact ·allowed the triad to come to monstrous fruition
his pillows stuffed behind his back, he wrote on sanatorium stationery about how his scheduled departure had been delayed
do you understand me, tony?
and in the next moment she bent forward and began to count the prune pits on her brother’s dessert plate
but, then, you have none
five times a day, the diners at all seven tables expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with this year’s winter
not one of life’s insults or compliments had ever left her at a loss for words
in his case, of course, it surely wasn’t anything like that—just the usual fever that went with the sniffles, people would have said down below
you have there the spinal sac, a pulsing column of liquor within, reaching to cerebral regions, to the meninx, in whose tissue the furtive venereal meningitis goes about its soft, silent work
a nature like adrian's does not have much soul
i shall make a note of it
they said nothing further about their visit with lauro, and even in the quiet of their own rooms, they refrained from judging his behavior
ah yes, life is dying—there’s no sense in trying to sugarcoat it—une destruction organique, as some frenchman once called it in that flippant way the frenchies have
the women circumspectly crowded forward to shake the hands of frau permaneder and her daughter, and with downcast eyes they mumbled what must be mumbled on such occasions; meanwhile the gentlemen moved toward the stairs and their waiting carriages
the hair and the nails keep on growing, and for that matter, in terms of the chemistry and physics, or so i’ve heard, it’s a regular hustle and bustle there inside
oh, tom, i’m afraid she’s adamant
the consul had at first paid no particular attention to a certain frau redisch, the polish industrialist’s wife, who sat at the same table as the gluttonous student with the circular glasses and the temporarily absent frau salomon; and indeed she was only one of many ladies who took their rest cure in the common lounging area—a rather plump and buxom brunette, no longer all that young, graying already, but with a dainty double chin and lively brown eyes
but, after all, life is like that, you know
and as far as greeting goes, you weren’t all that much more accommodating, my dear
sebastian bach, dear madam!
all day a horse led by a man at its halter pulled a heavy stone snow-roller through the streets of the resort below; and what looked like an old-fashioned postal carriage on runners, with a plow mounted up front to push great masses of white to each side, commuted between the resort and davos-dorf, as the settlement to the north was known
ah, that clarissa had to do him the favor!
from the first moment, it was armgard who made the greatest impression on tony, and that was because armgard was the first girl she had ever actually known from a noble family
at the worst, twenty-eight
and i’m supposed to picture our clearheaded herr settembrini mixed up with all that?
it came to the middle section with the bouncing rhythm, the passage about battle and danger—gallant, devout, and french
sometimes he would swallow hard, as if his mouth were full of liquid, and they could tell from the muscles of his cheeks and temples that he was holding his jaw clenched tight
his was a counterforce that they all could feel, but of which he was surely not even aware, or aware to god only knew what extent; but its weight was of no use to either argument, so that the issue itself seemed to pale, to lose its critical importance, indeed—though we hesitate to say it—to take on the stamp of frivolity
he later took up composing
i’m sorry i can’t spend more time with you, but i really must look after lunch
things up here, he said with a forced smile, are different from what is usual elsewhere
in his dream he saw the turntable whirling around its spindle, so fast it became invisible, inaudible, not simply rotating wildly in place, but moving in a strange lateral undulation so that the arm beneath which it turned began to oscillate supplely, as if it were breathing—very useful, one might suppose, for the vibrato and portamento of strings and human voices
the man had an obvious limp, and so the first thing that hans castorp asked joachim ziemssen was, is he a war veteran?
he was still wearing the same gray, petersham coat and pastel checked trousers
she dismissed the young men with her thanks, and her mood was now imposingly serene, given her anguished situation—in particular the stiff bill for oxygen her spouse had left her
she certainly did not want to be unfair to city folk, though, either; there were always exceptions, hidden exceptions maybe, and director stiglmayer, to take him again, had shown a lot of understanding, and she did not mean just the artistic sort, when he bought that gloomy painting
but i am not insulting you, herr grünlich, tony said, now regretting that she had lost her temper
marie would then nod amiably back at her, evidently glad that her aunt was amusing herself so well, and her eyes rested with a certain grateful acknowledgement on the man dispensing this mirth, who apparently was making it his business to tickle the old woman's urge to pass on one joke after another
any symptom of illness was a masked form of love in action, and illness was merely transformed love
he must have acted under the pressure of implacable necessity
and you still have your family—gerda and me and the buddenbrooks from breite strasse and the krögers, even mademoiselle weichbrodt, not to speak of klothilde, although i’m not sure whether she still enjoys our company
no sooner had the director departed than people sat down at the card tables
standing side by side, they gazed down the wet green slope and across the narrow, rocky band of beach to the troubled, tossing sea
the man has but one thought in his head, and it is a filthy one
settembrini came over in person now, coffee cup in hand, a toothpick between his lips, and made himself at home between hans castorp and the teacher
ah, where is there such a god as thou art, lord of sabaoth, thou who helpest in all dangers and afflictions, and who teachest us to know thy will aright, that we may fear thee and be found faithful to thy will and commandments!
consul buddenbrook strode hurriedly across his extensive property
eighty thousand went to frankfurt as a dowry, and , was spent setting up gotthold in business: which leaves ,
and yet my heart quailed at the naivete of that belief, which i was inclined to see as an expression of the loneliness and detachment that formed the aura around him and that led me reluctantly to doubt whether this man was made to attract
and so the director scoped, mirrored, and gazed deep and long down joachim’s throat; immediately afterward, the patient appeared on hans castorp’s balcony, as explicitly requested, to give a report
when he would stop—not moving a muscle, so that he could not hear even himself—the silence was absolute, perfect, a padded soundlessness, like none ever known or perceived anywhere else in the world
he had not even smiled when she first entered the room; and that immobility, that immutability in his expression said everything
this but in passing
she gave him a reddish one, about half the normal length, in a silver holder, but at the same time she warned hans castorp in a pleasantly husky voice that he definitely had to give it back to her after class, and looked at him with her narrow, bluish-gray-green eyes set above broad cheekbones, and he tore himself out of his dream—because he had it now and wanted to hold on to it: the person and situation that she had so vividly reminded him of
that is to say: adrian gave him two simultaneous parts to read, each of which could be either the upper or the lower voice and so were interchangeable
and the sooner the better…
there is now some cleyer and sweet dandling with the little tune for a while; it is taken apart, each of its segments observed and transformed, and one charming figure in the middle voices is lifted to most magical heights, to the spheres of the violins and flutes, is cradled there for a while yet, until, at its most flattering moment, the gentle brass again announces the chorale from before, steps into the foreground, avoiding the long preparation of its first statement and entering not at the beginning, but as if the melody had already been there for a while, and now moves solemnly toward that
you poisoned life and living
the glass turned angry and frantic
death was a blessing, so great, so deep that we can fathom it only at those moments, like this one now, when we are reprieved from it
that was very kind of you
let things take their course, he concluded and moved wearily toward the glass door, where he stopped
in the repetition of the last verse, however, where the line reads, you could have found rest here, he sang could have the first time in full, yearning chest voice and only the second time in the gentlest of flute tones
what i mean is, he has a point d’honneur, honor is his cup of tea, and that is a matter of feeling, of life
it's the root-canal work i have learned to do, he told me
it certainly does, the lady thinks
joachim, who attached definite importance to such tokens, had of course seen to it that a few flowers adorned the returnee’s place setting; but hans castorp’s tablemates greeted him with little ceremony, with essentially no more interest than usual, as if he had been gone for three hours and not three weeks—not so much out of indifference to this ordinary, sympathetic fellow or out of self-absorption and preoccupation with their own interesting bodies, but because they were oblivious to the intervening time
but good god, he could carry it himself, preferred to carry it himself, and had handed it over to the poor wretch now and then just to be friendly
you should ask behrens to put you temporarily out of commission
how does it happen, then, that rosaline applies to berowne, who in the play is sharp-tongued and downright merry, this bit of wisdom:
-it carried a sigh that removed the thorn of ignominy
there were also other themes: alpine dairy sheds, dewlapped cows standing or lying in sun-drenched pastures, a plucked hen among vegetables with its twisted neck dangling over one side of a table, floral arrangements, local mountain folk, and so on—all of them painted in a kind of brisk, dilettante style, with brash clumps of color that often looked as if they had been squeezed onto the canvas directly from the tube and must have taken a long time to dry
a difference having to do with the heat of one’s blood, one’s sense of chivalry
at last he clasped his hands behind his head and looked out the window at the tumbling, silent snow
russian troops, a million-man army free to force the oder line once it had taken konigsberg and vienna, advanced against the reich's capital city (lying in rubble, abandoned by all government officials), and having completed with heavy artillery a judgment long since executed from the air, they are presently nearing the core of the city
he was a human being and an artist, and he cared not a whit-or a whistle, either, for that matter-about a cavalier's discretion, not when the man he was talking to surely knew as well as every-
yes, i’ve got a headache, and as far as i can see, it won’t be going away all that quickly, because today is going to be something of a drain on me
a waterfall is always an inviting goal for an excursion, and we hardly know how to justify hans castorp’s never having visited the picturesque cascade in the forests of the flüela valley, particularly since he had a special fondness for falling water
herr settembrini said, to repeat myself, my young friends, i am warning you
the tip of his nose froze, of course, and he had to hold his book (it was still ocean steamships) in terribly numbed, chapped hands, but he could gaze out through the arches of the balcony to the valley, which was adorned with scattered lights that clustered brightly here and there and from which almost every evening, for at least an hour, music came drifting his way, pleasantly muted, familiar melodic airs: fragments of operas, selections from carmen, il trovatore, or der freischütz ; well-constructed, smooth waltzes as well as marches to which you could jauntily rock your head back and forth; and cheerful mazurkas, too
the rest of them—ferge, wehsal, herr albin, the prosecutor, herr and frau magnus, the ladies stöhr, levi, and kleefeld—loudly and happily expressed their approval, and even dr krokowski himself nodded with satisfaction, although his relations with joachim had always been cool, since the latter had proved less than obliging in the matter of analysis
i sit here like a pious wretch in his tub, a wood fire crackling merrily beneath him, while a fine conscientious lad fans the flame with a hand-bellows; and before the eyes of his imperial majesty, who has come for a first-hand look (it is nero, you should know, a splendid sultan with italian brocade on his back), the hangman's assistant, dressed in a flowing cloak and codpiece, dips a long-handled ladle into the simmering oil in which i am devoutly sitting and pours some down the back of my neck
genuinely pleased to see him after what had been a rather long separation, they stopped and shook his hand, asked how he was doing and glanced at his companion, expecting to be introduced
and he carefully and elegantly grasped the neck of his bottle of white wine—a small silver stag decorated the cork—and laid it slightly on its side for a closer examination of the label
i bear my song of love
fate did not permit the necessary installations to be completed in time for these flying missiles to disrupt and forestall the invasion
’tis to you it’s dedicated,
very good, very good
what had chiefly impressed him, as he revealed on the way home and the following day in the schoolyard, was the distinction kretzschmar had made between cultic and cultural epochs and his observation that the secularization of art, its separation from worship, was of only a superficial and episodic nature
oh, the young man would eat again soon enough
she made her move, and, in order to hide just how afraid of him she was, she turned loud and angry
ambition and vanity burrow in silence
the second spontaneous generation, the birth of the organic from the inorganic, was only the sad progression of corporeality into consciousness, just as disease in an organism was the intoxicating enhancement and crude accentuation of its own corporeality
well, good lord, it’s the tenth of september
'the rest'-presumably everything possible, both in love and in art
you’ve been busy almost exclusively with aquavit, i see
and for the rest, he proved his independence to himself and others by fundamentally refusing to be accommodating-which meant that when you needed him, he was definitely not to be had
well, that will certainly make for festive times on meng strasse—even more festive than any of you might expect, because you have no idea what special reasons i have for being so delightfully surprised by news of mademoiselle clara’s engagement and for looking forward to what will be a very happy gathering
each summer—in june, or maybe even in may—tony buddenbrook would join her maternal grandparents in their house beyond the burg gate, and for her that was pure joy
an immense number of elegantly printed death announcements needed to be mailed right away
the trip home was rather quiet, if only out of consideration for the old aunt, who had dozed off
this was, of course, no way to fall asleep, and hans castorp now felt no inclination to do so, either
that was what made it both eerie and interesting at the same time
thy lips are too pure and austere for these things
and now you must see to it all alone that we buddenbrooks hold our ground
o dio, three weeks!
and then there he sat cheerfully finishing his meal and pretending as if he had never carried on like a crazy drunkard gone berserk—presumably did not even recall what had happened
since the death of my beloved parents, we’ve kept all three girls working for us in the house, quite apart from mamselle jungmann, and it seems to me …
i can hardly expect you to understand what it means to be obsessed with independence
and scientific accuracy likewise prohibited even thinking of engaging in any such arbitrary departure and return
the conversation stirred hans castorp’s blood—his brow was flushed, his eyes had an eager glint; he had so much to say that he did not know how he should begin to reply
and he comes to a decision
get ready to leave, my child, he said when tony appeared
his little red hands rowed in the air, the down on his skull fluttered; and, framed by his white, close-cropped beard, his whole face, twisted and deformed by this excess of mirth, turned vermilion
he tried a little marmalade, too
the reversal of the general pervasion could be left to itself, in order that the upward progression might continue at its pretty
let’s just watch the others
he stands there in the gentle breeze as she brushes past him, wild with the happiness of having encountered her and of knowing that the word her mouth has spoken, that little merci, was intended personally and solely for him
this was indeed the case
you’ve said that once already, tony, and it only shows just what a helpless child you are
but frau permaneder was not listening
he descended the servants’ stairs to the ground floor, crossed the entrance hall and the cold vestibule, and stepped out into the garden; he went back to the entrance hall with its stuffed bear and stood fidgeting on the main staircase landing with its basin of goldfish—but he could find no rest anywhere, just stood there listening, lurking in the shadows, full of shame and sadness, crushed and driven by his fear of both the secret and the public scandal
each read the other’s eyes—the grand old man and the insignificant young man, the former still with a grasp on the latter’s wrist
joachim got up from the bench somewhat flustered and introduced him, castorp, my cousin—herr settembrini
we were passing the university, and the conductor in his felt boots was standing right in front of me to take my ten pfennigs and had thrust a ticket into my hand, when something incredible and at first, like anything totally unexpected, quite incomprehensible happened
then with several jovial phrases of encouragement, he admitted his guests through one of the doors on the right
things were not in full gear yet at this time of day, she said
and when asked his opinion, settembrini recommended a lexicographic work currently in preparation, entitled sociology of suffering; but the only person to second this suggestion was a bookdealer who had recently joined fräulein kleefeld’s table
but, my god, she must have had a lot of strength left to fight back like that
adrian was far too fond of the accustomed sphere of existence he had so explicitly chosen, too fond of house and farm, steeple, pond, and hill, of his oldfashioned study, his velvet chair, ever to have consented to the idea of exchanging it all for even four weeks of the horrors of spa life, with its table d'hote, promenade, and band concerts
/: and out of the fire back into the ice
ida jungmann let her darning fall to her lap
no one should expect, by the way, that the city he had chosen for his residence actually took him into its atmosphere, ever made him one of its own
i used to think constantly of what it must be like to be backstage
what the—ah, so holger had been a poet, was that it?
joachim stared down at his plate
and in that moment of quiet bliss, hanno buddenbrook took another deep breath of the spicy air sent by the sea, and he greeted the sea tenderly with his eyes—a silent, grateful greeting full of love
but that did not detract from the effect
he drank another glass of liqueur, which restored his spirits a little; he tried telling another story, but then, looking rather depressed, he got up to leave
but tony and morten spent their afternoons in the remote spot where the yellow clay cliffs began and the waves flung their spray high against seagull rock
it read fifty-two degrees fahrenheit
the deep sea's grotesquely alien life-forms, which did not seem to belong to our planet, provided one connection
the neighborhood spoke in its favor: all solid middle-class houses with gables, the most modest of which was directly across the street, a little place with a flower shop on the ground floor
and they finished their meal in silent rancor
his skin was stretched tight across his skull, his large, fleshless nose with its distinct hump protruded sharply between his cheekbones, and his hair had thinned quite noticeably
a lady dabbed her eye with an embroidered fancy handkerchief
he sat back down, then stood up again, muttered a request to use the blanket from joachim’s bed, spread it over his legs, and went back to sitting—flushed, chilled, and tormenting himself with the disgusting taste of his cigar
but you’re right—what can one say?
community lectures) shouted comments and characterizations
vous m 'avez assiste trop peu, mais je ne vous en veux pas
one group of guests had already moved on to the social rooms, while another stayed where they were in order to apply themselves to more burgundy and champagne
suddenly thomas buddenbrook tossed his pince-nez on the table, sending it sliding some distance across his newspaper, and turned now with a jerk to face his sister head on
it was his delicate, humanist smile, the one with which he had first greeted the newcomer on the bench beside the water trough—and just as on that day, hans castorp now felt ashamed of himself
and then we’ll see if i’m not a new man when i get back
yes, he managed to say, his wide eyes fixed on the doctor
i beg you, please—not at all
if we are to get on with our story, however, it will be impossible to fathom and analyze all of that
the three berghof residents turned homeward, and the two pedagogic rivals were forced to enter their little house, the one climbing to his silken cell, the other to his humanist’s garret with its lectern and water carafe
he realized that their climb was coming to an end, that they had taken the crest
if weinschenk has done something wrong, it is most probably nothing more dreadful than what many of his colleagues have done—and got away with
the onlookers watched the eyelids of each contestant, making sure there was no peeking, which several were tempted to try in their helplessness; they giggled and snorted while each candidate blundered blindly at the task, then crowed with laughter when he finally opened his eyes and gazed down at his absurd botched job
but he had given them thought-!
'whoso slaughtereth praise,  it now says, 'glorifieth me
one would have to proceed from here and build longer words from the twelve
moritz still had his shallow chest and yellow complexion, and his pointed gap-teeth showed whenever he spoke in his lively way
it came to the point where people literally gathered to watch the infatuated young man—on the terrace after dinner or on sunday afternoon when all the guests thronged the concierge’s desk to pick up their mail, which on that one day was not delivered to their rooms
as you can see: my eyes are watery, my chest is congested, i coughed half the night away—that’s quite unpleasant enough
well, tom, the consul said, taking his cigar from his mouth, it looks as if that sale of rye to van henkdom & co that i told you about is going to go through
that may be as may be
he felt secure in paradise and simply replied, i had a headache yesterday and couldn’t memorize
so b grünlich had known how to create the illusion that johann buddenbrook stood behind him, had he?
adrian spoke of the prickling sensation that came with realizing one was exposing to sight what had never been seen, was not to be seen, had never expected to be seen
tony asked julie hagenström
meister, do you know,-indeed, i think he said: does the meister know-madame de tolna?

antiquity was not always classic

a young lady, ammy nölting was her name, had first been admitted in the fall two years previous and then discharged as fully cured in august, nine months later—but was back before september was even out, claiming that she did not feel well at home
elisabeth had brought along a collapsible silver cup, and they dipped it in a small stone basin just below the source, refreshing themselves with cool water that tasted of iron
i see, i see, i see
they’re not about to do it

they shall devour their tongues at so great a pain, yet form no fellowship against it, but rather are full of scorn and mockery for one another, and midst trills and groans call out filthiest curses each to each, whereby those most refined and proud, who never let a foul word pass their lips, are forced to employ the filthiest
he gave an interrogatory lift to these last words, as if to say, can what these ears have heard really be possible?
at last the professor sighed and said, oh, buddenbrook, si tacuisses
you’d be doing him a great injustice

hans castorp should, however, concentrate on keeping the medium’s extremities under flawless control
by all means—fine, lovely
what am i laughing about?
patches and streaks of blue sky were visible here and there, and when a ray of sun broke through, the village in the valley below glistened white against the dark forests of pine on the slopes

i’ll go swimming later, tony thought, but first a good breakfast, so that my metabolism doesn’t make me waste away
what was he talking about?
it was the fanatical cult of nothing, of a fragment of melody, a brief bar and a half of childish, harmonic invention—and there was something brutal and doltish about it, and something ascetic and religious at the same time, something like faith and self-renunciation; but there was also something insatiable and depraved beyond measure in the way it was savored and exploited
it seemed that life meant well by its highly confused problem child
he did not have time for this
naphta, too, had sworn an oath to a flag; he, too, had been received beneath a banner, as he himself put it when explaining the nature of his order to hans castorp

i do not choose to speculate to what damnable influences i owe the treatment i have thus far received and borne so patiently; but i do protest said treatment with all the sense of justice i can muster as a christian and a man of business, and i assure you for the last time that, should you not choose to respect my just claims, i will no longer be able to respect you either as a christian or as my father or as a man of business
he answered without realizing it
the veins at consul tienappel’s temples, just below his thinning blond hair, were swollen
they all heard the distant sound now that the carriages had stopped: a soft hiss, that at times slipped below the threshold of hearing, a trembling surge, to which each called the other’s attention as they stood there rooted in place
it may very well be that it does you good and you’ll make the grade
it looked handsome and manly on him, they all said
she assumes an air that displays cold surprise at his presence here, at his very presence in the world, refuses to offer him a hand, a glance, a word-and hurries on her way

voltaire himself affirmed wars that spread civilization, even advised frederick the second to go to war against the turks
morten asked in his ponderous voice
we needed to talk about the adaptation of love 's labour's lost, which i had taken on and which had already occasioned much discussion and correspondence between us
dear father, he continued, you know, i’m sure, the deep respect in which i hold time-honored traditions and principles
the most frequent phrase to pass his lips were the two words, one ought
you spoke of hubris,  used that very word
you can’t possibly know what it is
it really doesn’t matter to us—to us up here, the contorted joachim said, and now it was he, and not the horseman, who was coughing in that ghastly, slimy way
i don’t understand you, thomas, not in the least
surely that charge has more to do with a decided trace of what feels like the icy touch of mass modernity in a work of religious vision, a work that perceives the theological element almost exclusively in terms of judgment and terror-a trace of something streamlined, to risk an insulting term
no—no, agreed, extraordinary, that is, it just goes to show— they took their revenge by exchanging glances—their eyes would meet and then turn heavenward in despair—and even attempted to draw hans castorp into the game; he, however, refused
that’s what mother thinks, that’s what tom thinks

you speak so lightly of it—it was of no importance to you, you married me for love
then he stood there, too, and wept, let the tears flow down his cheeks, like those that had stung the cheeks of the english naval officer—the colorless liquid that flows at every hour everywhere in the world, so richly and bitterly that earth’s vale has poetically been named after it: an alkaline, salty liquid that our body secretes from glands when our nerves are subjected to the shock of pain, whether physical or psychological
the senator felt himself go weak in her embrace

but frau iltis was sitting beside the road, a roguish pucker on her face, and she was holding something in her hand that was supposed to be her stirletto, but was really nothing more than a safety razor

the will to take expression to its very extremes was always a dominant element in his music, alongside the intellectual passion for austere order, for the linear style of the netherlands
he worked hard, and success was his
his glazed, half-open eyes were rolled back, and his lips moved in a silent babble under his mustache
he was bent over the table, rapping it steadily with the tip of his crooked index finger, and stared up with red-rimmed eyes and a bristling mustache at his brother, thomas—who sat pale and erect, gazing down at him with half-lowered eyelids
that is base nature’s way—but a very human, loving mercy swelled up in hans castorp’s breast when he saw that dark, instinctive shame in poor joachim’s eyes

the schweigestills had settled here three generations before
but an idea had been born back then, which had continued to triumph down to the present, and that idea was the dignity of every individual soul, and the equality of all—in a word, individualistic democracy—and in honor of it, he would now empty the glass someone had passed to him

the visitors were sincere in their praise of the abbot's study
it has little or nothing to do with training someone on an instrument, but, rather, with his understanding music
you have dragged beauty through the dust, you have behaved like a vandal, a barbarian—you, a creature whom the muses have deserted, buddenbrook, it’s written on your face
dr mantelsack, however, went on with the lesson
i am certain that as far as schwerdtfeger himself knew, he had gone to marie godeau with the best, the most correct intentions
might i request of you, consul buddenbrook …
how now, genuine and false!
i would gladly accompany you into the mountains, moving alongside you with wings on my heels, like mercury himself—but i dare not
why was i more than surprised, indeed moved and not a little shocked ?
course-how could it have?

the very blond, gaunt young woman took her seat and spooned down her yogurt again, as if this were the only thing she ever ate
the ashes as the immortal part of man

naphta was smoking a cigarette, and hans castorp asked himself whether he would like to do the same and, finding that he had not the least desire, decided this had to be an affectation on naphta’s part
advance, sir, and shoot, he called across to his opponent and began to advance himself as well, his pistol held out chest-high at arm’s length and directed at settembrini—an incredible sight
he has donned a black coat—one of the consul’s old ones—but still has on his greasy high-top boots and has wound a blue woolen scarf around his neck
and that, or at least the possibility of it, would have to be shared with his family
but he was too perceptive and honest not to admit the truth—he was a mixture of both
he said with a despondent shake of his head
his hand trembled as he did it; he was definitely nervous
fumigated, that’s spiffing, he said glibly and somewhat incongruously while he washed and dried his hands
viewpoint includes a recognition of a certain natural won�er-working power of the mind and its ability to regulate and alter the organic and corporeal-and this, if you will, magic side of the matter was what schleppfuss deliberately emphasized, of course, in his commentary on the klopfgeissel case
are we buddenbrooks the kind of people who want to be tip-top’ on the outside, as they say here, while choking down our humiliation within our four walls?

oh, my dear, you’re talking utter nonsense!
i think being up here with us is getting to you
it’s nothing, ida said, just pavor nocturnus
you do find it a good likeness, i hope?
hans castorp was deeply moved
our name means something even without the senator
his uncle asked, having decided to let whicknco pass as some kind of baby talk
she whistled at him, but not with her mouth; her lips weren’t puckered at all, were tightly closed in fact
his cheeks flushed, he would take a deep breath-and then there was a long wait until the next breath
the connection, however,  between adrian's first journey to switzerland and his earlier one to sylt was as follows
the day after old madame buddenbrook had wrestled with death, the senator had been sitting at the table with his wife, and he had made some harsh comments—quite deliberately in the presence of his son, it seemed—about the way uncle christian had behaved, slinking away to bed just when his mother’s suffering had been at its worst

miss robinson once again drank her bloody-red rosehip tea, and the grandniece was back to spooning yogurt
only in his last week, at the end of november, after the weakness in his heart had become noticeable, were there times when his mind would wander and he would suddenly grow confused about his condition and speak hopefully and happily of a speedy return to his regiment and of taking part in the grand maneuvers that he obviously thought were still under way

there sat death, a humanistic rhetorician clad in a blue coat; and when you focused on this philanthropic and pedagogic god of literature, what you saw crouching there had a monkey face, with the symbols of night and sorcery on its brow

nor did it help for the director to remind them that even under such circumstances life at the berghof bore little resemblance to a stay on a prison ship or in a siberian salt mine, or for him to praise the advantages of the local air, so thin and light, which like the pure ether of the spheres lacked all earthly admixtures, good or bad, and protected them from the fumes and vapors of the plains even without the sun; gloom and protest spread, threats of wild departures were the order of the day, and some were even carried out, despite sad examples like frau salomon, recently returned from her willful stay in windy, wet amsterdam, whose case had once been stubborn but not serious, but now looked very much like a life sentence

frau permaneder cried in considerable amazement
they had first taken a street that was faced by an irregular pattern of buildings and ran along the railroad tracks, following the valley’s axis, but then turned left and crossed the narrow tracks and a brook; and they were now trotting up a gently rising road in the direction of wooded slopes and a low, outcropping meadow where an elongated building stood, its façade turned to the southwest, topped by a copper cupola, and arrayed with so many balconies that, from a distance as the first lights of evening were being lit, it looked as pockmarked and porous as a sponge
i really am surprised to learn that i’m a little ill, but i’ll just have to get used to being a patient here, to actually being one of you, instead of merely the visitor i’ve been until now
and then she folded her arms and gazed at the smiling faces like someone sure of her success
i don’t presume you’ve come here to tell me that?

to think that father never lived to see it—it simply makes me want to weep, you know
there is something peculiar about the piece
and i find nothing more tactless and brutal than constantly trying to nail talented youth down to its 'immaturity,  with every other sentence a 'that's nothing for you yet
instead of proceeding to the good russian table, the ill-mannered woman walked soundlessly up to hans castorp and silently extended her hand for him to kiss—not the back, but the palm
she’s getting the director of a brewery
the consul had briefly explained the situation to his own wife, though sparing her the worst details, and in a cold, noncommittal letter he informed herr grünlich that he would meet with him, together with his banker, herr kesselmeyer, at the former’s home—and left for hamburg
it was clear he wanted to hide from them—he would bend down over his plate, turn his head away, even interrupt her in a low, tormented voice, saying over and over, good god, tony!—and his large nose would screw up into a thousand wrinkles
erika was not to be separated from her mother
as if stunned or paralyzed, she lay there on her pillows for one long, ghastly minute; but then, when the scandalous noise did not stop, she picked up her lamp in her trembling hands, left her bed in horrified, grim desperation, put on her slippers, flung open the door, and, still carrying her lamp, hurried to the top of the stairs—the familiar jacob’s ladder that led straight up from the front door to the second floor
castorp, dear castorp, let me whimper a little—you don’t know the nights i have
in your position as the brother of the owner, you will of course have a privileged place among the other employees

while she had been talking, she had picked up the paper and opened it again, letting her eyes glide disparagingly across its columns
and so it will be again, so it will always be
it is not so much the physical and mental exhaustion and abrasion that come with the challenges of life (for these, in fact, simple rest would be the best medicine); the cause is, rather, something psychological, our very sense of time itself—which, if it flows with uninterrupted regularity, threatens to elude us and which is so closely related to and bound up with our sense of life that the one sense cannot be weakened without the second’s experiencing pain and injury
and now this has fallen apart, too
time is money—let us not waste it by hesitating
if so, it’s hardly necessary, he hasn’t given it a thought, i don’t suppose, and when i do remind him, he says, yes, yes, child, your father has other things to do
but, like the other pleasure-loving bons vivants, he understood how to put on the right face, to avoid public offense, and to maintain a reputation for absolute reliability in matters political and professional
as noted, the composer for his hymn, my friend adrian, expatiated on them; but it would be unfair of me to leave the impression that he did so with any sort of deep feeling or emphasis
it was a faith like any other, only worse and more obtuse than all the rest; and the word science itself was the expression of the most stupid sort of realism, which did not blush at taking at face value the dubious reflections that objects left on the human mind and seeing them as the basis for the most dismal and vapid dogma anyone ever foisted on humanity

when we do go out in society—to see kesselmeyer, or consul goudstikker on the alster damm, or senator bock on rathaus strasse—we have to hire a carriage

that’s very true, about sculpture, hans castorp said as they moved away; and forgetting to rehang the painting or even to set it aside, he carried it with him, trailing it behind him into the adjoining area
we’re going to be sensible, aren’t we?
as for christian, mr richardson had written that, although the young man had shown a true talent for making the english language his own, he had not shown sufficient interest in business and evidenced all too great a weakness for the amusements of the metropolis—the theater, for example
after a half-hour in which there was no audible sound except the scratching of pens and the prudent coughs of herr marcus, the consul looked across the green windowsill and spotted christian walking toward the office

when he stood up from one communal meal, hans castorp was already delighting in the next—insofar as delighting was the right word, and not too cheery, simple, light, or common a word for the anticipation bound up with being together again with a lady as ill as frau clavdia chauchat

the concierge had done a good business in paper hats, rattles, and sacks of favors, and prosecutor paravant made a start at keeping the buffoonery going by appearing in a kimono and wearing a false pigtail that belonged, or so someone shouted, to frau wurmbrandt, the general consul’s wife; he had also used a curling iron to turn his moustaches down, making him look every inch chinese

the pedagogue, for example, knew that even today the tendency in elementary education was to move away from the initial learning of letters by sounding them out and to turn instead to the whole-word method, to link writing to the concrete look of things

and you won’t have much success as a patient if you go to behrens with a cold
frau antonie pushed back the sleeves of her blouse with a graceful though impatient gesture, stared up at the ceiling, and cried, grünlich—ha!
simultaneity, he claimed, was in fact the primary factor, for each note, with its closer and more distant overtones, was itself a chord, and the scale was merely sound spread out analytically in horizontal sequence
and accept it as a gift he did-with the look of someone who had indeed said he would not spend money on it
she looked at him
these remarks are inserted here only because young hans castorp had something similar in mind when, after a few days, he said to his cousin (while gazing at him with bloodshot eyes), i’ve always found it odd, still do, how time seems to go slowly in a strange place at first
indeed, although his vanity—which had become almost comical by now—kept him propped up, tumbledown was the only word for him
but when they were finished at last, they put their books away and sat down on the window seat to listen to ida read
with only a conditional, after-the-fact threat still lingering there
before the last course of butter and cheese was served, old madame buddenbrook used the opportunity for another little speech
no matter what she had received, every joy and every sorrow, she had given it back in a flood of banal and childishly self-important words, which she found perfectly adequate for what she needed to express
but he did not look back
for some mysterious reason, he was vain about his pudgy, red hands, which he constantly rubbed together or held clasped in front of him so that he could admire them
i would not think of asserting that, in terms of the courtesy a cavalier owes a lady, he would ever—agreed, dear friend, absolutely unobjectionable
he interrupted in a melancholy voice
no, papa, he concluded with an energetic wave of a hand and stood up taller still, i must advise against your giving in
behrens captured your skin perfectly, oh, truly quite lifelike
for thomas buddenbrook himself, this piece of the world here on the harbor—among the ships, sheds, and warehouses, where things smelled of butter, fish, water, tar, and well-oiled iron—had been a favorite spot since he was a boy, the most interesting place he knew; and since hanno did not express joy and approval on his own, the senator felt compelled to awaken those feelings in his son
the clock of st mary’s struck half past four
actually, he should have left for his private mathematics lesson, but he realized that this was an event before which the men in worsted suits would have to fall silent
as in zurich, he often made her laugh-and marie smile-but in no way hampered a sober discussion that concerned artistic developments in paris and munich and even touched on european politics and german-french relations-a discussion in which, at the very end as he stood to take his leave, adrian joined for a few moments
the late-afternoon sun enhanced the color of the garden’s tidy symmetry of paths and flower beds
if it were merely a trip, a visit to amsterdam—but to leave us forever!
and yet that hardened heart softened at once the first time the literary man spoke to him again—after weeks, as noted—though it was only in passing and in the form of a mythological allusion, which to be understood required an education in the traditions of the west
your sympathies are with the nobility,  he said, and do you want me to tell you why?
with hugo’s consent—indeed, at his express wish—it was decided that frau antonie, at least for the time being, would live with the weinschenks, assisting the inexperienced erika in managing a household—and it was this arrangement that produced in tony the most exquisite feeling, as if there had never been a bendix grünlich or an alois permaneder, as if all the failures, disappointments, and sufferings of life were melting away, and as if she could begin anew with fresh hope
he could not possibly have excluded himself, have lain in bed waiting for the news, first because—but he did not even spell out his first reason, but went immediately to his second, which was that one could not simply let things take their own course
bullinger let the heavy lid down
it’s only natural for a mother to want that
i found no sympathy on his part for these apprehensions, for although he truly loved to debate with me the theological
senator buddenbrook shouted in a thundering voice
the timetable had a word to say as well; our driver was fetched and under a sky now brilliantly strewn with stars, the sleigh brought us back to the little station, where we waited on the platform for the train to munich
before the death of the consul had shrouded the entire family in mourning, she had participated with unapproachable dignity in the social life of her parents’ home and attended parties in the homes of those of equal rank
but i need not tell you, need i, that you will impress them much more by behaving as an equal and energetically doing your duty, than by making use of your prerogatives and taking liberties
this disk, however, was merely like the circular section of an orange that had been sliced through the middle, for it was surrounded in all directions by a multi-stellared, vaporous mantle, which, once again, one could not term immeasurable but
i don’t have the feeling that i’ve quite got used to it all yet and acclimatized myself, although that would be a precondition for any real recuperation
he sang a showpiece aria in his own language—eh, il barbiere
if only the soil can provide a living, then it alone can provide freedom
how now, diseased and healthy!
and, sensing around him the irresistible shadows of sleep and numbness, he swore an oath never to let go of that immense joy, to gather all his energies, and to learn, to read, and to study, until he had made that view of the world—the source of all that he had felt—firmly and inalienably his own
i am alone with my old helene, who tends to my bodily needs, and to whom i sometimes read certain sections, which she in her simplicity can deal with, of what i have written here, toward whose completion all my thoughts are directed amidst the destruction
richard wagner-who, upon hearing the hammerklavier sonata once again in old age and losing himself in it, had burst into raptures for these pure spectra of existence (that had been his locution), exclaiming in his saxon accent: that sort of thing is conceivable only on the piano!
i read somewhere that goethe said something in his bedroom one night to his valet—
her digestion had certainly been in a bad state of late
but he was thrilled not so much because she looked so charming, but because her looking that way only enhanced the sweet fog in his head, increased the intoxication that desired itself, that wanted only nourishment and self-justification
that is how it’s done under such circumstances
what is going on here, huh?
and yet he was really the servant of many masters-and was something of a sponge
i feel as if something is slipping away, as if i no longer hold it as firmly in my grasp as before
he had crossed his hands over his breast and scant beard, his head tilted to one side
on sunday, like a good many other gentlemen who were kept in town on business during the week, the senator joined his family and stayed until monday morning
it was not so much that the parasite deprived the surrounding tissue of its nourishment, but rather, in exchanging materials with its host cell, it formed organic compounds that proved amazingly toxic, indeed ultimately destructive, to the cells of the host organism
it's beauty is not intellectual, but exemplarily sensual
then by way of reply, he said, yes, the latest is that i have a little temperature
i have no great love of formalities
already in the course of their forced march, many a man has severed himself, has proved too young and too weak—turned pale and staggered, doggedly forced himself to be a man, only to fall back all the same in the end; he drags himself alongside the marching column for a while longer, as company after company passes by, and then he vanishes, lying down where it was not wise to lie down
it was: hastening while
well, there is no point in waiting around here any longer
and just as he was about to turn his head to look in that direction, he suddenly found that it was simply too much trouble and not worth the effort
it is but a poor, bourgeois, nineteenth-century thing!
and if this butterfly could become invisible to defend itself, you needed only to page ahead in the book to make the acquaintance of those that achieved the same results by being as conspicuously, indeed gaudily, sweepingly visible as possible
they all stood up, pushed back their chairs, and began slowly to move toward the same door through which the doctor had left the dining hall
do you think i’m blind, that i don’t know what kind of life you lead, in the theater and at the circus and in your clubs, you and your trashy women?
only a keenly observant friendship like mine could have felt or suspected such a shift in what these things meant, and god forbid that those perceptions might have detracted from my joy in being near adrian!
he would never have believed that the essence of music could be so totally alien to his family as it increasingly appeared to be
for it was, of course, quite ridiculous to try to tie the concept of revolution exclusively to progress and a victoriously onrushing enlightenment
i’ve always enjoyed looking at one now and then
and i didn’t even know, never even thought that there still actually was such a thing
i would nonetheless have been infinitely grateful-!
it’s almost nine o’clock—well, not quite nine yet, sad to say
on the contrary—you will prejudice our dignity if you don’t do it, because that would turn a mere bagatelle into a true scandal
this was rudolf schwerdtfeger, a talented young violinist, who sat among the first violins of the zapfenstosser orchestra, which played a significant role in the city's musical life, second only to that of the hofkapelle
this music has nothing whatever in common with the spirit of the festival of spring-which, however, in a certain sense did prepare the way for it-that is, with its spirit of humble glorification; and were it not for certain personal hallmarks of the musical signature pointing to the same author, one might scarcely believe the same soul had produced them both
but she did have to admit that it would be impractical to continue to keep up the spacious and noble house, which had proved to be thomas buddenbrook’s most expensive hobby, and that there was some justification in gerda’s desire to have a comfortable little villa with a pleasant yard somewhere beyond the town gates
but what brings you down here?
couldn’t hanno grow up to be like that?
and where will the likes of you find the simpleness, the naive candour of despair that were the presumption for this hope-
an open book, a skull, and in its light constructed frame, the double hollow of frail glass, and inside it, sand extracted from eternity, to tumble here as time in holy, terrifying stealth
are you afraid that a certain matter …?
do you know hoffmann?
because that’s all she knows how to say, and there’s no one here who understands spanish
and i did not deny it to her, thomas
consul johann buddenbrook arrived at the villa at two in the afternoon; dressed in a gray overcoat, he entered the grünlichs’ salon and embraced his daughter with a certain painful fervor
the diminished seventh, an impossibility; certain chromatic passing notes, an impossibility
and yet i felt a gentle prod of disapproval when schildknapp, pointing at this wonderful display, shouted his, view yonder sight!
it was the smile that revealed his strong resemblance to his mother, but there was a strain to it that i knew well, for it was the best he could manage under the pressure of a migraine
to be sure, the beard made a great difference, and i said that, too, to those who could not get over the fact that it was he
but it was rumored that he was already living off the capital
but hanno showed no signs of waking, although his eyes were staring wide and his lips went on moving
everything went just as before; hans castorp asked to be relieved of his post as primary monitor, but was refused this request by their leader
and so before second breakfast, they went down to the management office to take care of the bill
he had recently finished a piece, a fairy tale, a mad, fantastic tale of adventure, in which everything was bathed in an eerie light; it was set deep within the earth’s most sacred workshops, where ores and mysterious embers glowed, but at the same time within the human soul, so that in some strange way the primal forces of nature and of man’s soul were blended, altered, transformed, and refined—and all of it in a fervent, suggestive, and slightly extravagant language filled with delicate, passionate yearning
farm tell it, there was no denying a certain murkiness or fantastic ambiguity about this entire curious segment of life
and with that he left
the christian middle ages clearly saw that the secular state was inherently capitalist
hans castorp would be able to verify that for himself on the x-ray plate, a copy of which he would soon be given as promised
still unspoken, it plays a role in the jest about the great city of ninevah and the quotation with the prophet's skeptical exoneration of it
i suppose that on the whole it’s the same with love
frau magnus—the woman who was losing protein—supported her unconditionally
you can tell them all by heart and take your pick thereof-!
it was translated almost word for word from the french, with even the original syntax perfectly preserved, lending a certain demeanor and titillating elegance to its exposition of a philosophy of physical love and debauchery, all in a spirit of worldly, life-affirming paganism
fräulein levi screeched that someone had pulled her hair
but one thing was certain—siegismund gosch was a learned and remarkable man
it had all been sung falsetto, the singers barely opening their mouths or moving their lips-a most marvelous acoustic effect
what absurd ignominy to be one of them!
i know death, i’m one of his old employees
my ideas tumble topsy-turvy and go astray because of the excitement that comes with recalling the period i am describing, the period after the collapse of the german authoritarian state, which brought with it that radical loosening of discourse that also dragged my thoughts into its vortex and stormed my staid worldview with new ideas it did not find easy to digest
no, i’m simply going to have to toss it away, he said after trying once more
it’s not possible, he said
no doubt of it
she drank and drank something wonderful, madame antoinette remarked
and they never spoke another word—but just that one time, it really did happen, thanks to hans castorp’s enterprising spirit
i’m not going to let him be proved right about influences
in short, it had been produced with a sympathetic understanding of its international audience and catered to that civilization’s secret wishes
the coachman tipped his hat and madame buddenbrook gave a nod of excessive kindness and said, good morning, my good man, with the sort of patronizing benevolence that thomas found embarrassing on occasion
for military drill, maybe, i can’t say as to that, but none for being ill he constantly wants to leave, can you believe it?
it’s all so wonderful!—my child, he continued now in an earnest, almost stern voice, that exceeds my every expectation
a titillating little mystery, but not all that worthy; by light of day, the epicanthic fold turns out to be an atavistic abnormality
a group of sailors passed by arm in arm, singing and smoking, on their way back from some dubious harbor tavern and looking for one even more dubious for further celebration
no, that was a benighted voice, in herr settembrini’s opinion—which he delivered with much emotion
a love of quarrels
i have not asked you what you might do in such-and-such a case, but, rather, what you will do, here and now
but should i grant the support of my soul to sarmatian despotism, when it is about to put the torch to our most noble continent?
he had always been susceptible to bronchitis and fevers, and then one day he actually coughed up red, and joachim was shipped off posthaste to davos—much to his great regret and dismay, because he was very close to seeing his ambition fulfilled
as little as the term i have in mind seems applicable to a farce, i will use it: it is a religious atmosphere
when, for example, he’s a part-time physician, physiologist, and anatomist with some intimate knowledge of life’s undergarments
that little bit of hail … that little bit of hail, he kept repeating pointlessly
once earthly forms have dissolved, the reestablishment of the city of god will take place where earth and heaven, the natural and the supernatural, meet—salvation is transcendent
all of which gave freemasonry a new fascination and luster, which explains the increased popularity it enjoyed at the time
no, i already knew it on my own
we have to wait for our pupils to get nice and big, like a cat’s, in order for us to see what we want to see
he was a pale, bald man; from beneath an oversize, drooping nose, a black moustache hung down morosely on both sides of his mouth
he said nothing, spoke openly to no one—and to whom could he speak?
the gigantic wall, almost ten thousand feet high, was wrapped in clouds
he would go down to the office at about the same time as thomas and take his seat beside herr marcus and catercorner from his brother—in the same kind of adjustable armchair the two partners used
no, father, i could not bear it
he loved his snuff; he had a longish tortoiseshell box inlaid with gold, and snuff was also the reason he carried red handkerchiefs, the tip of one usually visible dangling from the back pocket of his frock coat
the consul could not comprehend that
the schoolyard—paved with red bricks and cut off from the street by a high shingled wall with two entrance gates—was filled with pupils, some walking back and forth in little rows, some standing in groups, some leaning or half sitting against the tiled abutments of the school building
this often alarmed me-not on account of his future career, which given his aptitude was never in peril, but because i asked myself what, then, was not immaterial, not secondary to him
well, now i have to attend to my moribundus, he said, in room twenty-seven here
that’s exactly what i want, tom
that more or less describes, in round figures, apart from all sorts of minor fluctuations, the state of our finances
it was another shock to his faith in his own good fortune, his authority, his future
nevertheless, there were a few things that could sap his courage for hours on end, dulling the sharpness of his mind and casting him into gloom
who would have thought that evening when i first had the pleasure of greeting you, and you responded to my mistaken view—it was a mistake at the time—by declaring that you were perfectly healthy
signora peronella and her brothers disregarded, did not even hear what to them was everyday behavior, and if a guest seemed taken aback, they merely gave him a smile of apology-but of touching tenderness, too, indeed almost of happiness, as if it were all rather charming
pastor tiburtius and his wife have not let the long trip from riga discourage them from being present at the ceremony: sievert tiburtius, who has laid the two strands of his long, scraggly beard over both shoulders and whose little gray eyes now and then unexpectedly grow larger and larger, sticking out until they almost pop; and clara, who stares straight ahead, with dark, solemn, severe eyes, occasionally putting her hand to her brow, because there is pain in there
where have they all gone?
i would have broken every window in the house
even director behrens took up the phrase, although his very first move was to saddle joachim with four weeks of bed rest: it was necessary just to repair the worst damage, to reacclimatize him, and to stabilize his body temperature for now
beneath it, somewhat more blurred, was an engraved vignette-like emblem, which one could make out (though best under a magnifying glass) as a winged, serpentlike monster whose darting tongue was in the shape of an arrow
above all, the faust cantata differs from the apocalypse in its large orchestral interludes, which at times merely hint generally at the relation of the work to its subject by uttering a so be it!
my, my, tony—fever, you say?
i have spoken of those two needy female souls who by selfless adoration have gained modest mention in the biography of a man who will surely prove immortal
do your best, dieckmann, the consul added
he arrived in his carriage and climbed the stairs supported by his cane and thomas buddenbrook’s arm
but there will be good times now, don’t you think, senator buddenbrook?
it was probably produced according to his own specifications
contrary to all expectation-and to my silent, touched,
they’re dreadfully afraid of an economic boom in kiel
settembrini, meanwhile, had become the advocate of nature and its nobility of health, ignoring any previous notions of emancipation
ominous sounds rose from the orchestra, a gloomy, threatening theme, which as hans castorp knew, moved through the whole opera until the catastrophic end, but here also served as the introduction to the little soldier’s aria—the next record
the clock hand jerked
and then i have a little stand on my chest of drawers where i put it at night and—
wait, stay here!—the consul strode rapidly across the room
he was much too much a man of the semper idem and of self-assertion against circumstance to view as desirable a change in life's scenery that would be simultaneous with the completion of a project pursued in the previous setting
then, with a laugh, he shook the senator’s hand and said, we can leave him to attend to his business
well, the boss would come into the office, and there we were, all eight of us, lying around like flies and smoking cigarettes to keep the mosquitoes away at least
but perhaps it is not yet too late for you to hear
he won’t take any chances
one could use other terms for his kindheartedness—an insipid phrase like purity of soul, for instance, or a more serious and beautiful word like modesty, or disparaging words such as avoidance of the truth and hypocrisy, or even a phrase about the mystic piety of shyness—and hans castorp’s reaction to the sounds from the adjoining room combined something of them all and was visible now as a shadow of respectability that darkened his face, as if he should not know and did not want to know anything about what he heard there
it was a very inadequate insight, based on vulgar intuition and lacking real moral profundity, and so perfectly worthy of frau stöhr—which was why hans castorp replied only with a tired, disdainful glance when she expressed it in her coarse, bantering way
did you hear, mama?
herr tietge’s constant severe coughing spells meant that the floor around his lectern was covered with the mucus he coughed up
i could not even compare the change now taking place with the period when i was already a university student and he was still in high school
that nobility, however, is contained within the mind, within reason, and therefore you will level the charge of christian obscurantism against me quite in vain
it was an outburst of temper
there was music here, too
does a woman feel she owes boundless subservience to a man who would confer the favor of his love on such a lowly creature, or does she see in the man’s love for her an unerring token of his superiority?
down in town, street level had shifted oddly until shops had become cellars you entered by descending stairways of snow
when the director came to a halt in front of hans castorp, he was wearing glasses with thick, circular lenses and was babbling nonsense
frau grünlich now rang the bell; and thinka, the housemaid, entered from the hallway and was told to lift the child from her tower and take her to the nursery
the hall was decorated with flowers, and an altar had been set up on the right side
and we were children-but i am moved to look back not out of nostalgia, but for his sake and at the thought of his fate, which ordained that he ascend from that valley of innocence to inhospitable, indeed terrifying heights
it was quite a different matter whether he would ever be able to bury his chin in such a necktie, tied so that it filled the wide opening created by his grandfather’s peculiarly shaped collar, whose pointed tips brushed the old man’s cheeks
the grotesque part was the vast machinery of scientific witnesses brought in to prove the humbug to be a humbug, a scandalous insult to truth-yet from that angle there was in fact no arguing with a dynamically and historically productive fiction, with a so-called fraud, with, that is, a community-building belief; and the look on its advocates' faces grew all the more sardonically arrogant the more diligently one attempted to refute them on a basis that for them was totally alien and irrelevant, on the basis of science, of respectable, objective truth
approval for that, however, could no longer be obtained that night
goes right to the bone
a little bracing coming from a warm bed
there are people with whom it is not easy to live, but whom it is impossible to leave
sister alfreda had already packed her bag and departed from the berghof, having received an urgent call to report to another moribund patient at a different sanatorium
what did you think it was?
well, my lad, he said, patting him a few times on the back of his head as he sat down beside him at the dining table, across from his wife, how are things going?
herr grünlich had finished his breakfast, and the odor of two cigars blended with the warm air from the stove
the conversation was a true sacrifice on my part
at last, something different, you see, something out of the ordinary, powerful—a savage storm, a tempest
but in his present irritable mood, it seemed to him as if that hostile force was making him a stranger in his own house
what suspense, what subterranean activity
suits us just fine that you’re willing to put up with us for a time
there was the red façade with its bay and the white caryatides; and as they walked out of the noon warmth of the street into the cool of the paved entrance, the senator came out to greet them from his office, his pen still in his hand
i don’t know what you’re talking about, and i don’t want to know
under normal circumstances, the population, the streets, even the warehouses were matters of complete indifference to him, but the moment they were raised to the status of questions on a test, they filled him with reluctant despair
good god, i’m speaking in banalities, but when one is young, everything is, of course, new—new and astounding
what profession had he chosen?
shut up and try to make some progress here, he said
and there’s the last child, little gisela…
later, after ten years of exile, he was able to return to his native land and work as a lawyer in milan, but that in no way prevented him from continuing to call—with voice and pen, in verse and prose—for the freedom and unity of his country, to draft revolutionary programs with passionate autocratic élan and to proclaim in a lucid style that liberated peoples must unite and forge their universal happiness
now and then little drops pricked at the windowpane
they spoke of gerda’s trip, about the train she was planning to take, and about the sale of the villa, along with the furniture, which herr gosch the broker was managing
you will call me when it’s time to eat?
today we can see clearly enough that it was the mistake of our civilization to have been all too generous in exe'rcising such forbearance and respect-since on the opposing side we were indeed dealing with naked insolence and the most determined intolerance
now for-get the pain!
yes, it’s true, sad to say
not without a certain petulance in his voice, joachim remarked that they could probably go take their rest cure now
don’t deserve it at all, inasmuch as you are my patients—both of you now
less path to salvation?
returning to the stairway now, still absorbed in that fleeting glimpse, hans castorp instinctively tried to make the same large, meaningful, and deliberate eyes as those:-of the dying man; and it was with that look that he greeted a lady who had emerged from a door behind him and caught up with him now at the head of the stairs
all the same, after a long, looping flight, the fly came to rest again on grandfather’s fingers, sitting up pertly very close to the ivory cross
even hanno had to help—time was short, and his handwriting was neat and legible
he knocked at the door of a k ferge, who then roused ferdinand wehsal and herr albin from their chairs in the lower lounging area
under the handsome upward sweep of his moustache, the corners of his mouth were drawn into the familiar, delicate, dry, critical smile
i was absent the day this was assigned, he said with a rough edge to his voice
for one brief moment everything was completely still
the responsibility is definitely yours and not mine from the moment you do take over
by the way, conjuring nothing more than a little rain, in the dialect of fulda
but johann buddenbrook was already dead
did you sleep well, consul buddenbrook?
without disease life would never have fared well its whole life long
damnation, hans castorp thought, both bewildered and abashed, that was a regular aria!
a young chinese fellow, however, at the other end of the table, whose knowledge of german was scant, had not understood, but had both heard and seen, and announced his own happy satisfaction by calling out très bien!—and even applauded
god knows how much he understood
the consul would sit down in a large armchair and lay his head back, herr wenzel would begin to lather his soap—and then there almost always ensued a conversation that started with the weather and how each had slept, but soon turned to events in the great, wide world, moved on to the town’s domestic affairs, and generally concluded with very personal matters of business and family
i’m not itching for another excursion
she asked, wringing her hands—but not so that anyone could see
he praised the fact that it had been held in broad daylight, that the old pastor's wedding homily had been short and plain, and that there had been no unseemly speeches at the meal-no speeches at all, just to be on the safe side
grünlich has been very cross the last few days, absolutely insufferable, i must say!
around us is rolling farmland, gouged and battered to sludge
but you don’t blame me, do you?
his indifference was so vast that he hardly ever noticed what was happening around him, in whose company he might be, and the fact that he very rarely addressed by name the person with whom he was speaking leads me to believe that he did not know it, though the addressee had every right to assume so
no, it's only proper
he appeared to be excessively sensitive to the noise of wagons pulling into the farmyard, to the sound of voices
i will not!—and the reaction in the hall was the usual
but there’s gonna be a revolution, sure as rain
does he like school?
one finds oneself among strangers, shows oneself from one’s best side, chooses one’s words, and tries to please—that’s quite normal
he kept climbing along the serpentine path
their signs were now directed to the matter of teatime refreshments
no longer a resident of the international sanatorium berghof, settembrini had been living with lukaček, the ladies’ tailor, for several weeks
and out of this worldwide festival of death, this ugly rutting fever that inflames the rainy evening sky all round—will love someday rise up out of this, too?i used the stimulus that your presence obviously provided to provoke him to speak his last word on certain matters
they always want it to be both/and; they want it all
joachim asked as they climbed the looping road to the berghof
good god, you don’t say?
is that not a generalization?
how’s your cabbage-roll doing, castorp?
because lea gerhardt was deaf, it was customary for her to read aloud on jerusalem evenings—the ladies thought she read most beautifully and touchingly
moreover, concurrent with the uprising and subsequent executions in munich, fever and chills announced an attack of influenza that kept me in bed for ten days and continued to sap the intellectual and physical powers of my sixty-year-old body for some time; and so it is no wonder that since i put the first lines of this account to paper, spring and summer have now become late autumn
no, good lord, he was not a nice-looking customer, the poet said, lifting his brows and shoving a nicely arranged forkful of ham, brussels sprouts, and potatoes into his mouth
herr settembrini did not doubt that the honorable gentleman had means and methods by which to reconcile his office as a teacher of latin with his disdain for the glories of roman civilization
it is his topic, after all
it is easy to see that the book did not bear its menacing title in vain, for it dealt with violence as the triumphant counterpart of truth
what i’ve eaten is clear at the back of my mouth, but these muscles here, along the neck—they just won’t work
you are now at an age, my son, when you are beginning to harvest the fruits of the upbringing your parents have been pleased to give you
yes, wenzel, i cannot imagine the whole enterprise without you
it is rather embarrassing to hear, with the bridal pair right there in front of you
never mind, old fellow, don’t worry
and so he plunged ahead in his long, wooden slippers, gliding down the slope and pushing his way up the next hill, atop which, a little farther off, stood a wooden hut—a hayshed or little barn, with its roof weighted down with stones
will my brother live until tomorrow or not?
it simply interested me very much
the russians, deutschlin said sententiously, have depth, but no form
she heard her brother and sister-in-law enter the breakfast room, heard them stop in the middle of the room, instinctively waiting for her to end her devotions—but she did not let that hurry her
as he said it, frau permaneder laid a hand on his arm and whispered imploringly, thomas, mother is lying in the next room!
it was said that he changed his shirt every day, sometimes twice a day, and that he perfumed his handkerchief and even his mustache, trimmed à la napoleon iii
he added that never had he more regretted not being a physician but a mere numismatist, and at that moment the study of coins truly seemed to me the most futile of sciences, even more useless than philology-an utterly unsustainable position
i have no great desire to throw a ball and have young people leaping around in here—there’s not room enough, anyway
what did the maid scream when she burst in on you?
god was - great in us
this woman or none, he had said, and it must have been more or less the same for gerda, too, because, until she was twenty-seven, she had rebuffed every suitor in amsterdam—and then suddenly had accepted this one
but those are matters from a later period, though they all belong in a chapter dealing with leverkuhn's years in leipzig
and now the matter lay in the hands of the prosecutor, and the prosecutor was dr moritz hagenström
hans castorp was not so dull that he had not noticed that much quite accurately, but he also sensed an inhibiting, restraining effect on his own civilian sentiments—indeed it may have been this proximity, the example he took from it and its supervisory aspect, that kept him from overt actions and blind adventures
tony laid the wreath over the golden letters of her father’s name, which had only recently been added to the stone, and despite the snow she knelt down on the grave to pray softly; her black veil fluttered about her, and her broad skirt lay spread out beside her in soft, picturesque folds
and that was all
my age and the composure that age should, proverbially, bring do not suffice for me to master it with a firmer and steadier hand
the sharp, precise, intense shadows of houses, trees, and telegraph poles cast on the sparkling surface looked more real and significant than the objects themselves
truth and justice are the crown jewels of individual morality; and should a conflict arise with the interests of the state, they may very well appear to be hostile to it, but in fact are directed toward the state’s higher—one may even say, transcendent—good
at that time, may , the first austrian performance of salome was to take place in graz, the capital of styria, with the composer himself conducting-the same opera whose world premiere a few months earlier adrian had traveled with kretzschmar to dresden to see; and he now told his teacher and the friends he had made by then in leipzig that he wanted to participate in the gala occasion and hear once more this successfully revolutionary work-to whose aesthetic sphere he was not in the least drawn, but which of course interested him in its technical musical aspects, particularly the way prose dialogue had been set to music
dr krokowski, who made his rounds at this hour without the director, was speaking in russian with the rude married couple, inquiring, so it seemed, about the husband’s state of health and checking his fever chart
for with that i have dreamed my dream to its end, to its goal
yes, herr kistenmaker was saying the same thing just this morning
in naphta’s organic interior, the illness that had been the physical cause—or, must we say, pretext—for the premature end to his career in the order was making rapid strides, and the elevated and spare conditions under which he lived could not arrest its spread
the fat lady, or in the exceedingly vulgar remarks and horrible obscenities that the devil secretly urged them to blurt out during the sacrifice of the mass and that dr schleppfuss supplied verbatim, with interlaced fingertips
tous les dé vous savez
no one with any common sense could call that a narrative
no, wait, herr settembrini, all i mean is that he has a moist spot, and that prevents him from becoming a priest
it was a miracle of the soul—the ultimate miracle, perhaps, in the eyes of unscrupulous beauty, who gave it her blessing; yet it was regarded with mistrust, and for valid reasons, by the responsible eye of someone playing king, who affirmed life and loved its organic wholeness
only miss robinson, closed off to the world as always, appeared indifferent
six weeks had indeed passed since that evening when hans castorp had made clavdia chauchat’s acquaintance and returned to his room considerably later than conscientious joachim to his; six weeks since the morning after, the day of frau chauchat’s departure—her departure for now, her temporary departure for daghestan, far to the east, beyond the caucasus
he looked pale—even though his whole body was perspiring, his hands and feet were cold
he took his seat and mechanically poured some porter in the tall, heavy glass
it’s all growing splendidly, i can tell you that
i am forty-three years old
and ida jungmann had her self-respect, too
in the corridor they ran into the nurse again, who squinted with nearsighted curiosity as she watched them pass
her hand still in his, he turned toward his parents and lowered his face to the baby girl, who was breathing in rapid, noisy gasps, and for a whole minute he took in the warm, benign, touching fragrance she emitted
look here: the most dynamic, thrilling sequence of variations, of events, of movement, but all within time, consisting solely of time divided, filled up, organized-and only once given a vague push toward the concrete action of the plot by the trumpet's repeated distant signal
hans castorp said nothing, and in doing so only revealed the gloom within
how could i not have been reminded later, then, of this comparison-which at the
but do i dare risk it?
to be sure, there were not only incubi, but succubi as well, and indeed there had been a depraved young man in that classical age who had lived with an idol whose devilish jealousy he would come to know in the end
the large gardens stretching down to the trave, and the house set back from the road, and the driveway bordered with chestnuts
she calls it a stirletto—isn’t that capital!
i have work to do now; and you might spend a few days taking care of the english correspondence
james tienappel, whom hans castorp addressed by turns as uncle james or simply james, was a long-legged gentleman nearing forty, who wore english suits and linens white as cherry blossoms; he had thinning, canary-yellow hair, very close-set blue eyes, a straw-colored moustache trimmed so close that it was almost not there, and perfectly manicured hands
the consul had to admit that
but as far as the senator’s mood goes, if i may say so—the senator’s looking a bit pale again this morning
with stubborn slowness, her energies continued to wane
he told me that he had written you, that you’d be coming
these men cannot be thanked enough, and they are proof that the democracy of the west-however outdated its institutions may prove over time, however obstinately its notion of freedom resists what is new and necessary-is nonetheless essentially on the side of human progress, of the goodwill to perfect society, and is by its very nature capable of renewal, improvement, rejuvenation, of proceeding toward conditions that provide greater justice in life
i’ve had it for now, at any rate
she came to him
but all the same, hans castorp decided to stay here for now, since the overhanging roof provided the illusion of some hospitality, and the side of the hut facing the mountains, which hans castorp now sought out, actually did offer a little protection against the storm, if you leaned back so that one shoulder touched its rough-hewn logs—since long skis made it inconvenient to press your back to it
the room, chilled by winter, lay in total darkness
as if quite by chance, he directed a remark to the young lady, and introducing both himself and joachim to her by name, he pulled over a third enameled chair for her—the better for him to put on his show
rubble of our cities, the thunder of russian cannons rolls on toward berlin, for the anglo-saxons the crossing of the rhine was child's play and was made that, it seems, by the uniting of our own will with tha�
upon returning to his mother’s home, he moved into his old room off the corridor on the second floor, but spent more time at the club than on meng strasse, because life was not made easy for him there
i could have become a clergyman, too
no one understands where all these rumors are coming from, how they get started; but somehow they find their way from behind the doors and spread out into the street
you love order more than liberty, all europe knows that
however matters stood, he was firmer than ever in his resolve not to lift a finger to help
it cost me a pretty penny to puff it a bit, too
i said with a laugh as well
tut, tut, tut, he clicked his tongue
this, then, is how beauty happens: the cellos intone all by themselves a somber, pensive theme that questions the world's folly in a forthright and highly expressive philosophical 'why' addressed to our hustle and bustle, our hounding and harrying
but they were both bareheaded, even hans castorp, and so they merely walked on ahead reverently, in single file behind karen karstedt, who led the way, placing their weight on the balls of their feet and making what looked like a series of little bows to the right and left
and your good father?
well then, help yourself to the wineglass
in it will be found the impulses-indeed their seeds are already found-for shaping not just the technical realization of a new economic organization, not just for a thoroughgoing cleansing of the natural interrelations of life, but also for the founding of new political orders
i find myself in a highly peculiar and extremely ticklish position
happy-always a questionable adjective, by the way-it is because i was drawn much more strongly into the sphere of his studies than he into mine, and because theological air did not suit me, seemed uncanny, made it difficult for me to breathe easily, and presented me with a dilemma of conscience
she would wake up every morning here without a care in the world
it earns its livelihood from various industries (machine tools, leather, textiles, armatures, chemicals, and assorted mills); and the historical museum, which features a chamber with crude instruments of torture, contains a very excellent library of twenty-five thousand volumes and five thousand manuscripts, among them two alliterative magic charms that scholars consider older than those of merseburg-and of quite harmless import
hans castorp continued to hold back
his laugh came a little late now and he said, he called it home, did he?
what good are fine manners if i’m being cheated up one side and down the other?
old hinrich played underhanded tricks on grandfather and father, and if hermann hasn’t been able to do you any serious harm, if he hasn’t been able to put a spoke in your wheels, it’s because you haven’t given him a chance
he had some chocolate in his breeches pocket and had slipped a little bottle of port into his vest
i leave it to you whether one should praise barbarism for it or not
who was the woman in black out in the garden?
i felt that in some way i had always loved him, and i must admit that my compassion for him was far more intense than for the unfortunate woman who, though pitiable in her sunken state, had been brought to this heinous act by suffering and the demoralizing vice that numbs it
he, naphta, asserted this to counter the impudence with which materialistic science passed off as absolute knowledge all its astronomical bunkum and windy palaver about the universe
thank god, people smoke all over the world, there’s nowhere you could possibly end up, as far as i know, where tobacco’s unknown
i mean their placement, their shape
the audience almost died laughing at his parlando falsetto, at the contrast between this bear of a voice and his talent for tongue twisters
he apparently used music paper because nothing else was available at the moment, or because the little shop down below on st agapitus square could supply him with no acceptable stationery
he was sitting at his desk and as i entered looked up with only a fleeting and, as it were, disparaging glance
an example of this was that married woman who, in the trusting, slumbering presence of her husband, had carried on with an incubus, for years
oh, i haven’t slept a wink yet
it was nine or ten days later before it happened again, and there was no need to comment on it
and she was out of the room
a man climbs jauntily up into the wonderful variety of jagged, towering, fissured forms to test his vital energies, because he has never had to spend them
an absurd statement, if you like
the house is going to be as crowded as a chicken coop soon enough
i would like to know with what eyes those epochs would have regarded the man from wittenberg who, as we learned from jonathan, some hundred and more years previously had conceived an experiment for making music visible, which we indeed saw demonstrated on occasion
the cock crowed, the pig grunted, peas flew
for he had been unaware of my approach
i would like to provide a vivid illustration of the jauntiness that so depressed me

it all had to do with the next generation, the propagation of the human species, yes indeed
it is not easy to describe even th� simplest things without resorting to musical notation, which would give this little work an all too scholarly, technical appearance
he stood with both feet in the present and worried little about the family’s past, although at one time he had contributed a few entries to the heavy gilt-edged notebook in his own somewhat ornate hand, most of them, however, concerning his first marriage
o lord, i find it simply sublime
well, consul, sir, corl smolt said, somewhat intimidated now
you may speak frankly
in that case, the consul decided, he would have to make the best of it and hand over whatever sum was necessary
it was true, after all, that for hans castorp the relationship with poor karen was a kind of substitute, a vaguely useful device—but that was true of all his other charitable enterprises as well
for a person like myself, when dealing with a subject as dear to the heart, as searingly urgent as this, it is very difficult, indeed it verges on impudence, to assume the standpoint of the composer and to treat the matter with an artist's playful equanimity
it was merely because we just happened to stumble on the subject
she was even ready to assert that on two or three occasions her friend and sister-in-law, tony, had managed y’all take care now!
forgive me, mynheer peeperkorn, hans castorp replied, but my sentiments toward you, sentiments of the greatest respect and admiration, would make it unseemly for me to say anything to you about my sentiments toward your traveling companion
by retarding or heavily accenting some very simple harmonic maneuver, he gave it a higher, mysterious, precious meaning
a solicitous, bespectacled young man and i lifted poor rudolf out of the car, behind which two or three other streetcars were now backed up
it was pfahl, a farmer from the ritzerau district, deputy for the village of klein schretstaken
i haven’t been able to catch it any time it’s been mentioned … and it’s making me downright nervous

for no plans had been made for bringing people from the station to the farm-and frau schweigestill, whom helene and i looked for in the kitchen and found along with clementina very hastily fixing a snack of coffee, finger sandwiches, and cooled cider for all these people, explained with no little dismay that adrian had not said a word to prepare her for this mvaswn
i keep it at the ready for the day when all this malarkey here gets too boring and i shall have the honor of paying my final regards
what does high society matter to you?
a regular hustle and bustle!
and only now came the shimmering chorus of brass instruments-from the dapper trumpet, whose bright alarms, jaunty tunes, and melting cantabiles can be seen in its very form, via that darling of the romantic period, the convoluted french horn; via the slender, powerful slide trombone and the valve cornet; to the fundamental gravity of the great bass tuba
do you see the diaphragm?
but the two must be compatible, damn it

composure up and down the line
the suggestion had been hans castorp’s, and although joachim had some doubts at first because of poor karen, he had yielded, admitting that it would have been pointless to play hide-and-seek with her, shielding her out of anxiety, à la cowardly frau stöhr, from anything that might remind her of her mortality
grieskramer zeile, a crooked narrow way with no sidewalk, and among its houses nikolaus leverkiihn's was the most imposing
i am kindly disposed to the discretion you show in leaving the german rendering to me

the consul was busy with his cigar and the advertiser
the candles on the tall tree had burned down and gone out, leaving the manger in darkness; but a few candles were still burning on the trees on the table; now and then a sprig would crackle as it was singed by a nearby flame, adding to the fragrance that filled the room

finally he gave up and left it all to god
rather than construe from my informed state that i am not present in the flesh, you would do better to conclude that i am not merely in the flesh, but am also he for whom you have taken me all this time
who knows whether anything worth mentioning will even show up, or whether i won’t have rid myself of my fever by then and can bid you all adieu
and hans castorp’s heart hardened against herr settembrini; he scowled and pursed his lips whenever their paths crossed—and herr settembrini’s flashing black eyes would rest on him in silent reproach
the plot was years in the planning, and one could not deny it a certain sad success-over time, solitude's defenselessness against such wooing became evident, although it proved the ruin of the wooer
how are your admirable constitutions doing?
it is truly remarkable: an esoteric early renown such as had begun to be associated with leverkiihn's name, although totally hidden from the broad masses, has its focus in certain initiated spheres, in a response among leading experts, of which the invitation to paris had been a token; but at the same time that renown may also be reflected in humbler, more modest realms, in the needy emotions of poor souls whose lonely and passionate sensibilities (cloaked as higher aspirations) remove them from the masses and who find happiness in a veneration they cherish all the more for its very rarity
neither can there be any doubt that the young man could not help responding to an emotion pressed upon him out of such torment and intellectual superiority
he might put his finger on a transition that held together only on the surface, but had no organization and jeopardized the natural flow of the composition

you’re asking if i’m feeling better after these few days, is that it?
having arrived in pfeiffering before us, this vehicle was now put to good use traveling back and forth between the little station and the schweigestill farm, transporting small groups of those guests who preferred not to walk-and the weather held, although there was a thunderstorm growling softly on the horizon
i read that question somewhere, i am not sure where, certainly in some prominent place
can it be possible?
the valley’s famous for its wildflowers

he loved to pace about his classroom with long strides and grew astoundingly animated as he laid out for each student the future course of his life, always with the manifest purpose of stimulating his imagination

the master had worked all evening, well into the night, on the credo, the credo with its fugue, never giving a thought to his evening meal, which still stood on the stove, whereupon the serving girls, having waited long in vain, at last yielded to nature and went to bed
hans castorp kept his tobacco away from the deleterious effects of the house’s steam heat by storing it in the cellar, and every morning he would descend to provide his cigar case with its daily ration
i said almost nothing on the stairs
the young people agreed with them both, first the one and then the other

the one for five francs
she was a prosaic soul, this protestant nurse
it goes without saying that the choice of the thirteen songs was totally his own; i had not the slightest influence on it

another one of your jokes
his deep affection for a girl named barbel, the only daughter of a widowed sexton, was returned, and he wanted to marry her; but the couple's wish met with resistance from the father, for klopfgeissel was a poor fellow, and the sexton demanded that he first achieve a worthy position in life, become a master in his trade, before he would give him his daughter

all the rest is elaboration, the grindstone
he was consumed by his own restless energy, which for him had always been something different from his father’s natural and solid joy in work, something artificial, more like a nervous itch, practically a drug—like the pungent little russian cigarettes he constantly smoked

fräulein arnoldsen, tony’s roommate from boarding school, whose father, a notable merchant and an almost even more notable virtuoso on the violin, was likewise present, as were his married daughter and her husband
but that was not the only problem
what do you drink for breakfast, julie?
and i protest yet a third time, against the harrowing alternative you have presented us with: prussianism or gothic reaction
good eyes, he said, good stock, an honest, sound, tidy gentleman
these the remarks of an old man who has seen something of life
one might say that the figure of this kirghiz emerged imperceptibly out of the fog and into his life, slowly taking on clarity and palpability, until the moment when he was most near, most physically present, there in the schoolyard, stood there in the foreground for a while, and then gradually receded and vanished again into the fog, without even the pain of farewell

there was something on her mind, one great, inescapable question that occupied all her anxious thoughts and that would have to be dealt with before many hours had passed
the same prodigious meals were also served at the so-called bad russian table; moving in rotation, even rhadamanthus folded his gigantic hands before his plate there; and the people of several nations who dined at it were honorable members of humanity, even if they did not understand latin and were not excessively dainty about their table manners
the renaissance, the enlightenment, and the teachings of nineteenth-century science and economics have omitted nothing, absolutely nothing, that seemed even vaguely useful for furthering such degradation, beginning with modern astronomy—which turned the focal point of the universe, that sublime arena where god and satan struggled to possess the creature whom they both ardently coveted, into an unimportant little planet, and, for now at least, has put an end to man’s grand position in the cosmos, upon which astrology was likewise based
two other members were even more remarkable—a pair of twins, two quaint old maids dressed in very faded frocks and shepherdess hats from the last century, who wandered about town, hand in hand, doing good deeds
that afternoon adrian and i took a walk around the cattle trough and up mount zion
there are ways—and i shall go to dr gieseke, who is a friend of christian’s, and he will stand by me
what followed was likewise received as a droll introduction of humorous intent, and although the immobility of his face, the weariness of his glance, and his pallor spoke against this, the response that greeted him around the room was first one of laughter-soft snorts through the nose or titters from the ladies
but that was a mishap that revealed itself only later

on certain days of the year—on palm sunday, when there were confirmations, or on new year’s day—senator buddenbrook would take the carriage for a round of obligatory social calls; and since his wife preferred to excuse herself on such occasions with a migraine or a simple case of nerves, he would invite hanno to join him

one could hardly even call it a coiffure

they laughed so hard they almost burst
he saw what i saw and snatched the note away, saying,  good sir and brother, what vain pertness is this!
i thought you wanted to join the military someday, a healthy man

like all of us, you have your good points and your bad
as if dazed, people would say, why, look at that!
every man had to untangle the riddle on his own, had to work diligently at it, at hot speed, all by himself; before it was too late, he must either achieve some clear readiness for death, or die in despair
so much, then, for today about an instrument that was not one, at least not in the sense others were, for it lacked any special quality
amateur photography had always played an important role in the world of the berghof; but twice now—and we have lingered up here long enough to experience periodic reoccurrences of such epidemics—it had become a passion that made fools of everyone for weeks and months

a hand slapped the back of his chair
that is—those are—gentlemen, let me call your attention to—cerebrum, cerebral, you understand
and yet there was something here-and that elfin mockery seemed to express an awareness of it-that made one incapable of believing in time, in its vulgar work and its power over this gracious presence; and that something was that presence's strange selfcontainment, its authority as the very presence of the child on earth, the sense that it instilled of its having come down to us, of its beingto repeat myself-an adorable envoy, a sense that cradled reason in dreams beyond logic and with a tinge of our christian heritage
ism is friendly to science; but that cannot be, for one cannot regard the subjects of science as the devil's work without regarding science in the same light

he’s already shown his liberal tendencies, wilhelm has, and doesn’t share his brother’s secret disgust for the constitution
my heart is beating strong and knows why
she arrived only three days after this humane alert had been sent off, and hans castorp fetched her by sleigh from the station in dorf—stood there in a snow flurry on the platform before the little train arrived and composed his face, so that joachim’s mother would not be too alarmed at first glance, but would not read any false message of good cheer in it, either
i’m independent, have enough to live
his wife interrupted him
even friedrich wilhelm marcus is on hand
then the freemason sank down hard onto his chair and pressed his hands to his heart
and here silence is but natural, yet not twixt us nor over time-not when the hour-glass has been turned, not when the red sand has begun to run through that subtly subtle bottle neck
seven and four, hans castorp said

together, shakespeare and beethoven formed a binary star that outshone all else in his intellectual heavens, and he loved to show his student the remarkable affinities and correspondences in the creative principles and methods of those two giants-only one example of how far the stutterer's pedagogic influence on my friend extended beyond that of a mere piano teacher
look closer now, my lad!
and the entire dining hall had burst into homeric laughter
but it was just such unbounded, nonchalant, peaceable subordination that annoyed thomas, because on any given occasion christian was so blithely docile that it appeared as if he set no value whatever in superiority, competence, seriousness, or respectability

he watched the single cell of the fertilized egg transform itself into a multicelled organism that grew by cleavage and division, saw the cellular ball nestle up against the lamellae of the mucous membrane, saw the blastula fold in on itself to form a basin or cavity, which then assumed the task of receiving and digesting nourishment
and that nose is jewish, too—take a good look at him
she would turn her back on him
it’s really sad, isn’t it?
peeperkorn did not reply
therese weichbrodt had read the christmas story from the bible, so impressively that all her vowels were out of place, and then she stepped back from her guests to stand in the doorway and deliver her little speech

life makes it so dreadfully difficult, you know, to believe in anyone’s innocence
as matters now stood, hans castorp had almost totally renounced such feelings, and instead it was the italian who annoyed him with that conceited talk about parthians and scythians—without even specifying the bad russian table, where those students sat with heads of thick hair and not a trace of collar or cuff, arguing in their alien tongue, apparently unable to express themselves in any other, a boneless language that reminded hans castorp of a thorax without ribs, like the one director behrens had described recently
can anyone understand the hushed thrill with which the news, at first only a whispered hint, was borne from breite to meng strasse?
unfortunately for the sexton's daughter, the old woman alleged that the dragon had given her the task of making numerous proselytes, since for every person she brought to him with enticements to use his gifts, he would make her
in its fraternity jargon and cadence, medical authority had announced the true cause for the waywardness of hans castorp’s body temperature and offered its scientific opinion that the cause would not be difficult to overcome and that a cure and authorized release back to the flatlands suddenly loomed ahead in the near future

they are sitting at the dinner table; the fruit has been served and is being enjoyed amid genial conversation
the fire crackled behind the shiny wrought-iron grate
a pure masterpiece, born out of the profoundest, most sacred depths of a whole nation’s emotions—its most precious possession, the archetype of genuine feeling, the very soul of human kindness?
in our case the sinners were likewise bound together by a definite philosophy or maxim that had originated with inez institoris, and to which all five or six friends subscribed as their justification
without our subcutaneous cell structure we’d all end up looking like some sort of wrinkly fungus
i’ve always loved you
clavdia chauchat—listless, worm-eaten, kirghiz-eyed; and whenever hans castorp thought of her (although thought is an all-too-inhibited word for describing how he turned inwardly toward her), it seemed to him that he was sitting again in that boat on the lake in holstein and gazing with dazzled and bewildered eyes out of glassy daylight across to the eastern sky and the moonlit night draped in a web of mist
i will have to look for it
she carefully turned the handle of the door directly ahead of her and entered
how amusing and kind of you, ha ha, ha ha
he set his sights on adrian at once, wooed him, to the point of practically neglecting the ladies, asked for his opinion, for his company (which adrian always refused in those days), was eager to engage him in musical and extra-musical conversation, and was not to be daunted, disillusioned, or disposed of by coolness, reserve, distance-a sign of an uncommon lack of guile, but also of a happy-golucky sensibility and natural good manners
did thomas buddenbrook stand with both feet firmly planted in that hard, practical life—as had his father before him?
only a few handbreadths separated his face from hers, its features so extraordinary and yet familiar to him for so long now—and that face spoke to him like nothing in the world
and this whole sunny region—these easily scaled coastal heights, these laughing rock-bound pools, and the sea itself, as far as the islands where boats sailed past now and then—was populated in all directions: people, children of the sea and sun, were stirring and resting everywhere, intelligent, cheerful, beautiful, young humanity, so fair to gaze upon
your wanting to study botany—picked that up from krokowski, did you?
something higher and that he would be the first educated man in his family
or nine, right off?
maybe i’ll start on it later, during drawing class
two ds, three ds, one after the other-the chords do that-dimdada!
he seemed in a constant state of embarrassment
all of this meant a constant strain on his will, and it brought him neither success nor a sense of satisfaction—only gnawed away at his self-respect and left him feeling desperate
i did not find it difficult to identify these lines as the opening words of a hymn to apollo by callimachus
you dare not hand your works over to me for performance in absentia!
you could go for a walk, into the village, along front row; and from there you could take a boat across to priwall, where you could find amber on the beach; or you could join in a game of croquet on the playground or sit on a bench under the trees up on the hill just behind the hotel—that was where the large dinner bell was—and have ida jungmann read aloud to you
i am thinking here of a sentimentality, a trancelike self-hypnosis that is not european, that is foreign and hostile to our active hemisphere’s law of life
if it seems long to you, then it is long, and if it seems to pass quickly, then it’s short
even the most manly men succumb to credulous, oblivious self-deception; the phenomenon is as natural as it is melancholy when the process of deterioration approaches its fatal end—natural and impersonal and beyond all individual conscious effort, much as the temptation to wander in circles overcomes someone who is lost or sleep ensnares someone freezing to death
frau permaneder responded to this with violent emotion
one could not even imagine his ever laughing heartily; he managed little more than a dry, delicate tightness at one corner of his mouth

i’m merely an employee

he began to speak of his parents, who had died much too soon, and talked about his father, who was a preacher, a pastor, a man whose christian principles and urbanity were on the same high plane
but how could he!
conformation, mimicry, you know it well, the mumchance and conjuring of mother nature, who always keeps her tongue in her cheek
as for frau stöhr, she danced with her broom, pressing it to her heart and caressing its bristles as if they were the hair on a man’s head
it was a telegram
you will walk on all fours, you are tipping down onto your front limbs already, and will soon begin to grunt—beware!
and so it’s not physical, either
she could picture her future children prattling in french
she was somewhat disappointed when her papa would not hear of hiring a separate maid for them; and she spent a half-hour in pensive reflection the day he gently explained to her that her only proper course of action for now was to live a private life apart from the social whirl of the town, for, although by all ordinary standards she was an innocent victim of the fate that god had sent to test her, her position as a divorced woman demanded the greatest discretion at present

on mysterious empathy, kinship of soul-this could result in her showing up at surprising places
because human progress was always gathering up new nations in the course of its brilliant advance, conquering new continents—indeed all of europe itself—and had even started to press on into asia
whereas in my heart i had to admit that his behavior, the whole arrangement-with rudolf, of all people, as the intercessor and wooer-
according to him, decline, stultification, and the loss of all feeling for what was old and genuine had begun early on and in a place so respectable that no one would ever have dreamt it
one would think that in such an agonizing situation time would have had to have seemed longer to them
frau chauchat complied with the demands of western civilization and introduced the gentlemen to one another

it seemed hardly advisable to leave further opportunities for meeting the lady of his choice to simple luck
they stood there bending toward one another
a grand day dawned for herr siegismund gosch the broker
it is like a word, a key word that leaves its signature everywhere in the song and would like to etermine it entirely
it slid to the edge of the table, moved along it a short distance, and then headed straight back to more or less the middle of the table
for s e c
we shall play and eat and drink
freedom was in fact probably more an idea of romanticism than of the enlightenment, for as a concept it shared with romanticism the same complex, never-to-be-disentangled interlocking of the human instinct to expand and the passionate, constricting thrust of the individual ego
and he hastily searched his memory for vocabulary and syntax
became t h e triumph
no, i think i can set your mind at ease there
the days get longer during winter, and when we get to the longest one, the twenty-first of june, the beginning of summer, they start getting shorter again and it all heads right back downhill toward winter

to be brief—there’s a letter from gotthold, he said quickly in a low voice and, gazing into her dark, questioning eyes, he pulled the folded and sealed paper from his pocket
jonathan leverkiihn was a man of finest german stamp, the kind one scarcely ever sees now in our cities and certainly not one of those who, with what is often overbearing bluster, represent our version of the human race nowadays-a physiognomy somehow marked by the past, preserved out in the country, so to speak, and brought in from a germany predating the thirty years' war

and they resumed their visits to settembrini and naphta, as well as walks with those two antagonistic allies; when they were joined by a k ferge and ferdinand wehsal, which frequently happened, that made a party of four before which the two intellectual adversaries could engage in constant duels—and we could not hope to present them in their entirety without fear of likewise losing ourselves in the same desperate infinitude into which they daily threw themselves for their large audience, although hans castorp chose to see his own poor soul as the chief object of their dialectic rivalry
but dictated no results

how elegant, tony said, tilting her head to inspect it

you’ve given your word!
gerda had finished with her hair and was now brushing her broad, white teeth, holding her small ivory mirror in the other hand
and hans castorp caught a fleeting glance of her broad cheekbones and narrow eyes—and at the sight, a vague memory of something or somebody brushed over him
no, it is bootless to speak of it, for it lies apart from and outside of language, which has nothing to do with it, has no relation to it, and that is also why language never rightly knows which tense to apply to it and makes shift perforce with the future, for as it is said: 'there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth

bicolor flags floated from every building beneath the deep blue summer sky—all the way down fischer grube, from breite strasse to the docks, where the wullenwever and the friederike oeverdieck lay under full flag in honor of their owner
two rows of jeweled buttons sparkled on his black velvet vest
but the word elegant was firmly fixed in tony’s little head, and she was most emphatic about applying it to gerda arnoldsen

this chapter was entitled: concerning death and its relation to the indestructibility of our essential nature
but discussion was a habit now, thanks to his democratic mentors—both were basically democratic, although the one struggled not to be—and he got caught up in one of his own ingenuous commentaries

they noticed that she was busy doing something rather curious, an activity with which the others seemed familiar, but that caught hans castorp’s attention, and he watched in amazement: for several minutes she reached out her cupped hand until it was at about her hip, then pulled it back—stretched it out and with a ladling or raking motion, pulled it back, as if she were collecting or gathering something
he’s sure to notice
yes, yes, adrian said with a laugh and a nod, walked into the house, into the pungent, tobacco-laden air, and went upstairs, where his landlady led him down the whitewashed, musty corridor to the bedroom assigned to him, with its brightly painted wardrobe and its bed piled high with fresh featherbeds

they ordered a bottle of gruaud larose, which hans castorp sent back to be brought to room temperature
hans castorp was trapped between them; turning his head back and forth, he would agree first with one, then with the other, or he would come to a stop, bending his body backward and gesticulating with a hand inside its fur-lined goatskin glove, and offer some opinion of his own—some highly unsatisfactory comment, of course; meanwhile ferge and wehsal circled the three of them, now walking in front, now behind, now forming a single row, until oncoming traffic broke the group up again
he went into the adjoining room, stretched out on the chaise longue, and lay there for a long time without stirring a muscle

helene, nee olhafen, my splendid wife, who even now in my declining years still looks after me, was the daughter of an older classicist colleague in zwickau in the kingdom of saxony, and at the risk of bringing a smile to the reader's face, i will admit that the glowing young lady's first name, helene-such precious syllables,-played a not insignificant role in my choice as well
in reality, however—that is, apart from any theoretical system—in terms of snow and cold, it had been winter now for god knew how long; winter had been interrupted, as always, only very briefly by scorching summer days with a sky whose blue was so inordinately deep that it verged on black—by summer days, then, that could occur in the midst of winter, too, if you ignored the snow, which, by the by, could also fall at any time during summer
all right, kesselmeyer, i’ll write
he loved his pipe, a half-length porcelain affair with a lid and a distinctive tobacco odor that hung in the air of the downstairs rooms and was far more pleasant than stale cigar or cigarette smoke
heaven, earth, and sea melted into one another, while gusts of wind picked up the rain and drove it against the windows until drops became streams that ran down the panes, making it impossible to see out

you are a decent, simple fellow from a good family, with handsome manners, a docile pupil to his teachers, who will soon return to the flatlands in order to forget completely that he ever spoke in a dream here and to help repay his great and powerful fatherland with honest labor on the wharves
because you exude something that he lacks and that i regard as propitious for my wishes and hopes
you’ll find it a little namby-pamby of me to insist on it, i suppose—now that you’ve taken to kicking over the traces
yes, yes, he suddenly said in a slightly mocking tone, a good night’s sleep is a fine thing
there was a basket of keys in front of her
even his vanity, his much-derided vanity, proceeded largely from this same worry
on another occasion he said, for an age of culture, our own age talks a bit too much about culture, do not you think?
but there was not a strand of white to be seen in her smoothly parted, reddish blonde hair
she did not go to pieces at the sight of her fine son
schools based on humanistic education—you may call me backward if you like, sir, but on principle and in abstracto, do understand me correctly, i beg you—i remain their firm supporter
surely not, mynheer peeperkorn
and then there’s the july monarchy and practical ideals
do you know what tom thinks?
i love you, he babbled, i have always loved you, for you are the intimate you’ of my life, my dream, my destiny, my need, my eternal desire
it was so small, in fact, such a tiny, initial, ephemeral concentration of something immaterial—of something not yet matter, but related to matter—of energy, that one could not yet, or perhaps no longer, think of it as matter, but rather as both the medium and boundary between the material and immaterial
oh, please sit here on the edge of my bed for a while, my good old ida
but when the sun enters libra, about three months from now, then the length of the days will have decreased until day and night are equal, and will continue to decrease until around christmas—you know all that
as to the reasons, i can only say that they lie in darkness, lie there together with the origins of my sentiments toward your traveling companion—and i expressly call her that to make clear that it would never occur to me to try to alter a legitimate state of affairs—with the origins of my sentiments toward clavdia chauchat and of my addressing her with only informal pronouns, a relationship that i never denied from the moment her eyes first met mine and fascinated me—fascinated me in the most irrational sense of the word, you understand
i’m driving you to ruin?
it was a gift from my parents at my confirmation
and how is dear jürgen doing?
she asked, turning to hans castorp
and then there’s the republic of the world
did the gentlemen know, by the way, that behrens had been the inventor of the summer season?
sesame weichbrodt, however, was much too kind and tactful ever to mention the matter
but one needed only to imagine what sort of a storm would have erupted had anyone seriously attempted to disturb him in his drinking, to realize just how unfair and unreasonable such an objection was
and that word was—civilization!
hans castorp turned the puzzling object between his fingers
what blasphemous nonsense, ultimately, to measure the distance of some star or other from the earth in trillions of miles or even light-years and to imagine that by the ruse of numbers you had given the human spirit an insight into the nature of infinity and eternity—when infinity had absolutely nothing to do with size, nor eternity with duration and distances in time, had nothing in common with the notions of natural science, were the abrogation of what we meant by the word nature
kretzschmar admits as much, too, and says himself that one must, from
when he laughs, he draws air in between his clenched teeth in a series of jerking hisses
or was he simply feeling his oats?
the weather had taken a terrible turn for the worse
thomas was sixteen years old when he left school
beg your pardon, you were going to teach me more
having f o u r
the way you got from f to a major was very ingenious
like a plant, to use a metaphor, like a flower that has been transplanted to some foreign soil—though you may think the comparison inappropriate, because i’m an ugly old woman
he set to work with total devotion, imitating the quiet style and dogged industry of his father, who would often grind his teeth as he worked—and enter prayers for help in his diary
the signet ring with a green gemstone was even older, had presumably been worn by the very well-situated merchant tailor from rostock, and the consul had inherited it along with the large bible
pietism, true to its own enthusiasms, wanted, of course, to draw a sharp line between piety and science and claimed that no movement, no change in the realm of science can have any influence whatever on faith
it will be an honor
she hurried to the window
johann buddenbrook was greatly grieved by these less than admirable developments in his wife’s family and was therefore all the more anxious about his own children
they had apparently believed, moreover, that they were actually helping the malefactor
it was a good joke, the humor of the unfortunately sent him into convulsions
i was amazed and enchanted by the rendering of the sparks in the fire, by those entwining voices
even upstairs here, where there were only bedrooms, tony could smell coffee—that seemed to be the little house’s characteristic odor, and it grew stronger as she came down the staircase with its simple, unbroken wooden railing and followed the hallway that led past the parlor, the dining room, and the harbor pilot’s private office
to anyone they met he would-and she made no attempt to restrain him-extend a hand, while the person thus greeted and frau leverkiihn exchanged indulgent nods
oh, dear girl, that’s mere foolishness
it was wet snow, but it stuck, and the valley now lay under a thin, damp, tattered garment of white that made the rugged evergreen slopes stand out black in contrast
over her shoulder she said softly, don’t forget to return my pencil
but then you don’t need your rest cure as badly as i need mine
it was count strelitz, whose estate was gross-poggendorf—you’ve heard of him before, i’m sure
this outfit set the human grandeur of that head in strong relief against the pillow, in part lending it a less bourgeois, more working-class look, in part suggesting a sculptured, immortalized bust
and instead—clarity, serenity, a dry, austere charm
it seems to me you’re getting tangled up in contradictions
and i’ll have first rights over what assets are left
no, look, there in the foamy gray-green expanse as it loses itself, diminishing vastly against the horizon, there is a sail
since then, demand had grown considerably for second-floor apartments, from where, after climbing over the railing, one could avoid the little doors and move from room to room by way of the projecting glass roof of the veranda below
i am afraid of her bewilderment and of the-perhaps overhasty-rebuff that could result from it
beside the doctor sat herr and then frau magnus, who joined hands with a k ferge, who, if hans castorp was not mistaken, was linked to fräulein levi of the ivory complexion on his right—and so on
did we not, at the very moment of birth, stumble into agonizing captivity?
he merely told his pupil what adrian's own artistic sense could have or already had told him
as she walked she kept one hand in the pocket of her close-fitting wool jacket, while the other was busy at the back of her head, tucking and arranging her hair
as they gathered in concentric circles from all sides, it was as if they were thronging after him—hesitant, without a will of their own, and yet in dazed unanimity, like a swarm of rats behind the pied piper
we shall indeed strike them up for you, but only when you are ripe for the hearing
for instance, the eating of the book, which albrecht diirer boldly uses as the subject of one of his woodcuts, is taken almost verbatim from ezekiel, except for the one detail that in ezekiel's case the roll wherein was written lamentation and mourning and woe, tastes as sweet as honey in the mouth of him who obediently eats it
rhadamanthus had been a member of a dueling fraternity, but they could not possibly approach the head of the sanatorium and ask him to abet them in an illegal act, particularly since patients were involved
but to what end?
no objection to the status quo
, which with incredible artistic empathy conjures up the most cozily frightening and terrifying domains of the german folk song
that was schwerdtfeger; he could tell about it
old schwarzkopf had entertained them with sea yarns, and the younger one had told them about göttingen, where he was studying
his field of study had always been concerned with those dark, vast regions of the human soul that are called the subconscious, although one would perhaps do better to speak of the superconscious, since there are occasions when the knowledge that rises up from those regions far exceeds an individual’s conscious knowledge, suggesting that there may be connections and associations between the bottommost unlighted tracts of the individual soul and an omniscient universal soul
but i did walk rather far
but it soon turned out that this was not a temporary phenomenon, and it quickly become known around town that the consul’s wife, who as she had grown older had shown some sympathy for her late husband’s spiritual inclinations in the last years of his life, now intended to honor his memory by making his religious views totally her own
as i said, i have all kinds of deals in the making
but it didn’t help, she had to be given the sacrament of the dying
was he dealing with winter athletes, he asked, or patients, people who were ill?
what a strange feeling to watch this ambiguity coming from a king when the disputants began to speak of marriage and sin, the sacrament of indulgence, the guilt and innocence of lust
that made things hard for everyone involved, as she was sure the gentlemen could well understand, particularly hard if one came from an academic household and possessed the sensitivities of the upper classes
how inept of him, she thought
you must realize that it was not all that easy for him to be admitted to the site where the temple of humanity is being built, because he’s as poor as a church mouse, and they not only demand higher education, humanistic education, but, beg your pardon, one must also be well-to-do just to afford the hefty initiation fees and annual dues
please, don’t speak about it at least
oh, good lord, it’s the same everywhere
was that a wise thing to do?
i can’t go on, christian repeated, shaking his head back and forth with dreadful seriousness and letting his little, round, deep-set eyes wander about the room
it was close to noon when consul thomas buddenbrook entered the breakfast room and found his mother bent over a piece of paper, her spectacles set firmly on her nose
now, now, that’s enough, lad, go to sleep
and you didn’t even ask me?
that had been assigned to us and for which we (and we alone) marched off enthusiastically-filled with the certainty that the hour of germany's era had come, that history was holding its hand over us, that after spain, france, and england it was now our turn to put our stamp upon the world and lead it, that the twentieth century belonged to us, and that now that a bourgeois epoch had run its hundred-and-twenty-year course, the world was to be renewed under the emblem of germany, under the emblem of a militaristic socialism yet to be completely defined
sitting upright, her eyes wide open for battle, madame buddenbrook flailed her arms, as if grasping for support or hands that were reaching out to her, and constantly answered calls that came from all directions, which only she could hear, but which seemed to be growing ever more numerous and urgent
yes, monsignor hinterpfortner is right: we are lost
unable to make out the angle of decline, he let the slope pull him downward
amounted to formal goodbye
:rhough it pains me, i must add that he often misspoke himself and in the attempt to correct one such lapse (at which in my torment i dug my fingernails into my palms) made yet another, until in time he no longer paid any attention to such mistakes and simply passed over them
his trousers were an indefinite grayish green—and too short; they were apparently made of some strange stiff fabric, because the cuffs fell in unpleated circles around the short shafts of his broad boots
if my father ever learned about this, it would be a disaster
red wine and coffee were within reach as usual; the coffee things, splattered brown from recent use, stood on the chair beside the bed—mynheer had taken his usual afternoon cup, strong and hot, with sugar and cream, and he was still in a sweat from it
he was seven years old before he began to try arranging his hands on the keyboard in order to imitate certain combinations of sound that had impressed him
hanno hugged his grandmother, who pressed him gently to her; then she let him go and began to receive the thanks of everyone else
we shall have to arrange the details
dreadful indeed, herr grünlich responded, the fire was a terrible calamity, a heartbreaking ordeal
first came a work for an ensemble of three strings, three woodwinds, and piano-a rambling piece, if i may put it that way, with very long, extempore themes that undergo development and resolution in manifold ways, and yet never recur openly
since i am here, i replied, i will come along with you
and if i hesitate to pronounce those years as
what you just said came from the very depths of your personality, and even the present state of your personality found poetic expression
well, what about you, buddenbrook—you doing anything these days?
of course, papa, tony repeated in the reassuring tone that she almost always used if someone spoke to her about serious things
nice bunch of folks they have there
at the time she had been approached by a certain dr helmut institoris, an aesthetician and art historian, an instructor at the technical institute, where he would have photographs passed around the class while he lectured on the theory of the beautiful and the architecture of the renaissance, but a man with good prospects of one day being called to the university, to a professorial chair, to membership in the academy, etc, particularly if, being a bachelor from a well-to-do wiirzburg family and with expectations of a significant inheritance, he were to enhance the worthiness of his existence by establishing a household as a gathering place for society
who told you all this?
she went on, quite beside herself
neither of us has said a word, of course
in the spring of  , he went to vienna, where at ehrbar hall, as part of one of the so-called anbruch evenings, rudi schwerdtfeger at last gave his first performance of the violin concerto written for him-and with great success, in particular for him

i dropped a few hints, and it turned out he would be happy to have the lass stay with them a while
he had been awake for a good while when there was a knock at his door; it was shortly after two
against the shadowy moonshine of the romanticismo, which he had compared to luna, that pallid nun of heaven
oh, right, when the body goes stiff after death, hans castorp said cheerfully
for herr settembrini belonged to the francophile party in his homeland, which was in no way astonishing when one recalls that his grandfather had equated the days of the july revolution with the days of creation; but a pact between that enlightened republic and scythian byzantium was a moral embarrassment to him—his chest felt constricted, but then, at the thought of the strategic significance of those railroads, it would try to expand and take in rapid breaths of hope and joy
the situation was much less obvious as regarded the cousins; but despite her stupidity and ignorance, feminine intuition allowed her a certain insight, if only a partial and vulgar one
and yet absolute symmetry and icy regularity characterized each item of cold inventory
the shriveled old maid smiled in sympathy
and you will see people gather around peeperkorn, down to the last man, and naphta will be left sitting there alone with his cleverness and his city of god, although he can express himself so clearly that it makes your blood and spit run cold, to use one of behrens’s phrases
i forbid you to play so fast and loose with time!
they had returned to the adjoining room, and as they took their seats at the round table, the senator picked up the papers with the lists of things to be divided among the closest heirs
for weeks, my groping inquiries were countered with a half-playful silence, an annoyed, half-timid defensiveness that guarded some uncanny secret, with a smile and raised brows, with phrases like: mind your business and keep your soul clean!
her nose had something of a bump; the glance of her pale eyes, almost fully veiled by the lids, was subdued, soft, and mistrustful; a knowing and mournful glance, though not without sallies at roguishness
and when clavdia departed, i waited for her, just went on waiting up here, so that the flatlands is entirely lost to me now, and in its eyes i am as good as dead
i presume, by the way, that she’s wasting nitrogen by doing it, because she has to get a refill every week
both at the roddes' and in the schlaginhaufens' columned salon, people enjoyed listening to me play the viola d'amore, which to be sure was the chief social contribution that i, a simple scholar and schoolmaster and never a dashing conversationalist, could offer
she walked around with those good-natured blue eyes, that heavy braid, that broad mecklenburg accent—and never gave it a thought
we bought a couple of blankets for my cousin, joachim replied casually
that takes a little imagination, i’ll grant, a little idealism—and that’s what you lacked, whatever you may have believed about yourself
and yet, on the other hand, it’s as if i had been here not for just a day, but considerably longer—almost as if i had grown older and wiser, it seems to me
oh, there are times, friederike, when that is no comfort
it’s the first summer sign of the zodiac, you see
and yet life seemed to have actuated itself
that’s oxygen that you scent in the air
it was his way of honoring the stroll by the shore, the abiding ever-and-always, the hermetic magic, to which, once withdrawn from the world, he had proved so susceptible—the magic that had been his soul’s fundamental adventure, in which all the alchemistic adventures of that simple stuff had been played out
i had to laugh, for although the cold continued to press me, i was forced to admit that since his alteration i had grown more at ease in his company
for (and naphta was particularly fond of that conjunction—in his mouth it gained something triumphantly inexorable, and his eyes would flash behind his glasses whenever he could insert it), for politics and catholicism, as concepts, were psychologically related; they formed a single category embracing all objective, actual, active, actualizing reality, and as such stood in contradiction to pietist protestantism, which had emerged out of mysticism
at the time adrian particularly enjoyed the company of this elegantly rustic woman and in fact benefited from her calming presence, her protective energy as it were; and i have in fact seen him sit hand in hand with her in a corner of the abbot's study, gazing at her, saying nothing, as if safe and secure
years ago now—indeed, perhaps on the very day he was first voted into the senate—he had accomplished whatever could be accomplished
it is not without good reason that the faustus cantata is stylistically linked so strongly and unmistakably to monteverdi and the seventeenth century, whose music-again not without good reason-favored echo effects, at times to the point of mannerism
hans castorp quickly interrupted yet again
it was not exactly the same as asking a total stranger for a pencil—indeed, it would have been almost rude to pass stiffly by a lady with whom one had been living for months under the same roof and not salute her
but, as we have noted, when it came to the rest of the day’s sights and events, he had joachim provide him a report; he asked him about the festive outfits that had been brought out for sunday, the lace peignoirs and such (although it had turned too cold for lace peignoirs); about whether there had been any afternoon carriage rides (there had indeed—the entire half-lung club had left on an excursion to clavadel)
once it became clear that the doctors had left, word quickly spread that there would be dancing
the days passed—but then, suddenly, it looked as if there might be some happiness in store for her after all, the very same happiness for which they waited in vain on breite strasse and meng strasse
if i might make a suggestion, consul buddenbrook, this would be an excellent opportunity to prove the strength of the firm of johann buddenbrook
thilda is already busy in the kitchen, the consul continued, giving weight to each word, and i would be at work myself if it weren’t for an important matter that your mother and i would like to discuss with our daughter
they were all eating scrambled eggs and ham
all of these people, some thirty of them as i said, are now standing in the rustic salon, waiting expectantly, introducing themselves, sharing their curiosity with one another
what i do’ is what counts—and you will please take note of that
wenzel the czech was about to nod off
when he sat down to meals in the bright dining hall, young hans castorp found to his embarrassment that he was still subject to the grandfatherly tremor he had first noticed on his long, solitary walk
he noticed how he blushed and did not look up, and then did look up when the glass door slammed and frau chauchat glided to her seat
why, of course—for a couple of centuries, naphta affirmed coldly
the matter should be seen as follows
because over these last weeks such changes were much more visible than when he had first returned from the flatlands, and his tanned face was turning more yellow and leathery from day to day
don’t beat around the bush
i don’t mean being drunk, but what it’s like the next day
it was quieter here; he shared his retreat with only a few others
assist me, my child
and i’ve had a bellyful of it
for i did consider well that you must set pins if you would bowl, and now-a-days you must pay your addresses to the devil, in that you can use and have no one but him for great enterprises and work
but tell me one thing: if he’s so well taken care of by those people, why in the world would he live
don’t you mean, when he was painting your portrait?
there he must have made the discovery that music offered possibilities for expanding and fulfilling his spiritual kingdom of which young herr ludwig could scarcely have dreamt
narrative, however, has two kinds of time: first, its own real time, which like musical time defines its movement and presentation; and second, the time of its contents, which has a perspective quality that can vary widely, from a story in which the narrative’s imaginary time is almost, or indeed totally coincident with its musical time, to one in which it stretches out over light-years
the fact that he could have had all the amorous adventures he wished seemed to suffice for him, and it was as if he shied away from every tie to reality becau�e he saw it as robbing him of the potential
just watch, i’ll write as soon as i get there
i don’t know if i’m the only one to blame for that
and i know very well just what there was to me: i have been an intimate of sickness and death for a very long time, and even as a boy i borrowed a pencil from you, in the same irrational way i did again on that mardi gras night
the road they took, a small unrailed ledge between cliff and abyss, rose steeply into the evergreen wilderness
of course, i recognized you at once
it was now unbelievably warm, the heat was turned off, people left balcony doors open at night and it would still be fifty-seven degrees in their rooms the next morning; the snow was melting fast—turned ice-gray, became porous and honeycombed; great drifts of it sagged now, seemed to creep back into the earth
but the city itself didn’t have a penny and just muddled along, as my brother-in-law, permaneder, would say, and repairs were out of the question
but your poor cousin is seriously ill
i carry yours here
one would do well to disregard the nationalistic element in all this, dungersheim warned, and regard this complex of problems as bound up with the existence of modern man in general
he had gold-colored muttonchops; quite original—i’ve never seen the like
no need to worry, nurse schildknecht declared
but whether clouds or fog, the damp was penetrating
there was even some dancing on the glass floor-schildknapp and schwerdtfeger took turns gliding mlle
there they hang dry and elegant, enjoying universal respect
there, on the third morning after the argument, as soon as it was light enough, the issue was to be resolved
you will be received with the most intense interest
she should learn to close a door properly, hans castorp said
he was back on duty at the beginning of june, but by the middle of the month he had to rest on his oars again, and he complained bitterly about his bad luck; he could not hide his fears that he might miss taking part in major maneuvers in early august, to which he had so been looking forward
may i see you for a moment, gentlemen, please, he said and led them downstairs, across the corridor, and through the columned hall to the landscape room, where a fire was already burning because of the raw, damp autumn weather
thomas, for our dear lord’s sake, be fair to me, please
his kitchen and wine cellar were considered tip-top; he was admired as a polite, attentive, tactful host; and the wit he displayed in his toasts was well above average
she watched them wane; and whenever she felt up to it, she eagerly took the concentrated nourishment she was offered, was stricter than her nurses about the dosages and times of her medication, and was so caught up in it all that she spoke with hardly anyone but the doctors—or at least showed genuine interest only when conversing with them
his eyes were directed at the floor, too
at which point another , was sent gotthold’s way, and , to frankfurt: leaving, if one discounts the few thousand marks courant father left in his will to the holy ghost hospital, the businessmen’s widows fund, and so forth, approximately ,, plus another , from your dowry
we can only hope that she regained her strength once she joined her husband again by the baltic
let us not be irritable with one another, not today, not here, while in the very next room … go on, tom

what depresses you about it?
several people held their hands cupped to their ears; others merely held their hands up halfway, suggesting that the strain of concentration had frozen them in that pose

i need some time to outfit myself and take care of other matters
if for his part our good engineer has already voiced analogous opinions, that only confirms my surmise that, like so many talented young men, he is playing the intellectual dilettante, temporarily experimenting with possible points of view
the consul had just gone through several difficult and exhausting days
why no beer?—he had a slight temperature, hans castorp remarked casually—ninety-nine point seven, insignificant
in the cycle partly as an ensemble, partly solo, and even as a duet (sung by the two brothers)
there was no more exciting topic of conversation for the town
those were not subhuman creatures, herr settembrini informed him
the consul could not get his fill of staring at that profile
fräulein kleefeld announced knowingly
i am about to introduce into my narrative a figure such as a novelist would never dare present to his readers, since invisibility stands in apparent contradiction to the essentials of artistic endeavor, and so, too, of the novel
his eyelids were leaden; his tongue simply would not obey the simplest thoughts when he tried out of courtesy to chat with the englishwoman; even shifting the direction of his eyes demanded a great struggle with himself
one day herr settembrini saw him vanish in a burst of white fog; cupping his hands and calling after him to be careful, the contented pedagogue turned homeward
from then on he was part of the family
revival of an old french dance-he called it simply brilliant and deft in the very best sense
do not venture to measure what it would mean if in our extreme, singularly awful situation the dams were to break-as they are about to do-and there were no stopping the immeasurable hatred that we were adept at fanning up against us in the nations roundabout
brahms thought as little as possible of bruckner's symphonies; he called them formless giant serpents
they were fresh and alert, gay and merry, engaged with all their hearts and souls

and when he came back from the sea, his heartbeat was so calm, untroubled, and regular
their leading and spiritually most respected members lived celibate lives and were therefore honored with the name of solitary brothers and sisters
lads exercised trotting, whinnying, head-tossing horses, ran beside them, one hand on the halter, tugged at their long bridles when they reared, or rode them bareback, naked heels drumming at the animals’ flanks, out into the sea—and then the muscles of the boys’ golden-tan backs played in the sunlight and the cries they exchanged or shouted to the horses sounded inexplicably enchanting
we provide analysis, a chance to talk things out—and a hell of a lot of good it does
my god, you are the one to go, and not our lieutenant
raising their eyebrows, total strangers sitting nearby eavesdropped on the altercation, captivated by the passion and finesse of the interchange

he then laid both hands on his neighbor’s forearm, raised one forefinger with its lancelike nail, and, bathing in general approval, demanded they all pay particular attention to the splendid golden hue of the wine in their goblets, to the sugar sweated from the malaga grapes, to a particular kind of salt and poppy-seed pretzel, which he termed divine—and then with one peremptory cultured gesture nipped in the bud any objection to so forceful a word
i did indeed once suggest, if we wanted to be serious for a moment, that we consider whether or not a thinker, to whom the needs of the community might matter a great deal, would not perhaps do better to set truth rather than community as his goal, since indirectly and over time community is better served by truth, even by bitter truth, than by a mode of thinking that claims to serve it at the expense of truth, but in reality, by the very denial of the basis of genuine community, works from within in a most sinister fashion for its destruction
he had been spared any sight of the struggle, which had taken place primarily at night, and had been touched by it only indirectly—the anxious atmosphere in the house, old fiete’s reddened eyes, the comings and goings of doctors
we shall have crabs for lunch, herr permaneder, he went on, in high spirits himself
when it was all so marvelously remote, lost in the gray distance far beyond those four weeks
she bounced up, letting her feet drop over the edge of the bed, and now she started in—with flushed cheeks, scowling brows, and quick, abrupt motions of her head and hands
we perceive space with our senses, with vision and touch
probably the most distinctive characteristic was the prominent, high cheekbones: they pushed against her unusually wide-set eyes, flattening and lifting them at a subtle slant, and at the same time they were the reason for the soft concavity of her cheeks, which was, then, the direct cause for the slightly voluptuous pout to her lips
he had not returned to his former life, then, but had stayed on here—in part, to be sure, because he did not want to leave her grave behind; but the deciding, and less sentimental, factor had probably been that he had become slightly infected himself and, in his own professional opinion, actually belonged here
why do not you call me a coward straight-out!
and yet, figurez-vous, i have come to abduct you, to tempt you to be unfaithful for a time, to carry you off through the air on my cloak and show you the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and what is more, to lay them at your feet
no, no, i never managed anything more than a watercolor or two
economic space, however, is totally different from political, and there is no direct access from ideas of economic usefulness to a political consciousness related to history
this would decide herr modersohn’s future, his very existence
the consul never gambled
do you know the feeling, thomas, do you know it?
and before settembrini could rebuke him, naphta began to speak of pious excesses of charity witnessed in the middle ages, amazing examples of fanaticism and ecstasy in the care of the sick—the daughters of kings had kissed the stinking wounds of lepers, with the express purpose of becoming infected, had called the ulcerated sores to which they exposed themselves roses, had drunk the water with which they had bathed those festering bodies, and had declared they had never drunk anything so tasty
at first kai’s stories were short and simple; they soon grew bolder, however, and more complicated—and more interesting, because they were not pure fabrications but had some basis in reality, but a reality bathed in a strange and mysterious light
ah, it is hard, surrounded by such creatures
before the lecture, however, he did something quite perverse and ill advised: he took the notion of going for an extended walk all by himself, which turned out bad beyond all expectation
this was how joachim put it—and it pained everyone to see this gentle, sedate young man in open rebellion
he did not like it there and wrote plaintive letters to his family expressing a strong desire to leave the institution, where they apparently were very strict with him, and to live as a free man again
coffee had been served unusually late, and they went on sitting there for a long time, too
smoking his cigarettes, thomas looked about attentively whenever they passed a field of grain and apprised herr permaneder of how each was doing
he had not looked up from his musical notations
he had taken it with him to the garden, and now, deeply engrossed, he turned page after page
but there he suffered such an awful embarrassment that he did know himself what face to put on
we accused hans castorp before of being uninhibited, but whatever the aim of his desires, a social acquaintance with frau chauchat was not what he had in mind, and he was in fundamental agreement with those circumstances that worked against it
can the reckoning square of numbers be far behind?
inez rodde-now rich, socially secure, and cushioned against lifehad adopted the knoterichs from the little clique of her mother's former salon guests and made them part of her and her husband's own social circle, along with, for instance, dr kranich the numismatist, schildknapp, rudi schwerdtfeger, and myself-though not zink and spengler or the theatrical, artistic crowd who had been clarissa's fellow students-supplementing them with academic types, older and younger docents and their wives from both universities
the instrumentation for this dance of
he may have had some trouble, then, in following the conversation that took place after this intimate performance in the abbot's study
it looked for a moment as if he was tempted to shake my hand but then refrained
well, wait and see, you’ve only just arrived
are you well satisfied?
she said, hastily countering a gesture morten had made
it was really much wiser to stick to one’s guns, the way she did—she, too, had a life down in the flatlands, in cannstatt, to be precise, a husband and two children, but she knew how to contain herself
are the netherlands still waiting in vain for you to represent them, tom, my boy?
he must be out to make me his personal target; he blocks me whenever he can
how did one look into the heart and mind of a man who dissembled and denied?
and he turned to ask this question politely and gently of the dwarf
on the whole, as was to be expected, the will’s provisions were aimed at keeping the estate together as best as possible, making frau elisabeth buddenbrook virtually the universal heir and retaining all assets within the business—in which regard, herr marcus gave notice that as a partner he would be strengthening the firm’s capital by , courant
my general knowledge allowed me to link the term light-year
like churlish dross, a bawd, an utter pimp-master, is how you look, is the guise you thought to put on to visit me-but no angel!
he bent a metaphorical knee before hermes trismegistos, the humanistic hermes, the master of the palaestra, whom mankind could thank for the sublime gift of the literary word, of agonistic rhetoric
when the rest of the party, laden with large sacks of gingersnaps, emerged from the shop, thomas let his eyes drift discreetly over their heads—they were both obviously very embarrassed
excuse me a moment
the germans should allow the jew to play the mediateur between them and society, to be the manager, the impresario, the agent of germanness-the jew is definitely the man for the job, he should not be sent packing, he is international, and he is pro-german
they were all permanent residents, either firmly rooted or at least of very long standing, like dr ting-fu and wenzel the bohemian, whom he met on the stairs, and the group they greeted in dr krokowski’s office: herr ferge and herr wehsal for instance, the prosecutor, the ladies levi and kleefeld, not to mention those who had told him about the apparition of holger’s head, and, of course, the medium herself, elly brand
i must, however, assert that i consider the manner in which you have chosen to widen the lamentable rift separating us to be a sin for which one day you shall indeed be called to answer before the judgment seat of god
on one finger could be seen the bright green gemstone of the large signet ring he had now inherited
i’m a civilian, more or less responsible for myself
in the middle of the street, at home with her family, at the dinner table—she would think of them
if i have inwardly shrunk away from you, it was because i had to protect myself from you, because your nature and character are a danger to me
and, oh, if only herr settembrini had not had reason to fear hans castorp would find it all worth listening to
let us all eat, drink, and chat, and let sorrow take care of itself
it seems to me as if this would not be all that contrary to the wishes of my late friend
the young man with the moustache entered again, his chin pressed to his chest, and sat down with a worried, self-absorbed look on his face
the world was being turned upside down
herr köppen’s ponderous voice carried over the general table conversation
german it is not, but humane
in the middle of the room, however, was dr
i am certainly no homme de génie by birth, any more than i am a man of stature—good god, no
zounds, my good engineer
i chose an obsolete and not unprejudicial term for such endeavors, however, because there was evident in them a certain trace of mysticism, which at one time would have been suspect as an interest iri sorcery
the sky had clouded over completely again
my poor boy, she thought, and watched while her poor boy abandoned himself to exuberant exchanges with his cousin, reliving a hundred memories, asking a hundred questions, and throwing himself back in his chair with a laugh at every answer
he spoke so low that one could only barely understand him, forcing words between his teeth, as he usually did when he had a headache
we laughed, and our goodbye-for i had to make my train-was easy and cheerful
and that would in fact be a release, but only for him, not for her—sister berta was her name, by the way, or more accurately, alfreda schildknecht—because she would only move on then to another patient in a more or less advanced stage of the illness, here or at some other sanatorium
as if by tacit agreement, neither of them ever mentioned the lecture again
we’re sitting here just chatting, but in fact i’ve come to see you this evening about a very serious and important matter
and so, instead, they stimulated her heart with various drugs and induced vomiting several times, which brought some momentary relief
both sisters trusted me, which is to say: they appeared to value me as someone justifiably capable of evaluating others, which, however, if the trust is to be complete, also demands a certain standing-apart from the game, an unruffled neutrality
i didn’t suspect anything definite, she stammered
(and automatically he drawled the last word out sleepily, as if he were stretching and yawning)
'like' is not quite the right word
schwerdtfeger stopped and stared at the man who had spoken these words, first into one eye, then the other
starting up from my book, i gaze out into the chamber, see that sch
beware—its lead may prove deceptive
take this note or this one
time—not the sort that train station clocks measure with a large hand that jerks forward every five minutes, but more like the time of a very small watch whose hands move without our being able to notice, or the time grass keeps as it grows without our eyes’ catching its secret growth, until the day comes when the fact is undeniable—time, a line composed of elastic turning points (and here the late, ill-fated naphta would presumably have asked how purely elastic points can ever begin to form a line), time, then, had continued to bring forth changes in its furtive, unobservable, secret, and yet bustling way
and wading through snow was just as difficult as wading through sand dunes, except when the sun melted the surface during the day and it froze hard again at night: then you moved across it as lightly as across a parquet floor—it was the same easy, pleasant feeling you got walking over the smooth, firm, springy, salt-rinsed sand at the edge of the sea
the oxygen tonic of life in the open air, the impressions of the landscape and its history, exhilarated these young men and raised their spirits to those lux-
farm to offer my sad congratulations on his fiftieth birthday
hans castorp had them bring him tea, and he dunked zwieback in it
he also traveled to mittenwald, the village of violin-makers at the upper end of the isar valley, where an apothecary devoted to the same hobby lived and, with the help of his wife and talented sons, put on puppet shows in the style of pocci and christian winter, attracting a large audience of both locals and outsiders
frau ziemssen gave the impression that she had run here all the way from hamburg
in short and plain, metaspirochaetosis, that is the menengial process
the walls were painted with a hard, glistening white enamel
lord, you could decorate your house so splendidly
could not be forceful enough in its rejection of any dealings with workers' and soldiers' councils or similar such bodies, could not remonstrate enough that peace could be concluded only with a stable germany, that only such a germany would be fed
they both enjoyed, however, their visits with anton karlovitch ferge from saint petersburg, a fellow with a huge good-natured moustache and a protruding adam’s apple that somehow seemed equally good-natured; he lay there in his bed, recovering very slowly and with great difficulty from an attempted pneumothorax, which, herr ferge said, had come within an inch of costing him his life
the intent apparently is to conjure the element of sin, of sensuality, of evil lust right out of marriage-for lust exists surely only if the flesh is twofold, not one, which means that to say they are to be one flesh is mollifying nonsense
he was working on a suite of dramatic grotesques, whose subjects, so we were told, were taken from an old book of anecdotes and tales, the gesta romanorum, and was having a go at them without
young hans castorp felt invigorated by the beautiful morning
you can be sure of it!
i would make it part of me, so i could play it in my sleep, and cherish and coddle every note like a mother, because i would be it's mother, and you would be the father-it would be like a child between us, a platonic child-yes, our concerto, that would truly be the fulfillment of everything the word 'platonic'
when one day is like every other, then all days are like one, and perfect homogeneity would make the longest life seem very short, as if it had flown by in a twinkling
they casually drifted away again
settembrini asked, and with such earnest expectation of an answer that hans castorp found himself forced to admit that this was the first he had heard of it
she would say with a deep, doleful voice rough as desert winds, and even when one asked her, how are you ?
hermann’s brother, moritz, had been an unusually successful student—despite his bad lungs—and established a law office in town
have you lost your senses?
and in between she’s somewhere else, at other places like this
the will no longer triumphed
god gives the strength to some, and not to others
jean, you can guide our guests out to the back
good god in heaven, don’t you understand?
but no sooner am i finished than i have to ask myself what’s up
needless to say, he had only read about these things, had acquired the appropriate books and fed his imagination with them; but whether he was so committed to the subject and thus retained its images so clearly, or whether it was simply some whim or other, he pretended that he had made the descent himself-in the area of the bermudas to be precise, several sea miles east of st george, where the natural fantastic phenomena of the abyss had been shown him by a companion named capercailzie, whom he described as an american scholar and with whom he claimed to have set a new record for depth
what do you mean rose up’?
and as always when hans castorp listened to this aria, deep emotions stirred within him, strengthened this time by certain possibilities that were compacted into a wish, and he thought, idle and sinful or not, it would certainly be wonderfully strange and a very special adventure
he departed, and his traveling companion unfortunately was not i, who had barely been able to get away from official duties for the concert; nor this time was it rudiger schildknapp, he of the same-colored eyes, who had not even bothered to come to
to be frank, i must admit that it seems to me that music only really begins for the soloist when he has achieved a very high degree of skill
there was the same coming and going between his quarters and mine that there had once been between the blessed messengers and his uncle's house-both of an evening, whether returning from the theater, a concert, or the winfried fraternity, and of a morning, when one would stop by for the other and we would compare notes before setting out for the university
the dog days had come late—it was already the second week in september—and summer lay over the city more oppressively than in july
using informal pronouns, he now continued, we welcome you most heartily, good fellow
just imagine, one evening at an operetta—it was in london—the curtain went up when i was still out on the stage
adrian refused to accept the term
i know that before composing the piece, leverkiihn made a careful study of the treatment of the violin by beriot, vieuxtemps, and wieniawski, and applied all this in a style that was half-respectful, halfcaricaturing-and which, by the way, made such technical demands on the soloist (especially in the extremely rollicking and virtuoso second movement, a scherzo, where there is a quote from tartini's devil's trill sonata) that our good rudi had to summon his utmost skill to do them justice
adrian could be certain that elsbeth leverkiihn had taken this death with the same quiet composure, the same understanding acceptance of human mortality, as had mother schweigestill
it seemed to have satisfied him, to have actually done him good, finally to have made his brother angry, to have at last enabled him to react vigorously and raise some protest
why not another week yet?
to which is added:
a few months would have to pass before i followed his call, i had nonetheless been immediately prepared to do so-indeed, it might not even have required his invitation
and y’ certainly wouldn’t read no telegram while you’re eatin’, sure as hell wouldn’t
no accommodation, no concessions to scientific criticism can help
the passage is very funny, especially since it is the women, the vulgar, and the illiterate who rebel against this invention and insist that they be allowed to
i took the liberty of paying my respects to your good mother and was grieved to find you weren’t at home
it was too dark in the carriage to make out the expression on his face
positioned between east and west, it will have to choose, will have consciously to decide, once and for all, between the two spheres vying for its heart
and soon did parley with him, that killjoy, that bawd, in an italian chamber, had intercourse with him, who had much to convey to me of hell's quality, fundament, and substance
he is inward-looking, intellectually inclined, averse to sensual things, in my opinion
good man alive, my best wishes for good results
oh, it’s just an expression—a figure of speech
he shook his head, repeatedly thrusting one index finger at the ground, and his ragged lips parted with considerable effort to form the word here!
it was the healthiest of all
has he finally gone off the deep end?
i know how very much you contributed to making her stay in munich so pleasant and enjoyable
ah, how they all wanted to hear some of his poetry
i was surely born for it!
prosecutor paravant, who was severely afflicted, threw himself into math—he’s busy squaring the circle these days, and it has greatly eased his problem
the sun shone, it was a beautiful, bright day; but it had been a good idea to put on spring overcoats—the drive would be cool, no doubt
but the loveliest thing about her was her voice, a warm mezzo-soprano, and when she employed it for speech, colored with a touch of a thuringian accent, it was extraordinarily winning
oh, i’ll have none of your fate!
he mounts the stairs in triumph, waving a stack of programs in his hand
but that hearth enables you to perceive me and without it, surely, you would see me not
hans castorp peered in as they passed, and discovered them empty
they were in their element then, whereas stature was not, and one could at least be of differing minds as to what role it actually did play
couldn’t you have told me that before now?
he thought it up just now,
but please don’t misunderstand me—that does not mean that i consider myself an angel and free of all guilt
in that case it’s ever so much better never to marry
but i fear it will be the only thing i can do for you
joachim had been given roses
i, on the other hand, declare that the issue of freedom—or, to put it more concretely, the issue of cities—as highly moral an issue as it may be, is historically associated with a most inhuman degeneration of economic morality, with the many horrors of modern marketeering and speculation, with the satanic rule of money, with commerce
one should love them
already on the second reading, i found it quite remarkable that the style, this burlesque or personal adaptation of kumpfian antiquated german, lasts only until the adventure is told and is afterward casually dropped, so that its color is bleached out of the concluding pages, which display a modern verbal character
dark blue smudges of congested blood on clarissa's beautiful hands and face suggested a rapid death by suffocation, the abrupt paralysis of the breathing mechanism by a dose of cyanide that could easily have killed a company of soldiers
and so she inspected apartments, consulted with jakobs the upholsterer, negotiated with shopkeepers about portieres and carpet runners
but it would be a very unusual arrangement for our kind of house, he said
tony’s tears suddenly ceased
he asked sympathetically and sat down gently beside hanno on the bench
even pastor pringsheim sits there sipping at the layer of cool whipped cream above the hot chocolate; he is still dressed in his ruff and long robe, his broad, shiny black boots sticking out from under the hem, and he chats away with that same transfigured face, but in an easy conversational tone that is much more effective than his homily
them); the hopes that the world wanted to place in you after your first, comparatively gentle collapse, after the abdication of the kaiser's empire; the hopes that for a few years-despite your rowdy behavior, despite the totally mad, fiercely desperate, wildly demonstrative bloating of your misery, that inflation of currency scrambling drunkenly skyward-you seemed to justify to some extent
washed by surging tides, and there, once fetters have been placed on his feet and the key flung into the sea, gregory spends seventeen years of penitence, at the end of which there comes an overwhelmingthough he, it seems, finds it hardly surprising-elevation by grace
but the consul’s wife said, when we use such words, christian, the lord punishes us with even worse sickness!
he is an angel now, sesame corrected her
in that regard, it was herr settembrini who was pious and strict, and naphta who was lax and slovenly, referring truth back to man and declaring that whatever profited man was true
nothing left unsaid gnawed at her; no unspoken emotions weighed her down
people left him in peace—rather like a student who enjoys the peculiarly amusing situation of no longer being asked questions, of not having to do any work, because the decision has already been made to hold him back and so he is no longer in the running—an orgiastic sort of freedom, we may add, while asking ourselves whether there can be freedom of any other sort
i won’t do that, let me tell you
it’s possible i’ll not be able to stay on, that i’ll have to leave—would you be offended?
in fact, the moment conversation turned to his late father, he was obviously embarrassed and uneasy, and it seemed that he feared not just some indelicate expression of deep or solemn emotion, but that he feared and avoided all feeling
thomas stopped to point up at the pole and wreath with his walking stick
he asked as they walked across the entrance hall
outlined against the blue were the unchanged hallmarks of schiahorn, green towers, and dorfberg—joachim’s eyes rested on them
young count mölln had to walk a good distance by himself after that, all the way to his father’s manor house
in short, it bothered me
others emerged to be considered
on the way home, he got joachim to agree that official channels should be opened to deal with his cold and sore throat—this meant asking the bath attendant to inform the head nurse, which would then result in something being done for his sufferings
that comes from the asiatic east and her illness, hans castorp replied
it’s hard to imagine what it would be like to touch human skin without greasy cholesterol
where the bee sucks, there suck i, in a setting for soprano, celesta, muted violin, oboe, muted trumpet, and the flageolet tones of the harp-and truly anyone hearing these gently spiriting sounds, even if only with his mind's ear by reading them, may well ask with ferdinand in the play, where should this music be?
now, why was that?
you need only glance out the window when i’m done, senator
and—bang!—a bullet had struck him right in the head
clarissa was hoping to make her way
you can’t suppose i’ve been struck blind and can’t see how things stand
and so when i say strep,   behrens began anew, you should not picture the standard severe symptoms, of course
a little caution is in order—you can’t light one from the other
the noise level in the classroom did not diminish in the least when the bell rang for fourth period
in his jargon, they were dealing with biopsychic projections of subconscious complexes into the objective world, processes whose source one should attribute to the medium, a person whose constitution was in a somnambulant state; one might speak of such events as objectified dreams to the extent that they demonstrated an ideoplastic capability in nature—the capacity of thoughts, under certain conditions, to assume substance and thus reveal themselves in ephemeral reality
with her head laid back and both arms stretched straight ahead or straight up, she spoke out of anger, resentment, out of genuine, deeply felt outrage
life’s not all that bad here, after all—and a little courtesy is in order
the columned hall was the setting for the wedding, just as on that day long ago when frau grünlich had worn the myrtle
not for another twelve, thirteen minutes
a little mountain air in bad kreuth or a little sea air in glücksburg or travemünde doesn’t seem to have had any effect
been under consideration for a long time now
i cannot always be taking care of the child
take a train sometime from leuna to halle
but i wasn’t using it, he suddenly shouted to the whole room
and in response to fräulein engelhart, who without looking at him asked, with a dull blush and a skewed smile, how he liked their new guest, he said with perfect equanimity that mynheer peeperkorn was a blurred personality—a personality, true, but a blurred one
a quick knock—and she went straight from the hallway to her brother’s office
our nackedey and kunigunde rosenstiel took turns calling at pfeiffering
what do you want?
where was all this getting him?
now he leaned back and ran the tips of his mustache through his fingers, lost in thought
she came here with thomas, twenty-one years ago now, and we have all loved her, although she probably always thought of us as something of a bother
adam weishaupt modeled his humanitarian secret society strictly on the jesuit order
frau ziemssen—a sensible, reasonable, though in no way sanguine lady—took the director aside and suggested the fall, october perhaps, as a date for joachim’s discharge, and behrens agreed with her to the extent that by then one would at least be further along than one was at present
but is that any comfort when you are lying open-eyed at midnight and, alone and without advice from anyone, you must answer yes or no, must decide the one question that will determine the rest of your life—and not just your life alone?
they came in beautiful enameled boxes with gilt depictions of a globe, lots of medallions, and an exposition hall with banners flying
all of that was pleasant
quickly closing the door with both hands and without looking around, hans castorp turned now to the right, toward the door with the thumbtacked calling card; with a kind of forward rocking motion, he reached it in a few soundless strides
no, clavdia, you know perfectly well that what you say is not true and is spoken without conviction, of that i am certain
you’re probably unfamiliar with de miseria humanae conditionis by innocent the third—a very witty literary work, from the end of the twelfth century
sit venia verbo, into mere begging, into a plea for mercy, an  oh, lord and god, take pity, into a help me and give me and be so good as to
muted chords of a chorale drifted toward him; a march followed after a brief pause
that’s pure sluggishness, the italian replied
ah, the masses are ignorant, i know that
the tension was palpable
are you trying to tease me, fräulein buddenbrook?
moreover, he had to play for a subscriber's concert of the zapfenstosser orchestra that same evening, something to which adrian had not even given a thought
its rough plank walls were full of carved inscriptions, initials, hearts, and poems
i discovered an exotic old tome on his desk, a thirteenthcentury french rendition in verse of the vision of st paul, the greek text of which goes back to the fourth century
but lodovico settembrini spoke, too, about himself and his origins when he was alone with the cousins—during walks or at the evening gatherings or after the noonday meal when a large majority of patients had already left the dining hall and the three gentlemen remained seated at one end of the table for a while as dining attendants cleared dishes and hans castorp smoked a maria mancini, which by the third week had regained some of its flavor
hans castorp could only smile at it—but he bent down over his knees to hide his smile and experienced the inner glow of joy
damages of  million, and the figures are a rather precise calculation
i’ve a business matter to discuss, and if i might ask the good consul to join me for a walk in the garden …
why are you so upset?
and he found himself transported to an earlier stage of life, one which only a few nights before had served as the basis for a dream filled with more recent impressions
the bones protruded above his sunken cheeks, and his naked, fleshless, gaunt nose jutted out between them in one huge hook
hanno buddenbrook had nothing to fear from him and was almost never asked a question
there was no other way to put it, the word itself said it all
determined not to hear any more, he turned and opened the door
he stuck out his hand decisively, as if to say, be quick about it, please
i was under the impression that you had sheets of them folded up and tucked away in a little pocket of your wallet, all arranged according to denomination
the good of all is the fundamental principle of our brotherhood
of late, he had begun to get a little stout—the only part of his carefully groomed exterior that betrayed the advance of years
she had locked the girl in her room for now, until this man of the world was gone
but even so, what was such ignorance in comparison with our confusion when confronted by phenomena like memory—or the even more astounding extended memory that allowed acquired characteristics to be inherited?
he usually ate his midday meal with adrian, in the hoftheater restaurant or in one of the beer cellars in the center of town, but very soon, putting his leipzig connections to good use, he gained entree to private homes and managed to have a table set here and there for him at noontime (not to mention evening invitations)-after a shopping trip, perhaps, with the lady of the house, who found his gentlemanly poverty fascinating
a high-flown conversation often passed right over their heads without their much caring-they would pretend to listen in smiling modesty or earnest astonishment
as hans castorp passed through the door with the calling card tacked decoratively to it, he found the nordic child already under the doctor’s wing
well, what is herr von maiboom’s problem?
settembrini responded with a subtle remark: it seems some generalizations reflect on the person making them
that, too, my lad
now would i make cordial christian request of you that you not take and judge my discourse to the worse, but that it be understood to the best, for verily i have a longing to make full and fellowly confession to you, who are good and unharmful and, if not unsinful, sinful but in such common and tolerable wise that i do heartily detest, yet fervently envy you, for the hour-glass stands before my eyes so that i must needs behold when the last grain has run through the bottle neck and he will fetch me to whom i have pacted myself so dearly with my own blood that i shall eternally belong to him body and soul and fall into his hand and dominion when the glass has run out and time, being his ware, is come to its end
when he did receive her, or if they happened to meet outdoors, she would tell him about her daughters, making sure to keep her lips closed over a gap in her front teeth when she laughed; for this, too, and not just her hairline, was now a source of worry to make her flee the company of others
but then, when uncle justus began pouring some oily, yellow greek wine in the smallest glasses and the iced meringues appeared—red, white, and brown—his appetite returned
then he spits tobacco juice at his feet, because in this crowd there is no way he can shoot in a wide arc, hitches up his trousers by the belt with both hands, and goes on: hagenström, he’s such a tub o’lard he can’t even breathe through his nose right, that’s how fat he is
herr kesselmeyer asked, wrinkling up his nose and staring through his pince-nez
and now give me the letters from clara and the pastor
she had known all along that herr permaneder had none of the industriousness that her first husband had displayed far too much of
oh, sometimes it’s much worse
the boy ahead of him was hans hermann kilian, a small fellow with brown, greasy hair and broad shoulders
this was a strange wax doll, and there was something gruesome about the way they had dressed it up for this ceremonial occasion
invitations were declined on the telephone by his faithful landlady, or were simply left unanswered
she was a fairly cheeky young thing, whose high spirits had caused her parents, in particular the consul, considerable worry, and although she was bright enough and could quickly learn anything demanded of her in school, her behavior was so unsatisfactory that the principal, one fräulein agatha vermehren, finally had to visit meng strasse and, though perspiring with embarrassment, politely suggested to the consul’s wife that her young daughter be given a serious reprimand—for despite many well-intended warnings she had once again been guilty of a flagrant piece of mischief right out on the street
i’m merely visiting my cousin ziemssen for a few weeks and using the occasion for a little relaxation myself
but just wait, if you had been there, you wouldn’t know what kind of face to put on, either, thinking back on it
gentlemen, the historical connection between humanism and pedagogy only proves the psychological basis of that connection
and all the while he gets harsher and harsher in his demands that erika be cheerful and keep his mind off his worries
but there was something else as well that made my heart beat so strangely with joy and doubt, for on my next visit to pfeiffering adrian let drop some remarks to the effect that he had perhaps lived here for too long a time, that changes in the externals of his life were possibly at hand, that if need be his loner's solitude might quickly come to an end, that he was toying with a plan to make an end of it, etc-in short, remarks whose only possible explanation was that he intended to marry
over long complex passages, all three are superimposed, until finally, and indeed in a triumphant fashion that electrifies every concert audience, the c minor declares itself openly
he said, directing his pop-eyes at the wall clock
but, to judge from her husband’s letters, her health was not of the best; and the headaches from which she had suffered as a child now appeared with periodic regularity and had grown almost unbearable
next to the stairs stood a couple of enormous old cupboards and a carved chest
no, it never entered his mind to seek out a real acquaintanceship
ah, yes, they may well prove to be fascinarii, our revellers-in better cases, such as yours
and that encoded sound reads as: h-e-a-e-es: hetaera esmeralda
well, that certainly makes a botch of the property
he had long since proved what a tough cavalier he was—it was hard to know what he had used to breathe with toward the end
and the rest of the day was so free and had no real schedule, a wonderful lazy and coddled life of ease that passed serenely and without a care
their fruit should, can, and will be a humanism colored by religion and defined by a sense of man's transcendental mystery, by proud awareness that he is not merely a biological creature, but rather that a decisive part of his nature belongs to a spiritual and intellectual world; by awareness that the absolute has been given him-concepts of truth, of freedom, of justice-that he has been charged with the duty of approaching what is perfect
her aunt, he said, knew that he was here and would join them after he had spoken with her about a very important, very serious, and lovely matter
the consul smiled again
costs little or nothing, a mere nineteen pfennigs, natural color, but an aroma that you don’t normally find at the price
so that was your first night up here
since our intent all along has been to make him no better or worse than he was, it should also be noted that when poor wehsal approached him privately one evening and begged with ashen words for god’s sake to please tell him in strict confidence about his experiences that night of the mardi gras party, hans castorp had complied with calm charity, although, as the reader can well imagine, he did not permit anything the least bit base or frivolous to sully that hushed scene
and now you’re starting in on humanity,  just like settembrini
you see in me a man, father, who has struggled tirelessly against fate, but who has at last been struck down
she had been with the buddenbrooks for twenty years now and was proud of how indispensable she was
he spoke very forcefully and with unusual coherence about medicines and poisons, and hans castorp tilted his head and nodded as he listened, less concerned with the contents of what was said, which seemed very important to the dutchman, than with quietly exploring the effects of the man’s personality, which ultimately was as inexplicable as the effects of snake venoms
on the third day, however, it was as if nature had taken a tumble—everything was turned upside down
but now tell me, how are you?
others claimed to have seen little flecks of white light, shifting points of concentrated energy that had appeared repeatedly along the folding screen
it was just before the presents were to be given out
he had a droll plattdeutsch comment to add for every shot, and now and then he cheerily recited to himself: as maréchal saxe …
what would a woman like her do with children?
and herr albin pointed with his index finger to his close-cropped blond head
he spoke somewhat ponderously and his voice was a little scratchy
and he was evidently not in the least embarrassed by it; on the contrary, he luxuriated grandly in it and took royal delight in jostling his escorts to the right or left as he tottered along
ah, and so you have already made his acquaintance?
the fancy cannot cheat so well as she is fam would to do, deceiving elf
she wept bitterly when the time came to say farewell to her little johann
and there in the back row, a head and a pair of shoulders emerged—it was kai, count mölln
tony thought: how does he know my parents so well?
he was swamped with private and public duties
he laughed and said again, come on, get off, don’t be shy!
it is sufficient that, supported and strengthened by them, i intend to remain true to my enterprise
the rain went on for days, it poured one whole week, and without the compensations of the lounge chair it would have been very hard to spend so many hours reclining out there, your face numbed and wet from the damp murk of clouds
isn’t it remarkable, morten, how you can’t get bored at the beach?
dr krokowski was in professional uniform as well, except that his smock was more shirtlike, with elastic at the wrists, and of a black, shiny fabric that only emphasized his pallor
hans castorp let his head fall briefly, but then sat up straight again and took a deep breath
good lord, i would not have you believe i consider myself too good for any profession
but it is an abstraction in about the same way as the naked body is abstract-it's practically genitalia
it was a great joy to hear him call something true; it was an anchor, a stay-one no longer asked oneself quite in vain about the
with gestures of refined clumsiness, sometimes stroking gently over the thick hair at temples and nape
one day he had insisted that, instead of walking along the mühlenwall, hanno come with him to his father’s farm to see some newborn guinea pigs, and fräulein jungmann had finally given in to their pleas
what i mean is
fury, the cerebral achievement that it represents, as it is for the unanticipated mixing of sounds that an incomparable fantasy for combination, that an ear eager to hear what has never been heard before has wrested from all three instruments
and how will art live as comprehension?
because he had also hired a chauffeur to drive him to his office, and that young man, nothing special except he looked awfully dapper in his braided livery, had done wrong by the young lady, making her lose her head
once again the technician in his white smock opened the door
he would speak of dos banderas, of the two flags to which armies rallied for the great struggle—the flags of heaven and hell, the former in the region of jerusalem, with christ as the capitán general commanding the armies of the good, and the latter on the plains of babylon, with lucifer as caudillo or chieftain
and now what happened is this
to be sure, he could not then count on being fetched at the station by the schweigestill's vehicle; in such cases advance arrangements could be made with a livery service in waldshut
fat lüders stood up
throughout the district, he was thought of as someone special, and not just by those of his own creed, as someone who knew more than others—about religious matters in part, but also about other things that made him seem a little uncanny, or at the least, out of the ordinary
ultimately dubious was the legitimacy and relevance of her homesickness for a bourgeois world
you had a headache not long ago, too, didn’t you?
she was explaining that she knew how to prepare twenty-eight different sauces for fish—and she would stake her reputation on the fact, although her husband had warned her not to speak about it
there was no baron riedesel to advocate things  graceful; the piano-playing cavalryman had vanished through history's trapdoor
this is the typical mode of experience of someone lost in a mountain snowstorm, who never finds his way home, he thought as he struggled along, the phrases emerging in tattered, breathless fragments—discretion forbade his putting it more explicitly
he kept coming out into the corridor to cry every few minutes, like a little boy
but for now, there was a succession of beautiful october days—days like the one on which the cousins had viewed the director’s oil paintings
i refused him, i could not bring myself to consent to his proposal of marriage
well, allow me then to offer my most heartfelt congratulations
why, you could marry one of my brothers, for example
his offer was refused
we wrote it down in our oilcloth-bound notebooks so that, more or less consoled, we could carry it home
his acclimatization was complete, he had no more visions, his body no longer lay inert on the bench while his innermost self wandered in some distant present—nothing of that sort happened
he could not give the results of this meeting a very high rating
and however cold it got—and it did get very cold—there was no point in his taking refuge in the room, because as long as it wasn’t snowing, there was no heat, so that it was no more comfortable for him to sit in his room than to put on a winter overcoat, artfully wrap himself in his two good camel-hair blankets, and lie out on the balcony
dr blumenkohl, who had been doing very poorly again of late, muttered something to himself—with a look on his face, or better, about his lips, that was peculiarly his own—that indicated the source of these verses
ah, clavdia, why not?
i have my shortcomings, and i’m quite certain that i didn’t always do the right thing
what does it matter?
they were about to stand out of respect, but he told them to remain seated
and that clearly meant that his freedom, like naphta’s truth, was tied to just one thing: man
beyond the town, the road became a mountain path that led past a capuchin monastery to the scant remains of an acropolis at the peak, next to which were also the ruins of an ancient theater
indeed, one has the impression you have made a bet with madame, a philopena, by the terms of which you are never to address her directly
didn’t i possess it?
he wrote on sanatorium stationery, taken from an ample supply in his table drawer, to james tienappel, the uncle to whom he felt closest of the three, and asked him to inform the consul
i was paying attention, you see, but none of it was clear
petersen went limp, his face turned gray
was there any point in her wearing gossamer sleeves so that men would be curious about her body—about her diseased body?
people rummaged in their limited knowledge of human nature and found dusty clichés by which to measure senator buddenbrook’s wife: still waters run deep, or butter wouldn’t melt in her mouth
just this visit of ours did me some good
oh, right, you are in hops, herr permaneder
she was met with anxious agreement, which adrian noticed now with some surprise, since he had not heard the original question
a servant arrived with whisky, beer, and soda water on a large tea tray
then, when aunt lottie had closed the door behind her and vanished, he said more softly, you can put those away now, anna
he had to laugh at the term, bending over as he walked and laughing down at the wet sidewalk
the yellow mouthpiece of a russian cigarette he had already finished wandered nervously from one corner of his mouth to the other
believe me, pfühl, this music is much less foreign to your inner nature than you think
but who would deny that it can also be instructive just to hear of a great unfamiliar work?
they simply struck up silent night, holy night, all by themselves in the salon, after which therese weichbrodt read the christmas story with very precise diction—taking gerda’s place, because she did not particularly enjoy that sort of thing
and joachim simply replied, yes, so you did, and paid the driver
the director promptly dropped the hand
i just have to look at her—and then there’s the unmannerly way she slams doors, too—i certainly don’t imagine she’s an angel
hans castorp could not help slamming his hand, though with restraint, on the edge of the table
he subscribed to a newspaper call the aryan light, and made speeches, as follows:
oh, by the way, he said, his hand on the doorknob, you’ve made quite an impression on him, tony
here, my hand on it
it seems you have something weighing on your mind, my friend, the senator said in amazement
he paid for their meal
the publisher of his translations of older english literature was located here, after all, which was of some practical value for rudiger; and besides, he had truly missed adrian's company, whom he immediately brought to laughter with the tales of his father and his view
and what do you suppose this tall dragoon says next?—an émigrée, you mean?
for me, and surely for one or two other guests, this exchange had been a quickly erupting duel between rigorous mediocrity and an intellect pained by the depth of experience
the consul spoke earnestly and eagerly
she was indeed well-read and was not accustomed to leading a mute interior life, but to articulating it, and even as a young girl had attempted to write poetry
there were objects of every sort—made of porcelain, nickel, silver and gold, of wood, silk, and linen
it is at your disposal
the strangest thing about him, however, was his eyes: large, extraordinarily keen eyes, so black that they seemed to glow somewhere in bottomless depths, eyes that rested on everything and everyone with a shimmering, enraptured seriousness
hans castorp and peeperkorn were both seated at the narrow end of their respective tables, their backs to the middle of the room, more or less beside one another, with the dutchman a little ahead of hans castorp, making discreet observation easy—and he could also glance across and see frau chauchat in three-quarter profile
slowly she lifted her hands, and those of the two guardians, to her brow, where she let them rest awhile
could there be anything more godforsaken than the purely intellectual?
and get well, by the way
is a man of a more spindled figure, not near so tall as sch, yet shorter than -a sporting cap tugged at one ear, and on the other side reddish hair extending from the temple upward; reddish lashes round likewise reddened eyes, the face pale as a cheese, with the tip of the nose bent slightly askew; a stocking-knit shirt striped crosswise with sleeves too short and fatfingered hands stuck out; trousers that sit untowardly tight, and yellow, overworn shoes ne'er to be clean again
it also opened doors for me, in my role as director, to several aristocratic salons frequented by those same artists
a party to your heart’s desire,
because men want the company of men up here, if you understand me
it sounded like my boshy kock hanna!
though i’m not sure if it’s proper for you to come bearing tales
and johann buddenbrook thanked them all for their gracious words, first as the head of the family and second as the senior partner of the commercial enterprise—and sent thomas back for a third bottle of madeira, because it had turned out his son had been wrong in assuming that two would suffice
she could not get over it
listen here, joachim said, what’s wrong with you?
who knows … she stopped right there, and in her face they saw a beautiful dream collapsing in ruins
i might compare his isolation to an abyss into which the feelings others expressed for him vanished soundlessly without a trace
her answer· was to the effect that this limitation only brought his lovableness closer to her suffering spirit, that without it her spirit would have had no hope, that it had made his fickleness receptive to her own cry of pain
here, too, paths had been shoveled between railed-in, snow-covered mounds—gravesites, each containing a series of regular, properly made beds decorated with stone and metal crosses or little monuments adorned with medallions and inscriptions
how almost unrecognizable his face became when he was alone
and what is closest and most intriguing, most truly my own, is not mere
it would be disgraceful if i were to miss the meeting
she almost burst with laughter as he started on his way, and then she went back into her apartment
i shall attempt to provide as concise an outline as possible of the es-
but poor hans castorp grew even gloomier watching the solitaire players, who could be seen at work everywhere in the berghof at all hours
maria is back to her old self, thank god, she’s been tasting good for several days now
he played with the comparison between the knife-sharp pains that the mute beauty was willing to suffer with every step of her white walking-pins and those that he constantly had to endure, called her his sister in sorrow and presented a kind of intimate and humorously objective critique of her conduct, her willfulness, her sentimental longing for the two-legged world of human beings
it was not too unreasonable to hope that the adversaries were agreed in their intention not to let it come to actual bloodletting
it concludes further that it is the duty of every person who desires to satisfy that natural purpose to cooperate in the cause of human progress
so it’s to be divided
and i have played
a colossal smoked ham, brick-red and strewn with bread crumbs, appeared, along with a brown, tart shallot sauce and mounds of vegetables so large that they all could have filled themselves from just one bowl
how is it possible, really, that she does not understand something so fundamental, so absolute?
and anyone who dared be seen on the street with a walking stick could likewise expect painful indignities to be visited publicly upon him during the next gym class
between nine-thirty and ten, in the middle of the morning, his body temperature was
they listened, mouths open and smiling
the reader is accustomed to such prematurity from me, and he should not interpret it as befuddlement or a lack of literary restraint on my part
surely you like her too, do not you?
he was well past his fifteenth birthday and no longer wore danish sailor outfits, but a tan suit and a blue tie with white polka dots
the phenomenon, as i said, amused me-and then again, it weighed more anxiously on my heart, since the reason behind people's behavior was in fact the atmosphere of indescribable aloofness and solitude that increasingly surrounded him, a distancing that during these years was becoming ever more noticeable and could indeed make one feel as if adrian came from some land where no one else dwells
and thomas buddenbrook turned away in hopeless disappointment from his only son, in whom he had hoped to live on, strong and rejuvenated, and began in haste and fear to seek for truth—which had to exist somewhere for him
i am your most obedient servant, but i will not play it
here and there small boys threw their caps in the air and shouted hurrah!
this local advertiser is a pitiful rag, really
director wulicke’s sudden appearance was a surprise attack, and except for two or three students, no one was prepared
but it’s high time we went off to our rest cure—twenty minutes at most until tea
his reason should have jumped at the chance to assert itself
she could not picture any of the skeptical, claret-drinking, jovial young merchants from their social circle taking his place at the side of her serious and god-fearing daughter, but she could definitely imagine a man of the cloth
it’s the end of september, and travemünde is still operating
what is it i want, castorp?
he collected his hat and cane from the landscape room and promised once again to have his bags brought here at once and to return at four o’clock after taking care of that bit of business
about the person whose guests we just were, settembrini replied, and to whom i introduced you, very much against my will and intentions
hans castorp’s grief and worry did not prevent him from focusing objectively on this phenomenon, and he formulated awkward, but clearheaded observations about it in his conversations with naphta and settembrini, when he would report to them about his cousin’s condition; he was rebuked by the italian, however, for observing that there was an underlying error in the conventional notion that philosophical credulity and sanguine trust in the good are expressions of health, whereas pessimism and condemnation of the world are signs of illness; because otherwise the bleak final state could not bring forth an optimism, compared to whose awful rosiness the preceding gloom seemed a coarse, but healthy expression of life
suddenly they hear the sound of stomping and shuffling in the vestibule downstairs, as if a great many people are crowding into the entrance hall all at once; almost simultaneously a loud, booming voice fills the whole house
but the mere naming of this sum filled tom with a nervous, compelling pride that almost made him look out of sorts
those flashing black eyes, the devil take me if …
i mean, there’s no rhyme or reason to it—they don’t belong together, one is not used to picturing them together
and you are of the opinion that you have none, is that it?
he called out to all sides, keeping his left forearm propped against the tabletop, but raising his right hand and shaking it in the air
but it is far from the case that adrian's monstrous fresco programmatically follows those fifteen illustrations by the man from nuremberg
and so the senator sat staring with weary eyes into the darkness of the salon, and a familiar sense of shame and desperate impatience came over him as he pictured the fallen state of the firm of johann buddenbrook and all its insignificant, small-scale, pennywise transactions
and there’s an end to it!
for anything our reason is tempted to call unjust
the biographical moment for its inclusion has come
and now he said stodgily and peevishly, oh, my dear, i wish we could ignore the whole thing
and hanno pretended that he did
then came the day when the divorce was granted by law and finalized, and tony took care of the last essential formality—asking thomas for the family papers and entering the new fact in her own hand
a good thing it was not sentimental, that would have been rather out of place
she did not occupy herself with any art or science, but instead attached great importance to her daughterly role of managing the household; she read a great deal, however, and wrote extraordinarily well-crafted letters
y’all got things right nice here, herr permaneder said as he sat down, gazing out over the selection of cold delicacies on the table
her stomach would empty its contents and then go on cramping, and the spasms could last for long, torturous minutes
i have already said that by its very nature theology tends-and under certain conditions must always tend-to become demonology
does he still have some money left?
no wonder, then, that the disintegration that came with defeat brought this feeling to its peak, and no wonder, either, that in an overthrown nation like germany it occupied people's minds more than it did those of the victors, whose average emotional state was, as the result of victory, far more conservative
he put together his thoughts about his theory and added them as a foreword to the turtledove
and the thrill was not limited to the person who instigated it
i don’t understand, hans castorp said
oh, he had asked himself that question a thousand times, and responded in one way in his strong and optimistic moments, and in another when he was weary
his youthful listener was sure to have noticed, he said, the difference, or even contradiction, between external and internal freedom—and at the same time the ticklish question as to which form of unfreedom was least or most likely, hee hee, to be compatible with a nation’s honor
she published novels, written under a bizarre pseudonym, in various family magazines
the dry stuff is a mere twenty-five percent of the whole, twenty percent being ordinary egg white, or protein, if you want a little more noble word for it, to which just a little fat and salt is then added
tony, he said, sitting down sideways on his mahogany desk, one leg crossed over the other, and propping his head in his hand
’t’s been an honor, good lady
at any rate, his heart had shrunk beneath those looks—which in his eyes had contradicted and denied, in a most flagrant and intoxicating fashion, the reality that he and the sick woman were not so much as social acquaintances—had, in fact, shrunk almost painfully at the first rattle of the glass door, and his breath had come short and shallow as he sat waiting for that moment
has the club been registered?
you read about this sort of thing in novels, but now here in the flesh was a man in a frock coat, on his knees, begging
i stare into the twilight, fix him with an angry eye
after first offering an explanation for his actions—almost an apology, really, since he felt that was expected—both to her and to her parents, hans castorp now paid his tender respects in a hushed, emotional voice
gerda arnoldsen’s fame spread quickly through the town nonetheless—indeed, she was the main topic of conversation on the exchange, at the club, in the theater, in society in general
they spoke the word lord with the pristine ease of the first christians, who with their own ears had heard the master say, yet a little while and ye shall see me
because you’re an aristocrat yourself
as a favor to me?
in my eyes it is the brightest sword that reason has against the powers of darkness and ugliness
the people in the dining hall had been right, he now discovered, to have taken the interval so lightly
do they think, maybe, that there are no longer any other elegant families in town except them?
hans castorp ate heartily, although with not quite the lively appetite he had expected
she got only as far as the middle of the room—and there was herr grünlich beside her
no, i lack the expertise for that
did i not know the feeling as well, the horror at the intellectual vacuity and nothingness that reigned at the average affair, in garish contrast to the attendant feverish excitement that came from wine, music, and the undercurrent of people interacting
then the judgment spoken against this very berowne, condemning him to spend his wit on speechless, groaning wretches for a year, and his cry: it cannot be, it is impossible
but i’m joint partner, too, who must represent the firm’s interests, and if papa doesn’t think he has any obligation to withdraw moneys from our working capital for a disobedient and rebellious son—we are talking about eleven thousand thalers courant
the gauges sizzled with blue light
propping her elbows on the secretary, she read with growing enthusiasm, with pride and high seriousness
what she gave him was a studied, decorous love, and this much is true: she fulfilled her supportive role with perfect distinction, further refining it with her singular delicate and intricate roguishness of expression
but a cough like that—that’s something new, to me at least—it’s not even human
the trio now walked toward the bottom of the valley to the ice rink, which was not far from the resort and in summer served as a soccer field
but that you can’t get up yet, as you well know, because this silly cough has affected your lungs a bit
you shouldn’t have been so brusque about rejecting medical treatment, at least not the psychological part
herr settembrini then took the floor, and by god, he knew how to make the most of it
with the irresponsible curiosity of the tourist thirsting for knowledge, he had studied that old demon, indeed had found potentialities within himself for lively participation in the monstrous acts of homage paid to it by the world all about him
do let me make a few introductory remarks
over the years, her features had curiously become very like her husband’s
what would we have done without sister leandra when hanno had seizures while he was teething?
he’s sure to find one, and his name will be hermann hagenström—the scoundrel
oh, my dear boy, that’s not the way, the senator cried
hans castorp’s eyes stared wide when he realized who it was, and he could feel the blood drain from his face and his jaw go slack—his mouth was close to dropping open
she repeated herself several times-out of an eagerness to give more suitable expression to what she had said, out of a sense that it had not yet been given its due
paths led up the meadowed hills on their left, but were soon lost to sight in the dull black of pine forests
it wouldn’t be long before they would have to give me a silent sister to keep me from cheating
and when at that same moment the glass door on his left slammed shut with a bang and a rattle, just as it had at first breakfast, he did not flinch as he had earlier that morning, but merely grimaced languidly
the topic came up because of adriatica von mylendonk, because of her name
it was splotched with red, as if he had scarlet fever
one need not be a genius, all one needed was a great deal more talent than the author of this little song about a linden tree to become an enchanter of souls, who would then give the song such vast dimensions that it would subjugate the world
they should just calm down now
oh, you and your learning!
and that is what we recognized betimes and why we have had an eye upon you from early on-we saw that your case was entirely worth our attention, that it was a case of favourable disposition, out of which, presupposing but a little enkindling, incitement, and inebriation, something lustrous might be made
before knowing it, i could only conditionally have called myself a partner in your sorrow's mysteries, as the ode on melancholy puts it at one point-my sole justification being a vague concern i had felt since boyhood for the health of adr,an's soul, rather than any true knowledge of its state
you can window-shop and watch people and buy whatever you need
not even bothering to look at his own room, he had hurried directly to room  to greet his companion from the old days, which were now present days again
it’s not for me alone to decide—i’ll need your consent
there in the dark each was evidently stirred in his own way by a sense of personal and national youthfulness fused into a single emotion
in a certain sense, i think, i would not have done badly at it
and as they sat, here came director behrens walking through the garden
i watched adrian as he conversed with her
she was sitting on the bed opposite her sister-in-law, and suddenly, putting her throaty voice to use, she folded her hands and began to speak the words of a hymn—very loudly
finally it all came to an end
so, then, allow me my detachment
it all lasted barely two weeks, including early tokens of a change in his state of health, even the earliest of which prompted no one-i truly believe, no one-to have the least suspicion of the horror to come
the man of the exact sciences can, of course, become a teacher, but never a pedagogue in the sense and to the degree that the disciple of bonae litterae can
yes, the sleeping bag, hans castorp said, that’s probably a necessary piece of gear
you must admit i’m right there
we often did this, by the way
adieu, my good engineer
mynheer had presided over only one evening of eating and drinking in the previous week, and their walks together had likewise been limited to one abridged stroll
oh, it is merely a matter of christian’s worrying too much about himself, about what is going on inside him
with so much time on his hands, he put comparative morphology to work and made considerable progress in botanical taxonomy
it was quite likely that hermann hagenström, a freethinking and loyal fellow, whom wealth had made cheerful and magnanimous, would have greeted her on the street if he had not felt it strictly forbidden by the way she laid her head back and looked right past him, avoiding his pâté-de-foie-gras face, which, to use her own strong language, she hated like the plague
how genuinely distressed i was, fräulein, to discover i had missed you, he said
but you’re lying, aren’t you?
all the same, it may well be that we do get cynical up here
i myself have spent many daylight hours chatting with him in the abbot's study, when it was kept so dark that only after long adjustment could my eyes distinguish the outlines of the furniture and a pale luster to the walls
i was reading it all during class
i could drink a sip of port to that—just to fortify myself a little
he assured me that he knew our firm’s name quite well, and you can imagine, tom, how pleased i was by the respectful way he said it
dr krokowski had appeared for breakfast and taken the seat opposite him at the head of the table; but, as if in a dream, he barely noticed the fact, although the doctor looked him in the eye, repeatedly and sharply, while carrying on a conversation in russian with the ladies on his right, during which the younger ones—that is, marusya with her rosy complexion and the gaunt yogurt-eater—kept their eyes cast down in meek embarrassment
and quinine will be effective there
the boss’s little speech had come at a critical moment
and so let us bless the fates that have thrown you upon these dreadful shores, giving me the opportunity to influence your educable youth with my not unskilled, not yet totally enfeebled words, and to make you aware of the responsibility that you and your country bear, while the civilized world looks on
it beats not for purely physical reasons, the way fingernails grow on a corpse
a young gentleman with a blond goatee was in charge down here
the lieutenant is a respectable fellow, but his is a simple temperament, not prone to spiritual dangers—the sort that never perturbs a teacher
it pulled the plug on the keg
oh yes, energetic, too, very energetic, hans castorp said
it is demagoguery, blasphemy, and madness!
he might just as easily have asked about whom?
a trim model ship under full sail hung from the middle of the ceiling
for we well know how difficult it is to believe with all one’s soul that sweet jesus is ours alone, for how small are our earthly hearts… three pages later, the consul added his amen, but the pen continued to glide, gently rustling across several more pages, describing the precious fount that quenches the thirst of the weary wanderer, the sacred and bloody wounds of the redeemer, the narrow way and the broad way, and god’s great glory
she looked very pale and shaken; her eyes were red, and her upper lip quivered just as it had when she had cried as a little girl
at these words there was a stir in the audience and someone made to leave
very good, the doctor said
we are taking the same path—’to the right, which leads to the walls of mightiest dis
and then the joy had become reality
we overdid it last night, he said
it may well have been that approaching spring was stirring in their bones and making even sedentary folk restless and eager for change—in any case the number of wild and fraudulent departures from the berghof was increasing to acute levels
i mine the human soul's deep shaft by night, descending boldly down the silent dark, where sorrow's precious ore has left a mark that glistens reticent and yet so bright
there they stood, these gentlemen of accomplishment and wealth, their heads lowered or held mournfully to one side—the legislators among them identifiable by their white gloves and neckties
if it never came to that, it was only because he had to devote a large part of his time to the performance of what he had written, to recitals and singing lessons-and his achievements there were downright extraordinary
it was something for him to jot down for his collection of aphorisms: one either expresses a mystery in the simplest words, or not at all
she represented-should i say, nonetheless ?-the conservative element in the little family, lived in protest against its having been uprooted, against southern germany, this city of artists and bohemianism, against her mother's soirees, and made a point of looking back to the old paternal world of bourgeois dignity and rigor
he’s leaving the day after tomorrow, he told me so, and he can’t possibly stay on if nothing comes of this tomorrow
armgard von schilling talked about the cows at home
the case in my room expired just before i arrived, you said
(i am listing those pieces that are known to me and that are still extant, even if never published)
and at the same time one could be sure that such would also be the case come tomorrow, when, given the favorable probabilities of narrow space and regular schedules, everything would begin all over again
yes, they are barbarians, so to speak—uncivilized, to put a word on it—i did warn you
it was a gramophone
but the idea might also be an expression of something needed by the age, something that might promise a remedy in a time of ravaged conventions and the dissolution of all objective obligations-in short, of a freedom that has begun to coat talent like a mildew and is showing signs of sterility
hans castorp knew this room well, from the days when he had spent some hours chatting here with the psychoanalyst, behind joachim’s back
where are you staying?
indeed, all labor truly deserving of the name is difficult, is it not?
but he was in a very sad state nonetheless
you see me standing here before you, gentlemen, about to say my farewells
and it’s back to göttingen with you tomorrow, do you hear, tomorrow morning!
an ingenious toy, then, on the line of the stereoscopic viewer, the tubelike kaleidoscope, and the cinematographic drum?
as a result, there began to surface certain peculiarities and odd whims, which even he noticed, to his own amazement and revulsion
and let us draw the metaphor out in full, so that we may be just to the rush of his emotions
we have reason to be satisfied
from boyhood on, these were all familiar sights to hans castorp, awakening in him a warm sense of belonging, a feeling that reached its zenith, perhaps, on those occasions when he would join james tienappel or his cousin ziemssen—joachim ziemssen—in the pavilion on the alster for a sunday breakfast of warm rolls and smoked beef, washed down by a glass of old port, then lean back in his chair and puff devotedly on his cigar
nature here exhibited an intermediate state between the free individual existence of simple units and the highly social organization of countless elemental individuals such as tissues and organs within a dominant self—the multicelled organism being only one possible form life might take as it passed through the cyclical process leading from procreation to procreation
he was strengthened by forces close-by
i am saying all this to remind the reader of the historical circumstances under which this account of leverkuhn's life is being written, and to make him realize how the agitated state that is part of my work is constantly being fused beyond recognition with that caused by the convulsions of our day
but the real novelty, the distinctive trait that made him so attractive and conspicuous a personage and singled him out for a leading position in the eyes of many people, was his liberal and tolerant nature
good god, they’re throwing bricks
but what would you?
this was her life
to great applause—and clamoring cheers!
and in conclusion he asked that necessary funds be sent regularly
you will please acknowledge here and now that the opposite is the case
from a distance now, he examined life in his homeland and found that his interlocutor had characterized it correctly
her eyes were moist, her cheeks flushed, and the tip of her tongue played along her upper lip, giving her a look that was part desperation, part mischief
it was adrian who spoke for the most part, while we others seconded him only lightly
suddenly hans castorp recalled that she was also here waiting to be x-rayed
ta ra ta ta!
he wondered if grandmama—or mamselle severin, because grandmama could not shop for everything herself—had found the scenery he needed for fidelio
across the way, st mary’s church lay wrapped in shadows, darkness, and rain
that human hide there is a matter of science
she lunged and stumbled up the stairs more than she climbed them—the hood of her cloak sat wildly askew, her cheeks were flushed, and little beads of sweat had formed on her slightly protruding upper lip
and it was no different in lectures and in the conversations of his fellow students, members of winfried, the christian fraternity that he had joined for appearance' sake and whose guest i was on occasion
joachim laughed heartily, too—it seemed to do him good
you did not go to barcelona against your doctor’s orders
so you’re visiting high-ranking patients, are you?
there was miserable wehsal, whose desire for frau chauchat continued to smolder and who humbly revered peeperkorn and hans castorp, the former for his command of the present, the latter for events in the past
herr settembrini hoped he was not wrong in assuming that hans castorp had made such a remark merely so that it could be contradicted
i don’t wish to offend you, and i admit that you are caught up in an awful mess
well, he did not doubt that the matter could be settled to the satisfaction of all parties concerned
but if he hears the voice of life and shies from it, fearful and reticent, if the memories awakened by its lusty challenge only make him shake his head and stretch out his hand to ward them off, if he flees farther down the path that opens before him now as a route of escape—no, it is clear, he will die
how foolish to object that there was something particularly ignominious about blows administered as corporal punishment
i think so, too!
she sincerely regretted having to think that this change in the situation would also affect i:he messenger and advocate of hopes that could never be realized
i’ll find some use for them again down below—people have blankets everywhere
that was now disputed; hubmeyer and schappeler disputed it, nor was teutleben in agreement, either
no sidewalks, grass growing a foot high between the cobblestones, and houses with bays and stoops and benches jutting out into the streets
i really do have a fair overview from here at the base of my column
it might have seemed surprising that this young italian lad, who spoke only pleasantly broken german and who surely could have found an excellent opportunity at home to train in his specialty, had found his way to adrian's uncle in kaisersaschern; but that was an indication of the commercial ties nikolaus leverkiihn maintained in all directions, not just with german centers of instrument-making like mainz, braunschweig, leipzig, or barmen, but also with foreign firms in london, lyons, bologna, even new york
we all know that there is a great difference between how this splendid song sounds as an art song and as a tune in the mouths of children and everyday folks
sitting up against his pillows, he turned his face toward the wall and drummed his fingertips lightly on his comforter
all the same, joachim discovered him one evening at the usual social gathering in the company of hermine kleefeld, her tablemates gänser and rasmussen, and, as a fifth, the lad with the monocle and saltcellar fingernail; with his eyes glittering undeniably brighter than usual and with emotion in his voice, hans castorp had delivered an extemporaneous oration on frau chauchat’s peculiar and exotic facial features, while his audience exchanged glances, nudged one another, and tittered
you are not going to do it, thomas buddenbrook repeated, almost mad with rage—pale, trembling, his hands jerking
she was wearing a white dress and, what seemed very strange, a wreath of marshy water lilies on her head; holding both hands clasped against one shoulder, her sister had nodded to her
and afterward, when he was alone with his cousin joachim, he expressly let it be known that he found it more than a bit much, indeed absolutely offensive
no one had seen him shed a tear over the death of his father
there was one in particular that hans castorp had known since childhood, for which he now developed a mysterious, multifaceted love and of which we shall speak later
that was not merely a metaphor—any more than it would be a metaphor to call the body of a multicelled creature a city of cells
i understand nothing about it, of course, but its main concern is with human beings
it wants nothing to do with strange flesh
chin up, tony, courage!
meanwhile anton the butler is slicing the towering layer cake and mamselle jungmann is arranging the candies and fresh flowers in silver dessert bowls; and, mustering everything one last time, she lays her head on her shoulder and spreads both pinkies as far as she can
before i forget, he suddenly said rather impulsively, you can go ahead and introduce me to the lady in the garden if we happen to meet her, i have no objections
and if you study with kretzschmar, it will be
i can’t stand it any longer
dearest, i beg you, don’t get overwrought like this
the occupants of the good russian table had withdrawn to a smaller adjoining salon that was set off from the game room by heavy curtains—they formed their own intimate clique
most assuredly not—i wouldn’t think of it!
but i beg your pardon—i climbed a good five thousand feet to join you up here
the old maid said
all the same, he mastered the demands of school with ease-though the word mastered
he asked, baring his teeth, tracing vague designs in the air with his hands, rocking his upper body back and forth
these were colleagues of clarissa's, some fiery young man or other who rolled his r's or young ladies with voices that sat nicely forward; a married couple by the name of knoterich-the husband, konrad knoterich, indigenous to munich and looking a perfect ancient teuton, a sugambrian or ubian or the like (the only thing lacking was the twisted tuft of hair on top), who pursued a vaguely artistic occupation and, though he would actually have preferred to be a painter, was now a dilettante maker of instruments and a cello-player of considerable savagery and inaccuracy, snorting fiercely through his aquiline nose as he played; and his wife, natalia, a brunette who wore earrings and long black curls that dangled down over her cheeks, with an exotic spanish look about her, likewise a painter of some sort
what now follows occurred on a sunday afternoon late in the summer of
but hans castorp, with his eye on his goal and his lungs apparently working superbly, did not let that bother him much
it’s too late to get married tonight
the rooms quickly grow quiet
during the one brief hour after supper—and sometimes that shrank to a mere twenty minutes—when there was some regular social interchange, without exception madame chauchat would take her seat at the back of the little salon, an area reserved apparently for the good russian table, where she was joined by the gentleman with the concave chest, the droll frizzy-haired girl, silent dr blumenkohl, and the two hunch-shouldered youths
after all, never-failing public indoctrination has made sure that we are profoundly aware of the crushing consequences, in all their irrevocable horror, of a german defeat, so that we cannot help fearing it more than anything else in the world
quite true, at least in regard to a given people’s relation to their clergy
and so the week had been devoured, it was sunday afternoon and the distribution of the mail was proceeding as if this were still the sunday of seven days before
it was evident that he did it to savor both his own powers of memory and the words themselves—and to show them off to his audience
the fact that they give their best to pretense deserves all due respect
i suppose you want to go along?
from those godly edifices, our conversation revolved around the person of this, as he is called, unhappy (why unhappy, really?)
in the most common language she makes it quite clear that i have nothing to say to her, that i am not her employer, that i did not hire her, and that she is going to keep the keys until she leaves
an absurd, howling farce?
at least he had a sense of order, and even foolish order is always better than none at all
and the young fellow disappeared
it is written, of course, that they who are neither cold nor hot but lukewarm are to be cursed and spewed out of the mouth
no, he does not like to recall that there was a time when his society was the object
then he moved below the shoulder blade and thumped down the side of the middle and lower ribs; joachim, well trained in all this, now lifted an arm and let him tap just below the armpit
and he made the same face he usually made when listening to music—a rather dull, sleepy, and devout face, his head tilted toward one shoulder, his mouth half-open
i truly felt sorry for the baron
he described the lymphatic vessels, the system of arteries and absorbent tubes; spoke about how breast milk was formed from lymph collected from the legs, abdomen, chest, one arm, and one side of the head; then went on to talk about how at various points in the lymph vessels there were delicate filters called lymph glands, located along the neck, in the armpits, at the crooks of the elbows, the backs of the knees, and similar intimate, sensitive spots on the body
and i enjoyed my time in london, too

peeperkorn offered him a glass of wine from the bottle on the nightstand
a devil of a fellow, our rhadamanthus
there are situations in life on earth, or circumstances of landscape (if one can speak of landscape in this case), in which a confusion and obliteration of temporal and spatial distances, ending in total dizzying monotony, is more or less natural and legitimate, so that immersion into its magic during a vacation, for instance, might likewise be considered legitimate
as it darted about, you could watch its shadow tracing zigzag lines on the striped canvas
and now came little glasses of sabayon to refresh their palates—served with english plum cake
oh, there’s not much pleasure in it, thomas buddenbrook said with a heavy sigh, laying his head back against his chair in disgust
item, one has always had to grow sick and mad, that others need no longer do so
oh, how immensely grateful he felt that he was no longer caught up in uncertainty about himself
joachim had to come along for better or worse
and in doing so, he said, it celebrated its capacity for cosmic metaphor, since those elements were, so to speak, the world's first and simplest building blocks, a parallel that a philosophizing artist of recent memory-and again, it was wagner of whom he spoke-had cleverly put to
godeau had heard and read about the performance of fragments of the apocalypse in prague and inquired about the work
and now here i lie in agony
elly felt guilty somehow, felt she had cheated

and he prayed in his heart that this innocuous and peaceful first class would never end
you’ll all have to come to dinner once a week
dr krokowski walked over to the wall to turn on the chandelier
the only problem was that, in his naïve candor and extraordinary high spirits, he did not pay sufficient attention to what he was saying, and every now and then would tell a story that was somewhat out of place
last but not least, it was apparently this awareness that tempted him to continue to badger me that evening with his investigations or, as he pretended, his experiences in regions monstrously above and beyond us humans, and to go right ahead now and fling himself entire-and me with him- into the ocean of the worlds
there was also the leaf butterfly, whose wings flaunt a triad of vivid color above, but whose underside counterfeits a leaf with bizarre precision, not just in shape and veining, but also by duplicating little impuritiesmimicked water drops, warty fungal growths, and such
there’s something so shameless about that sort of unrestrained talk, tony
hans castorp was neither a genius nor an idiot, and if we refrain from applying the word mediocre to him, we do so for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence and little or nothing to do with his prosaic personality, but rather out of deference to his fate, to which we are inclined to attribute a more general significance
but such was not the case, particularly since his checked trousers had been freshly pressed, so that at first glance you might have thought them new—doubtless the work of his landlord, the young men thought in passing
his captain’s hand trembling slightly, he filled the glasses, with the assistance, offered in respectful bewilderment, of hans castorp
thomas buddenbrook greeted her politely and stepped aside
our daughter is of a marriageable age and has the opportunity of making a match that anyone can see is both advantageous and honorable—and she should do it!
for me, thanks to my friendship with adrian, the artist's life functions as the paradigm for how fate shapes all our lives, as the classic example of how we are deeply moved by what we call becoming, development, destiny-and it probably is so in reality, too
he may have decided to do so as much for the sake of those who lived in the houseand i have one person in particular in mind-as out of pity for the tormented child
but what if the artistic paradox, which says that expression, the expression of lament, is born out of the construct as a whole, corresponds to the religious paradox, which says that out of the profoundest irredeemable despair, if only as the softest of questions, hope may germinate?
he learned pathological anatomy from a volume he was now holding to one side to catch the reddish glow of his table lamp; the text, with a series of illustrations, discussed parasitic cell fusion and infectious tumors
mercury had climbed very robustly, reaching  degrees, almost
and adrian went on,  look at it all from a human point of view

presumably she had not had enough sleep
his presence enhances the dignity of the celebration

together with her daughter, erika, and her granddaughter, elisabeth, she had claimed the most conspicuous position, close to the pastor, right next to the wreaths at the head of the casket; thomas, gerda, christian, klothilde, and little johann, as well as old consul kröger, who sat on a chair, had to content themselves with less prominent places, as if they were more distant relatives
the task before them was to recover the considerable losses that the old man’s death had meant for the firm—the very word was cloaked in a certain divinity
those were the words of la rouchefoucauld—beautiful words, were they not?
and no sooner did she fall silent than the columned hall was filled with harmonious voices singing silent night, holy night, and the family in the landscape room joined in
you’re not seeing the comic side of this—and your bad digestion is to blame for that, of course
it was over now, and that was good—for hans castorp had watched its coming with some uneasiness
the art room was large and well lighted
—you will always find me ready to provide you with an answer, my good engineer, he said with a bow and a deferential downward sweep of his hand, particularly when your objections show some wit
why was he here now?
he looked up, raising one pale eyebrow, and reached a hand out to his sister
denser, von teutleben declared
his favorite turn of phrase was inexhaustibly vacuous!, and no one ever found out if he himself was aware of the joke
and france, the land of cathedrals, whose king was called his most christian majesty, and which produced theologians like bossuet, like pascal?
as for the valley, this winter valley under a deep blanket of snow, to which hans castorp likewise directed his metaphysical questions from his splendid lounge chair, its peaks, summits, ridges, and brown-green-reddish forests stood there silent in time, were draped in the web of silently flowing earthly days, now sparkling against the deep blue of the sky, now wrapped in mists, now aglow with the red of the setting sun, now glittering hard as diamonds in a world turned magical by moonlight—but always in the snow, while six unbelievably long months had scampered by
you speak of morality—but what do you mean by morality in art?
he stood leaning against the wall, contributing a comment to the conversation now and then, but for the most part gazing silently and vacantly out over the banister
grobleben is a worker in one of the consul’s warehouses, and he is allowed to earn a little extra on the side by polishing his employer’s boots
calculations from behind a desk don’t lead to success
as he eased himself into it, thomas buddenbrook briefly explained his problem, laid his head back, and closed his eyes
i don’t know who ought to like that more—settembrini with his bourgeois world republic, or naphta with his hierarchical cosmopolitanism
and then the senator escorted both guests out through the dining room
it was six o’clock when the consul came upstairs
they played a movement of haydn, a few pages of mozart, a beethoven sonata
broken s r e
marusya, after all, with her little orange-scented handkerchief, sat down at the same table with them five times a day
i’m certain bed rest will soon take care of it
might i be permitted a question: how old are you really?
i want the signal
by suppertime on the twenty-fourth, the tree had been gaily decorated with tinsel, glass balls, gilt cones, little apples in nets, and all sorts of candies; its colorful wax candles burned during the whole meal and for a while afterward
and how could i?
but i don’t think i’ll wait for them
they were furnished with beds and chests in the style of the painted hutch in the formal hall, but only a few of them had bedclothes, puffy featherbeds towered high in rustic fashion
the young man needed only to look at toxicology
johann buddenbrook worked his way about the room, greeting first his old friend c f köppen, and then the latter’s competitor, consul kistenmaker
yes, it was different in the old days
and how very near midsummer night already was, especially with pentecost just around the corner; and once the longest day had come and gone, the year raced downhill from there, toward winter—so that in a way the great-aunt and marusya were as good as back again
i was willing to take that risk because it has long been my wish that clarity should be established between us—between me and the man for whom i entertain such extraordinary respect
grandfather said he could make oxen give milk, those were his very words
if he was sitting with the rest of the family, he was mute and seemed distracted, and if he happened to set little clara on his knee, perhaps to sing her some old funny songs—let’s ride through town on the omnibus or looka that horsefly on the wall, for instance—he might suddenly fall silent, set his granddaughter back on the floor, and turn away, as if caught up in some long, half-unconscious train of thought, which ended then in curious!
lemon buns with breast of goose—that really must taste good, she thought
after dinner i had her introduce me to herr arnoldsen senior, who responded with special politeness
he wished he had already reached his goal, because once you were up there, he thought, you lived just as people did everywhere, instead of having the climb constantly remind you of how unsuitable these precincts were
towering behind him were huge columns, piled cylindrical blocks with no bases and with moss growing in the joints—the columns of a temple gate, and he was sitting on the open stairway that led to it
frau permaneder cried and, jerking her head back, she stared fiercely into her mother’s face with tear-stained eyes, before suddenly dropping her head back into the folds of elisabeth’s skirt
our paths were parting in any case
to judge from what one hears, still further masquerades await us
i shall preface his answer simply by saying that its antiquated prose is, of course, intended as a parody, an allusion to his own quaint experiences in halle and to the linguistic deportment of ehrenfried kumpf-at the same time, however, it also expresses his personality; it is a selfstylization, a manifestation of his inner disposition and of a highly characteristic tendency to hide behind and find fulfillment in parody
i want hot tea!
but then, suddenly one of the two sentries heard a short, discreet hissing sound from inside the building, and at almost the same moment he saw the flash of a red coat—bailiff uhlefeldt, with his three-cornered hat and ceremonial sword, emerged, bustling with high officiousness, uttered a soft attention!, and hastily withdrew again, as approaching footsteps echoed across the tile floor inside
you’ve put it perfectly, dotted the i and crossed the t, herr settembrini
the spring in his step, the enterprising swing in his stride as he walked along in his frock coat, fists balanced in front of him, eyes roving, the enormous vigor with which he asked questions and told anecdotes from the heights of unschooled ignorance—it was all gone now
frau stöhr was in a state of terrible upset for several days because of a sum of money—ten francs—that she had been foolish enough to lend frau iltis to contribute, but which that lady had forgotten to repay
so that such persuasion on his part, which he had used with her, too, and might probably use with me as well, had been cheapened forever
the moment he entered the room, he had spotted the theater that his eyes were seeking so feverishly—there on the table, a splendid theater, looking much larger and grander than he had even dared imagine

in my own mind, at least, i never addressed clavdia except by that name and with informal pronouns—or indeed in reality, either
you’ll discover that the crab form has been used by the greatest composers down through the centuries

we offer better still, we offer foremostly the right and true-a thing no longer even classic, dear boy, which we let be experienced, a thing archaic, primal, a thing that has long since ceased to be attempted
that’s what we all call her at least, because those are the only words you ever hear out of her
his chin and upper lip were clean-shaven, but, following the english fashion, he had long side-whiskers—of a striking tawny, golden color
how nice, elisabeth said, smoothing things over; and that took care of that subject
good lord, what’s wrong with him, ida?
he did so with overwhelming success
the result was that his scholarship was transferred from the second tier, with its more modest board and room, to the first tier, where meals were served by waiters, and the neighbors on each side of his cubicle were a silesian count von harbuval and chamaré and a marquis di rangoni-santacroce from modena
we want freedom of the press, of employment, of commerce
but as things now stood, one could speak of expansion, but not of any sort of achieved expanded state, whether finite or infinite
don’t say anything about it!
there was senator thomas buddenbrook, whose alert, spirited, even humorous expression was contradicted by the pallor of his face; his wife, gerda, leaning back in her armchair, immobile, her lovely white face turned upward, her close-set, blue-shadowed eyes glistening strangely under the spell of the flickering light of the chandelier’s crystal prisms; his sister, frau permaneder; his cousin jürgen kröger, the quiet, neatly dressed civil servant; his cousins friederike, henriette, and pfiffi, the first two looking skinnier and taller than ever, the latter shorter and plumper, but all three with faces set in one standard expression—a caustic, malevolent smile disparagingly directed at all persons and things, as if they had but one constant, skeptical question: really?
godeau chatted with adrian, responding to his inquiries about her career in paris, about recent works of french ballet and opera, with only some of which he was familiar-the creations of poulenc, auric, rieti
and with his advent a new spirit entered the old school
she opened a few of the cables: from relatives in hamburg and frankfurt, from herr arnoldsen and his family in amsterdam, from jürgen kröger in wismar
i’ll watch for now, he exclaimed, brushing the fine drops of rain from his tailcoat
i believed in his pride, of which i for my part was also proud, and had no real doubt that pride had been the source of his decision
the gambling was obviously of secondary importance to him
although he would have said, certainly, mademoiselle, rather unpleasant, and perhaps have pulled his handkerchief from his breast pocket with a little flourish and blown his nose
what a contrast between the slack anguish on his face and the elegant, almost martial care he gave to how it looked—to his perfumed mustache, drawn out to long, stiff points, to his fastidiously clean-shaven cheeks and chin, to the meticulous cut of his hair and the way he made sure that the first hint of baldness on the crown was well hidden, to the two long waves that fell back from his delicate temples, to the carefully combed narrow part, to the very cropped trim above the ears that he had adopted of late in place of his old full curls, so that people could not see that his hair was graying there
something else contributed to the confusion of clarissa's life
the rain did not let up
he wears black to indicate that his particular specialty is the night
you’re not yet familiar with it, but it reproduces every note of a theme from back to front
is that not a bewitching name?
it would be less than precise to say that he was ashamed for frau chauchat; rather, he felt personally ashamed in front of all these people
you are, if i may put it that way, one of life’s problem children, a fellow whom others must look after
their settlements were two in number: one named ephrata, in lancaster county; the other, in franklin county, called snowhill; and all of them had respectfully looked up to their leader, shepherd, spiritual father-to a man named beissel, the founder of the sect, in whose character intense devotion to god was united with the qualities of a pastor of souls and master of men, and fanatic religiosity with gruff energy
that’s correct, perlemann, herr ballerstedt interrupted him, touched by so much timid subservience, and jotted a good grade in his book
i wonder if she’ll say the same thing to me when i get to know her?
i have already expressed my regret that my hurried eagerness must here and there leave the impression of thoughts in headlong flight
both times, he shook his head and after a moment of silence said softly but firmly, no one is allowed in
to the community was debatable, if for no other reason than the community's failure to appear, which, however, could in part be traced, as noted, to the all too specific nature of the topics treated
you think too highly of my flexibility, he rejoined-and had baptist spengler's bleating laughter to second him
dr ting-fu suggested with a giggle that mr holger was apparently rather vain
a pale blond, sparse mustache that hung like fringe over his mouth, a perfectly round head, a stump of a nose, and thinning, badly cut hair combined to make him look somewhat like a walrus
as things stood, she probably did have to, i realize that, we all had to realize it
and seeing her son so downcast, she appeared close to tears herself and was grateful to her nephew for his attempts to revive his despondent cousin’s spirits
path around a sphere-which, of course, leads around or back around it-can be termed regressive
he was trying with his shoulder to push settembrini off balance, as he stood there smiling that refined, dry, ironic smile, just below where his full moustache swept handsomely upward—and it was the smile that offended hans castorp
there are so many things to consider
his tongue was contentedly wandering among his teeth, causing his dignified mouth to assume the most extraordinary positions
i would that schildknapp might return that i could laugh with him
pastor pringsheim began to speak, and his elegant voice filled the whole house with sonorous, well-modulated tones
old senator möllendorpf presided—a pallid, diabetic gentleman with sparse white whiskers that ended in two points
her daughter’s future had been a worry for years now, because, compared with other marriageable young ladies, erika was definitely at a disadvantage
even hans castorp kept a glass plate framed in cardboard, which, when held up to the light, showed him standing in a garish green woodland meadow, between frau stöhr and fräulein levi of the ivory complexion, the former in a sky-blue sweater, the latter in a blood-red one, his own face coppery against a field of pale yellow buttercups, one of which glowed in his buttonhole
time had swept onward, bringing forth more than one change
and yet he was one of them, because he managed his small, respectable brokerage business in the best, modest middle-class fashion
what a dilemma for our human emotions—and so sad that i can’t even begin to express it
joachim, being an old hand at this, had moved back toward the exit door to take up a position at an adjustable frame
the valley would long since have filled with shadows, and while hans castorp ate, it would grow discernibly darker in the white room
the others were busy with ellen brand, whose pose had not changed—she was still sitting in her chair, staring vacantly ahead, a strangely affected expression on her face
the word twiddle-twaddle sounded ghastly and bizarre when she spoke it, with her lower lip shoveling away
and fräulein kleefeld had just whistled hello to me with her pneumothorax, and i was a little taken aback
nothing awful had happened yet, thank god, and nothing awful needed to happen, it was even unlikely it would
you are offered the chance to do a good deed and at the same time to make the best business deal of your life, and …
no doubt just as the animal kingdom consisted of various species of animals, just as the organism of the human animal consisted of a whole animal kingdom of cell species, so, too, the cell consisted of a new and diverse animal kingdom of elemental, submicroscopic living entities that grew independently, multiplied independently according to the law that each can only produce its own kind, and cooperated by division of labor to serve the next higher level of life
but two days later, when he had the pension gisella's housemaid announce him to the aunt, he was not turned away

aviators, pilots, he said, were mostly very nasty, untrustworthy sorts, and were above all very superstitious
dr mantelsack, however, went on with the lesson
thomas buddenbrook spoke of the central location and the unusually large lot; but, contorting his lips and hissing in a savage, choked voice, herr gosch now gave him a little lecture, punctuated by horrible gesticulations, about the crushing risk he would be taking—an explanation so trenchant and vivid that it was almost a poem
i can never have a little fun without paying for it
the englishwoman with the rose-hip tea was named miss robinson

little johann sat between his parents and managed to force down a piece of white meat and some dressing

but, to his father’s annoyance, hanno reacted to these healthy exercises with aversion—silent, aloof, almost arrogant aversion
the majority were not happy
they sat together in the large playroom on the third floor and did their homework
and he looked her unexpected companion directly in the eye, not without a defiant toss of his head to mock the masklike face and the grandeur of the figure, not without challenging his own heart to make fun of this exalted personage, whose current rights of possession were cast in a very odd light by certain past events: certain past events, indeed—not dark, uncertain events from the realms of amateur portraits, which had had the power to disquiet him at one time
was it necessary to make a trip all the way from munich, with little erika—which to people less sensible than we might almost appear to mean that you never intend to return to your husband again?
until the third week, until the decisive crisis, the question of either-or hovers in the air, and he cannot possibly tell whether in this case the disease he calls typhus is an inconsequential mishap, the result of an infection that might perhaps have been avoided and that can be combated with the resources of science—or if it is quite simply a mode of dissolution, the garment in which death has clad itself, though it could just as easily have chosen some other disguise, and for which there is no known remedy
he then asked the pianist, a weary-eyed young fellow who had surely dreamt of higher things than his present employment, whether he knew the accompaniment to dvorak's humoresque, and even on this mediocre fiddle he played that delightful piece with all its numerous grace notes, charming slides, and smart double stops so jauntily and brilliantly that he won loud applause from everyone in the inn-from us, from the nearby tables and dumbfounded musicians, even from the two waiters
adrian saw all this, wandered amid it, sampled it during the nine months of his first stay in upper bavaria-an autumn, a winter, a spring
she’s gone to the apothecary, frau permaneder said
he climbed into the fly beside his father and then sat mutely at his side in various parlors, watching with quiet eyes the easy, tactful, and yet so varied and carefully measured way his father dealt with these people
but oblivion would not come
they prayed only for the mercy of a gentle passing
goblet in hand, bareheaded, the collar of his wrinkled, almost floor-length overcoat turned up, his idol-like creased brow encircled by flames of white hair—there he stood beside a boulder, and his face grew more animated as he held the ring of thumb and forefinger up to it, finger lances jutting into the air, and lectured, punctuating his vague, inaudible toast with the spellbinding token of precision
as always with love,
the dermatologist's two waiting rooms, with one reserved for female patients, were decorated with potted plants-palms and african hemp
that is, of course, no word for it, mynheer peeperkorn, said hans castorp, who had some difficulty downing the whole glass in one draft, and now took out his handkerchief to wipe the wine he had spilled on his knee
what lies below is still as nothing in comparison with the quantity above-we give time, abundant, immeasurable time, the end of which one need not contemplate, not for a long while, nor even yet have cause to be fretted with that point in time when one might begin to think on the end, when  arespice finem' might pertain, inasmuch as it is an unsteady point in time, subject to vagaries and temper, and no man knows where it ought be set and at how far a distance from the end
that touch had come as a profound shock, an experience of depths of which he had never thought the world capable, and, if i see it all correctly, an experience that contributed not a little to making him a recluse in the world
my conscience-and i use the word here in a more-thanpersonal sense-was not quite pure
she feels the tears welling up inside her
he heard another cold, deep voice reply: i’ve been watching him for some time now
that was a bit of royal foolishness
and for one man's raptures to be ancillary borrowings modeled on the raptures of another
as strange as it may sound in light of our long years of comradeship, the subject of love, of sexuality, of the flesh had never been touched upon in our conversations in any personal or intimate fashion; the matter had entered into our exchanges always and only through the medium of art and literature, occasioned by manifestations of passion in the intellectual sphere that prompted remarks from him that were matter-of-factly knowledgeable but in which his own person played no role
every lady in town said, either to elisabeth buddenbrook or to her daughter: what a treasure your mamselle jungmann is, my dear
yes, indeed—but i can’t stay here

but tell me now, my good engineer, he said, how has your family taken the news?
i’m much obliged to you for your reminder and warning
and besides, it would be quite counter to reason—no, you must admit
they stared at the ostentatious funerary display, at first in amazement and then with increasing boredom; they fidgeted with their caps in their hands, until one of them found the courage to depart, and then the whole troop shuffled out behind him
a conservatory, neither the great one nor the hasean, where he instructs; 'twould be, he says, no climate for me, but rather i should do as did papa haydn, who had no preceptor anywhere, but rather procured for himself the gradus ad parnassum by fux and other sundry music of the day, most particularly that of bach of hamburg, and doughtily perfected his craft therefrom
and indeed it came to pass that he himself heard her lips form the mournful phrase that had become her nickname
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee
go fetch your rescuer some ice cream and ask her for the next waltz

no, no, she repeated, so touched that she bent down to him, i don’t despise you, herr grünlich
but he did not let anyone notice, and no gesture carried any intimation that all this had, or would ever have, anything to do
by the way, none of them owned pistols
the corners of thomas’s mouth were drawn down, lending him an almost contemptuous look
we repeat, he recalled all this and realized not only that it would have been difficult not to betray oneself under such circumstances, but also that the attempt would hardly have been worthwhile
he lay there for a long time feeling queasy, excited, weary, anxious, and happy, and could not fall asleep
it’s just strange to hear it, hans castorp said
i’ll tell you something—just before i came here to see you, i was seriously considering going to cremer and throwing myself on him, begging him to intervene, to get involved in this
they’re all simply too short
he was said to be very religious, which, as might be expected, was not uncommon among the people up here, or so hans castorp had been told
frau salomon from amsterdam might sit on the balustrade—hard-pressed on one side by the knees of thick-lipped gänser and on the other by the swedish bruiser, who, although completely well now, had extended his stay for a little extra therapy
is that any comfort?
i had to toss it away, there was no point in forcing it
the chin was too small
that was joachim’s advice; and official channels worked
a new rumor emerging from somewhere has run in a zigzag all the way to her
it would have been monstrous to express alarm at the boy’s childish awkwardness
serenus, she said, it is inevitable, i know it
might i inquire if you intend to bring these scurrilities to a close soon?
wendell kretzschmar subscribed to the principle-one we repeatedly heard from lips first shaped around the english language-that it was not a matter of other people's interest, but of his own, and thus of exciting their interest, which could only happen, indeed was guaranteed to happen, if one had a fundamental interest in the subject oneself and so, when speaking of it, could not help involving others in that interest, infecting them with it, thereby creating an interest never extant, never even suspected before-all of which was worth a great deal more than catering to one that already existed
we shall see them again, friederike buddenbrook said, folding her hands firmly in her lap; she lowered her eyes and thrust her nose in the air
they began to tease him, laying heads to one side, winking, and putting fingers up to their ears, as if these were racy, risqué revelations about someone who had played the innocent until now
his wife nodded with some hesitation; her embroidery still lay in her lap
but as for his dignified nurse, madame decho, who had cared for him until now, the decision had been made that it would not be she who would move into the new house, but that ida jungmann would replace her and that elisabeth would have to look for other help
everyone, however, received the affidavits, even people quite removed from the matter
i do not assume so; rather, i believe that if there was some defect, it was psychological, disposing her to show forbearance and consideration wherever it was required
i’m in my early thirties now, but i’m not yet so old that my dearest friends should be the last himmelsbürger or the ladies gerhardt or one of mother’s men in black who devour widows’ houses
but now as the young man grew more confused, the older man gradually began to rear up out of his chair, taller and taller, to full size—his majestic head swelling and turning red, the arabesques on his brow rising and spreading, his little eyes growing ever larger in pale threat
majoresku, and several others, for whom not the last reason for attending was, to be sure, to see the future bridegroom, rudi schwerdtfeger, at his music stand up front on the left
my respects, for that
my good engineer, he said in a choked voice, my good engineer
what, not a one?
even then, however, he towered over herr lodovico and was several heads taller than little naphta; but that was not the only reason why his presence weighed so heavily—so overwhelmingly heavily, just as hans castorp had pictured it in his imagination—on the existence of the two political theorists
but now my brain is so numb that i could be struck by lightning and not bat an eyelash
would not that be lovely, they suggested, if only old age were permitted to judge youth, leaving it forever the object of outside observation, as if it had no share in objective thought
but the song’s best son may yet have been the young man who consumed his life in triumphing over himself and died, a new word on his lips, the word of love, which he did not yet know how to speak
during the break between classes, he monitored the corridor and was also responsible for order in the classrooms
(though god only knew how he had managed to be witty—with apparently not a drop of blood left in his head)
people said that behrens, who idolized her, had been so overwhelmed by the blow that he had temporarily fallen into a strange melancholy and had been seen walking the streets giggling, gesticulating, and talking to himself

i don’t want to be famous
it was at this same time, by the way, that his inherited migraine began to give him bad days
various boys were called upon to show what they knew about job, the man from the land of uz; and gottlieb kassbaum, the son of the unfortunate wholesaler herr kassbaum, was given an excellent grade despite his family’s shattered circumstances, because he was able to state definitely that job’s substance consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred asses, and a very great household
then you can’t imagine what an annoyance, what a disappointment that is for someone like myself, who has smoked with such gusto from youth on
it would mean the constellation has renewed what was worn-out
why, you don’t suppose she provoked him a little, just to test him?
frau permaneder had run out of objections to gerda’s decision
i can stand here all night if need be, he thought
oh, it was pointless to get up now and work—there was too much to do, there was something to learn for almost every class, it wasn’t worth trying to start now, and the time he had set for getting up had passed anyway
that does not prevent his nails and hair from growing, or that all in all—but we shall not repeat the slang idiom that joachim once used in this same context and that at the time offended hans castorp’s flatland sensitivities
a voice in the tiny audience cried, for the speaker could not manage the final word, which he had used so frequently till now, and was still stuck mumbling its initial consonant
instead, the remarkable and profoundly significant thing was that although humankind was a sexual creature in two different forms, and although it was more appropriate to localize the demonic in the loins of the male than the female, nonetheless the whole curse of the flesh and the enslavement to sexuality had been laid upon the female, until it had come to proverbs like: as a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair
what was all this he had himself believing?
what a damn sly person little tony was!
rumor had it that she had entered a tuberculosis sanatorium as a very young girl and had never lived in the outside world since
and at this moment there doesn’t seem to be anyone on her side
it’s still in the family papers
and although this harmless vice added a jaunty touch to his appearance, the ultimate effect was much more that of the license of old age, the kind of carelessness that age either consciously and merrily permits itself or brings with it, cloaked in dignified oblivion; in any case, it was the only such carelessness in his grandfather’s appearance that little hans castorp’s sharp eye ever observed
if only he could take hanno’s education in hand himself, he could then mold his mind, every hour of every day
it came, swept over him, and he no longer fought it
yes, morten said, let’s take a seat
perhaps it had escaped from a magic forest or from one of the grimm’s fairy tales that ida read to him at home
but of course, to be sure, james tienappel concurred, somewhat intimidated by his foster brother, who spoke so calmly and in a monotone; the crisp autumn evening was close to freezing, yet there beside him sat hans castorp without hat or overcoat
only mamselle jungmann was already up, making coffee for breakfast
it’s not clear when or if he will be allowed to leave here
it goes without saying that adrian shared in the raptures of my humanist's heart with only a nod and a smile that was not without irony
on tuesday or wednesday, however, he would depart, and leave joachim behind alone, poor joachim, for whom rhadamanthus had decreed who-knew-how-many more months and whose gentle black eyes dimmed with melancholy every time hans castorp made a passing reference to his approaching departure
no, that’s not what i wanted to ask
to offer no reply
true, with time she had ceased making the pale man dance or visiting the doll lady; but she had a way of tossing her head that was getting saucier and saucier, and she exhibited, especially after spending a summer in the country with her grandparents, a serious proclivity to be vain and haughty
the prince’s scandalous behavior was still the talk of the valley, but rhadamanthus had simply winked an eye, both eyes—every inch a hofrat
to be sure, his eldest daughter’s dowry had been forfeited, and the losses the firm had suffered in that bankruptcy in bremen in  had been a heavy blow
and then they’ll be accepted at last
only one person talked like that, one bothersome person
it was incredible that, although poor klothilde partook daily of large quantities of strong nourishment, it was all to no avail
and so, he declared, pieter peeperkorn will now regale himself with a schnapps
he said nothing more, just grabbed a roll and, without sitting down, his hat still on his head and his satchel under one arm, began to drink his cocoa
possibly not, the consul said, mulling it over and without addressing anyone in particular
o salute, o satana, o ribellione, o forza vindice della ragione’
there is no stopping it: surrender on all sides, everyone scattering
now good rudi was no hero of self-mastery and had never done anything in his life that had not come easily to him-as for example, and above all, his excellent violin playing
and joachim would have been amazed at his easygoing manner—presumably, however, without seriously wanting to have changed places with him
ways found rather oppressive-between the arena of adrian's childhood and the framework of his later life
i’m getting blepharospasmosis from all the winking i do
they realized that it was lodovico settembrini at the side of a stranger, but it appeared that he did not recognize them or at least did not want to encounter them, because he quickly turned his head away and dived back into the conversation with his companion, gesticulating and at the same time trying to move quickly on ahead of them
but what about you?
partenkirchen, about an hour from munich, and the next station, pfeiffering or pfeffering, is only ten minutes farther, although express trains do not stop there
his head felt hot, and a strange pressure, a disquieting tension had built up inside it, as if something were about to burst
the sta�e of war, for which the highest authority was transferred from civilians to the military, to a general who issued proclamations, was greeted with a cozy shudder
october—that’s when it will be
this will allow him to make up for many a setback and show people that good luck hasn’t quite deserted the firm of johann buddenbrook yet
it was an ordinary hour, neither long nor short
take my volubility as an expression of the fact that i have abandoned the plan that brought me here!
the process has not been totally explained, since so far we have been unable to locate dilating muscles along the blood vessels that are activated by the vasomotor nerves
actually you have heard it already
by which you probably mean a love that has been deprived of its animal warmth, is that it?
although they tell me that you are musical and play the piano, is that right?
appearances were deceiving, but he looked exactly like someone democrats would not be able to count on, and the resemblance to his grandfather was undeniable
your very humble servant, say i i ought to know you thus, and i find it courteous of you to read me a private lecture here in my hall
she had been a very charming woman, if a little cross-eyed and gaunt, to judge from photos you found scattered about the director’s official residence, not to mention oil portraits of her that were hung on the walls—painted by his own amateur hand
there was none of the confusion and provocation of spring down on the plains—no seething in the depths, no damp odors, no sultry vapors
the consul watched her in bewilderment
when accompanying a lady shopping, he might very well point to an object and say, well, i would not actually spend money on it
our army, under hausen, lay south of chalons-sur-marne and was poised for the march on paris, as was kluck's army at another position
but joachim was obviously unaware of any possible insult in his explanation, and now inquired about the residents of the berghof and the latest news—not only without any arrogance, but indeed with the insistent animation of the traveler come home
his protest against the egotism prevalent here was only one of them
but rudolf made it difficult for you to perceive his value and to keep
that is adrian leverkiihn in his entirety
then allow me to avail myself of— he spilled a little wine as he poured himself another glass
wet grass sprouted up between the cracked cobblestones
his petition was refused!
what do you say to that?
letting oneself go, in fact, was doubtless a definition of madness in many cases, inasmuch as it was a way of fleeing from great affliction and served weak natures as a defense against the overpowering blows of fate, which such people felt they could not withstand in their right mind
he had rejected the proposal with all the determination he could put into his voice
god will punish them one day, i firmly believe that!
he did not go to bed, however
the school clock was a little slow, but he would be late all the same, that was certain
myself whether the reader's patience is holding out
now he’s grabbing my wrist, he thought
the two brothers glared eye to eye now across the table
whose details can be of interest to no one
but i must ask one thing of you, my friend
’nd a good day to you, madame grünlich, the harbor pilot said, so delighted he went right on speaking plattdeutsch
because it’s not a matter of a brilliant match this time, but solely of patching over the past as best we can with a second marriage
these schwarzkopfs were marvelous people
i have always feared adrian's penchant for laughter, which, unlike rudiger schildknapp, i was always poor at encouraging-and i feel that same fear, that same timid and anxious helplessness when listening to this sardonic gaudium of gehenna as it sweeps across fifty bars, beginning with the giggle of a single voice, only to spread rapidly and seize choir and orchestra, then, amid rhythmic upheavals and counterblows and jettisons, to swell to a horrible fortissimo tutti, to a dreadful mayhem of yowls, yelps, screeches, bleats, bellows, howls, and whinnies, to the mocking, triumphant laughter of hell
needless to say, you shall destroy this at once
the metal casket was hermetically sealed and covered with flowers, the candles were lit, and the house filled up with people
less than fifteen minutes now …
oh, you have no idea what bad shape i’m in
and as you heard i’m all in favor of that, of celebrating things as they come, just as the calendar dictates
those were extremely tenacious, important seconds—they stretched out into a little eternity, leaving extraordinarily dense deposits in the scurrying shadow of grand time
everywhere the hour-glass has been turned and time has been given, incomprehensible, but bounded time and an appointed end, there are we upon the field, there grows our sweet clover
that night, while the frau senator sat in profound grief beside the rigid remains of her child, we three-adrian, frau schweigestill, and
he said things—you know the things i mean—about modern communism and the godly zeal of the proletariat that cannot refrain from shedding blood
she was ready to pay anything for this delicacy
how utterly ridiculous it all is
at last peeperkorn said softly: you were clavdia’s lover during her previous stay here
the ladies had not been following the discussion for some time
i was talking with fräulein wasserklosett; actually her name was miss waterhouse, a very pretty girl
and where did the soul go until then?
what a puny, disgustin’ cuss!
we have told it to its end; it was neither short on diversion nor long on boredom—it was a hermetic story
and thank god, he had shown sufficient feverish presence of mind to reply, pas de quai, madame!
grandson settembrini mentioned one detail that made a special impression on young hans castorp: grandfather giuseppe had worn only black when appearing among his fellow citizens, because, as he said, he was in mourning for italy, his fatherland, which languished in misery and bondage
i must ask you something, ask you something very urgent, but in german
they have been sent to me from lugano, where the league has a branch office
hans castorp went on
as if they called to me—
and although one may tend and nurse illness in the individual case, to honor it intellectually is an aberration—imprint that on your minds!—an aberration and the beginning of all intellectual aberrations
hans castorp himself had the impression that checkups, quite apart from the results, were a source of entertainment for the ladies, for which they attired themselves in their flirtatious best
you have no idea how that torments me, do you, father?
old scratch himself atop them all, settembrini explained softly, gesturing toward the director—and then was dragged away from hans castorp’s side
the pride and joy on her face and in her movements became a kind of grave solemnity whenever she led visiting relatives through her new home—making erika weinschenk look like another admiring guest in her own house
where might i be, if i were not here?
but, rather, her melancholy, which sought out misfortune, fixed on the man whom to her disgust she had heard say: there are lots of unhappy women already!

but why does she keep saying man alive,  as if she were addressing me?
this charge was leveled against the fusion of oldest and newest elements that is so characteristic of the work, but is in no way arbitrary, since it lies, rather, in the nature of things-by which i mean, that it is based on the curvature of the world, which allows the earliest things to come round again in what is most recent
so i hear, herr grünlich said with grim certainly
it fell to rudiger to set us laughing about it, although he did acknowledge my rather emotion-laden remarks; by parodying that ponderous thinker and his draping of a cloak of moral tropes over a long-standing strategy, he transformed all those brutal sentiments, solemn regrets, and respectable atrocities into something irresistibly comic-and made something even more comical of them than of the virtuous roar of a stunned world, which had in fact
yes, i am quite taken by munich
naphta sat silent, his eyes sparkling, a caustic look on his face
yet the manner in which you are treating me at present cries out to heaven, and, should you entertain the idea that in light of your silence i shall be content to remain silent myself, you are sadly mistaken

a man with a red beard and a brown long-tailed coat came in
the great scholastics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were unanimous in their conviction that nothing could be true in philosophy that was theologically false
as for me, i call lublin my place of birth-yet another worthy town gray with age, from which one carries a wealth of severite into life, un hat d'ame solennel et un peu gauche
i must reproach myself for being tactless, because at such words i automatically glanced adrian's way to read his expression-tactless, that is, because of the discomfort in his response, the annoyance he showed in blushing and turning aside
yes, i’ve always taken a great deal of interest in it
he has feathered legs and a beak of iron, an iron hook at the very tip, and talons of horrendous power, claws that turn inward, one long rear claw that forms an iron vise with those at the front
he had begun love's labour's lost, the piano sketch of its expository scenes was complete, but then work came to a standstill
johann buddenbrook wants to pipe on his flute, and i simply have to wait for that

she softly stroked the short-cropped hair at the back of his head with one hand
i really don’t believe it’s good for him to take everything to heart so
and on the other hand, his love was something utterly elusive and amorphous, a thought—no, a dream, the terrifying and infinitely seductive dream of a young man whose answer to certain, though subconsciously posed questions would have been only hollow silence
it was holger in person, the spirit named holger, the one who had known about the pinch of salt and all the rest, but who, of course, never got mixed up in any questions at school
had she known that he had made an appointment for an examination at two o’clock?
dressed in greatcoats and with weapons on their shoulders, two sentries paced the designated distance, striding resolutely through the filthy slush under their feet
behrens called, with a strong emphasis on the first word
the needle struck home
do you want to retain the capitalist system, deutschlin, arzt asked, because it keeps alive the memory of the perils of human life?
he simply won’t give in, the lad won’t
humankind must be informed that certain effects can be diminished only when one first recognizes their causes and negates them, and that almost all sufferings of the individual are illnesses of the social organism
so this had been the effect of her father’s discreet letter, which was meant to postpone any decision indefinitely
after all, we are here to talk business
i say thank god,  because it really is a reason to praise god
the science of religion, then, has nothing to do with philosophical theses, but with a psychological fact, a given within man
hans castorp only surmised all this, however, more than he actually saw it—she was really too far away
shhh, ida said, yes, he’s asleep
south of be noted
you don’t feel the cold that much, because the air is so dry and the wind is still
yes, what was the source of my distrust of
there, i have rhymed it all together, dreamed a poem of humankind
at the start of the new season, then, clarissa met this young man, who promised to rescue her from her failed career and in its place offered, as her husband, a peacefully secure, indeed well-situated existence in a world that was, granted, foreign to her, but not unlike that of her bourgeois origins
one girl, her hair wound in a knot, but with a few, especially charming stray strands at the back of her neck, sat with her feet dangling in a little dell and played a shepherd’s pipe, her eyes gazing out over her capering fingers to her playmates dressed in long, loose robes, some of whom stood alone, smiling, arms spread wide, while others danced in couples, leaning against one another, temples sweetly touching; and at the piper’s back—bent to one side in a long, graceful, white curve because of the way she held her arms—still more of her sisters sat or stood together, embracing, watching, and talking quietly
stop pampering and indulging your condition—stop talking about it
''i am not at all in the mood for jokes, adri, if only because the role you ascribe to me in your life-and even for posterity-touches my heart and makes me feel solemn somehow
moreover, he tried out going through a door without troubling to latch it behind him, but merely letting it close by itself; and that proved both convenient and easy—as an expression of feeling, it corresponded to the shrug with which joachim had greeted him that day at the train station and which since then he had often noticed people use here
he said, beg pardon, ma’am, for that callin’ card there
he sent it to him in lubeck, where that stutterer was still in charge, and a year later, even though war had already broken out, the theater there did indeed produce the opera, in a german version in which i had some involvement-with the result that two-thirds of the audience left the theater in the middle of the performance, just as is said to have happened in munich six years before at the premiere of debussy's pelleas et melisande
it announced itself most clearly in the songs of this series taken from the purgatorio and paradiso and chosen with a clever sense of their affinity with music-for instance, in the piece that especially fascinated me and that kretzschmar had also declared to be very good, where by the light of venus the poet beholds the lesser lights (which are the souls of the blessed) describing their circles, some more quickly, others more slowly, each according to its contemplation of god, and compares the various sparks distinguishable in the flame, the voices audible in the larger song, when the one entwines the other
because marusya, laughter-loving marusya, with the little ruby on her pretty finger, her orange-blossom perfume, and her prominent, worm-eaten chest, was usually present at the gathering as well; and hans castorp understood that it was this circumstance that drove joachim away, precisely because it held such a strong, terrible attraction for him
what a talented shipmate!
he seldom stayed there much over an hour; he would write two or three urgent letters and telegrams, give an order here, an instruction there, nudging, as it were, the great wheel of industry and leaving its further revolutions to the watchful eye and sidelong glances of herr marcus
and they all believed every word—she was so hopeless, dusty, and withered
from then on, if they chanced to meet in the village or on country lanes, they merely exchanged a friendly greeting or just stood for a few minutes conversing about their nation's sad state or the growing lack of food in the cities, which was so little a problem hereand which indeed lent the frau senator's seclusion a practical justification, the appearance of a deliberate precaution that allowed her to supply her daughters, even former friends of her house like the knoterichs, with goods from pfeiffering: eggs, butter, sausages, and flour
see them again—if only it were so
he was heading down the trough now, its walls rising on both sides—it seemed to be a fold, a narrow pass leading into the mountain itself
in it one had a piece that was intended for neither the human voice nor any known instrument, indeed for no sense-based realization whatever, but that was music per se, music as pure abstraction

he was still twenty paces from the long, red wall with its two wrought-iron gates that separated the front schoolyard from the street, when he heard the steady, shrill bell, the signal for the beginning of monday-morning prayers
these included: frau möllendorpf, née langhals, who was toying with a long-handled lorgnette, her gray hair flying in all directions; frau hagenström, plus julie, who had never grown all that much, but already wore diamond earrings like her mother; frau kistenmaker and her daughters; and frau fritsche, a small wrinkle-faced lady, who wore a bonnet and was in charge of the spa’s entertainments
with what was free and more than free, rebellious, as well as with passages that scorned every restraint of musical key; and so he had to fear that those sections of the score, with all their unfamiliarity and aggressive heresy, would be more inaccessible to an audience than would the orthodox and strict parts
you are speaking foolishness, my good engineer, herr settembrini responded
you are going to do all right, i finally said
satisfactory, the professor said when timm had finished
he talked about how new and fresh everything would be—life, himself, time, each day, each hour
you have every reason to say you speak as if in a dream, my friend
not everything done in madness should therefore be prevented at all cost, and the obligation to preserve life was discharged here in hardly anyone's interest except that of the mother-who doubtless prefers to find an infantile son rather than a dead one
you remarked that i speak maliciously, but if i have done so, then it was not without a pedagogic purpose
their words of greeting were lost in the barking of the watchdog, who trampled his bowls in his excitement and almost tugged loose his house bedded with straw
because feeling, young man, is divine
eight days later, a small, smooth-shaven old man with snow-white hair combed forward at his brow and temples visited senator buddenbrook in his private office
actually, when viewed from an emotional perspective, it was more that joachim lived at hans castorp’s side, and no longer the other way around—for the latter was now the old-timer, whose existence his cousin simply shared for a brief time as a visitor
the harmonium was like an overpowering dream, but he had no time to explore it more closely just yet
and if i scold him, he’ll blow up, because he’s testy beyond belief—and has rented three rooms for his family
he fashions it new and adds:  ameilleur '
his mother saw to it that he got exercise, putting her arm in his and taking him for walks across the silent landscape
well, that’s up to the highest standards, let me tell you, not a hint of slipshod manners and simply letting things take their course—just the contrary
after a while he tried again
instead he had labored in his room, on the credo, the credo with its fugue; his disciples could hear him working behind the closed door
dr krokowski was on hand as well
may those i love all-ready be
the girl still had her key ring and candle in hand—she must have been taking care of some late chore in the house—and she twisted and turned to defend herself against the master of the house, who was holding her in a tight embrace and kept trying to press his walrus face to hers, occasionally succeeding in the attempt, with the result that his hat kept slipping farther down the back of his head
fine, i won’t die, then
one could not speak in finer, clearer, more rounded phrases than herr settembrini
her hair was parted and pulled back smooth—and it was the same reddish blonde as always
and now they’re doin’ right good themselves and we sell ’em our hops and have a nice little income from the int’rest besides—’tain’t bad at all, herr permaneder concluded; and, declining either cigarette or cigar, he asked if he could smoke his pipe
the term that mother schweigestill had applied to him was jauntily justified, however, by the easy carelessness of his manners, by a refreshingly light touch, which was inherent both in his rapid, slightly blurred, rather high speaking voice, breaking at times into the treble, and in his whole demeanor, and which stood somewhat in contradiction to the stoutness of his figure and yet again, was in harmony with it
it turned out that his son’s illness had not involved any immediate danger, but that it was very wise to send him at once to a health spa in the mountains in the south of france; and as luck would have it, herr van der kellen’s young son had also been planning a vacation, and as soon as thomas was up to it, the two young men left together for pau
she had black eyes and wore golden earrings; a flirt who loved her finery, she was nevertheless a perfect job, a lazarus in a female body, whom god had visited with every sort of affliction
it found its most powerful, sensual realization in orchestral music, where, entering through the ear, it seemed to affect all the senses, to act as an opiate, allowing the pleasures of the realm of sound to melt with those of color and fragrance
jack frost had painted the window with flowers—the blind had been left rolled up to let the first daylight in
he called himself a recluse and did not intend it as any kind of praise
they would be staying here
and, grünlich, the consul said, those new laces are in the little handbag on top?
that’s quite a generalization, clavdia
there’s not even any fat on it—nothing but lean meat
he practiced the piano for a while and then just lounged around the living room
it is a metaphysical gift, something essential, a structure and a vocation
he expostulated that it was obvious from'that start that he was lost to any career as a virtuoso soloist; for no use killing nettles to grow docks, he wrote, and he had come into contact with the instrumentor even with the very notion ·of trying it out-much too late, in which one could clearly see a lack of any instinctual drive in that direction
there was music playing here, as well
mynheer suddenly asked, turning toward his guest a regal countenance with painfully ragged lips and pale little eyes under a brow full of arabesques
they now saw pictures from all over the world: the top-hatted president of the french republic reviewing a long cordon, then sitting in his landau to reply to a welcoming speech; the viceroy of india at the wedding of a rajah; the german crown prince on a barracks drill field in potsdam
they despised the usual nicknames given the teachers, because these were based on a humor that left them cold, didn’t even make them smile
saying something like that—if it really must be said
petersen clung to his book
even hans castorp smiled discreetly, and then they both nodded awhile in agreement
during his period of bed rest, he had made sparing use of the stock of two hundred he had brought with him and so still had some of those left
well, i’m not so certain about that
it was all a little haphazard for me
that much in my own justification and for your instruction
the malayan watched his every move without turning his head, but the whites of his eyes were clearly visible
the krögers no longer played any role at all; they lived in seclusion and continued to have dreadful troubles with their son
true, she hardly ever saw herr grünlich, but she knew he was in town, negotiating with her parents and waiting
but for some, that just do not work and it's not their way, and when the cheeks get wrinkly and the neck gets scrawny and there's not much in the way of teeth when they laugh, they feel shamed and fretful when they look in the mirror and avoid other people's eyes and get the urge to hide, like some sick kitten
which is to say, i want my capital
joachim replied curtly in the negative, his eyes lowered
the examination was over
and now that his second teeth were starting to come in, his sufferings increased
the lieutenant set me to rights—hmm, or should we say, set me to what was wrong, if that does not sound impolite
what a horrifying sight!
he also mentioned that he had been put on the list of candidates for the officer’s exam
and if as pedagogues we sow doubt, a doubt more profound than your modest enlightenment ever dreamed possible, we are well aware of what we are doing
should one take the children of the soil as models because they po·ssessed the depth of organic reality, whereas the ice flowers were mere external phenomena?
then he stepped back and began to pace the room, while his eyes wandered here and there
they had now circled back to the house, and schwerdtfeger still had time to share a little snack with his friend in the winged-victory room
it was not unusual for her parents to change roles like this out of courtesy—it only reinforced the unanimity of their opinions
now y’ take munich—from the way he pronounced the name of his hometown, one could only guess what he meant—munich ain’t no town for business
that is how a friendship marked by pain taught me to see music, although, given my own simple nature, i would perhaps have gladly seen something else in it
the consul thought, while returning a bow to the glasses lifted in his honor
he automatically opened the cigar cabinet, but immediately closed it again and then lifted the lid of a small oak chest on the card table—inside were playing cards, scoring pads, and similar items
adrian clapped a hand to his brow and apologized for his thoughtlessness
analysis is good as a tool of enlightenment and civilization—to the extent that it shakes stupid preconceptions, quashes natural biases, and undermines authority
and between the walls, the snow was packed so thick, despite all the shoveling, that here and there you came across holes and soft spots where you could suddenly sink in, sometimes up to the knee
doesn’t she even write you now and then, from her other places of residence?
tucking the cord of her pince-nez behind her ear with a sigh, she had hurried off to nurse him—it was the only prospect that had opened up for her
it was eleven o’clock in the morning
and little johann stopped in his tracks, swallowed hard, and hastily answered softly, yes, papa
he had not come here for that sort of thing, was certainly not here to enjoy his stay by organizing his life around a variety of diversions, but solely for the purpose of detoxifying his body as quickly as possible, so that he could take up his duties in the plains below, real duties, not just the duties of rest cure—which, even though it was only a substitute, he was loath to slight in any way
what spoke out of them, what triumphed within them, was technique as an ascetic religion—virtuosity for its own sake, holy in and of itself
herr naphta is not a priest
mere being lived in brute
the street itself was otherwise deserted, with only a few curious faces silhouetted against the light in the windows of the buildings, all staring down at the black mass of insurgents below
his brother, georg, who surely runs the farm up there nowadays, was his senior by five years
he was one of those people who always have to grab, feel, touch, an arm, an elbow, a shoulder
he looked at his cousin—who simply lowered his eyes—and then said, ah, herr settembrini, you take my words all too literally
and saith unto them, sleep on now, and take your rest
this is not about an advance
the gaze faltered, the unconscious strain left the features, the painful swelling vanished rapidly from the lips, a more handsome, youthful look spread across our joachim’s silenced countenance, and it was over
it permitted him the solitude he sought, the profoundest solitude imaginable, touching his heart with a precarious savagery beyond human understanding
there he lay, paying full price, and what they brought him at this hour of fixed eternity was midday soup, the six-course berghof dinner in all its splendor, with nothing missing—a hearty meal six days a week, a sumptuous showpiece, a gala banquet, prepared by a trained european chef in the sanatorium’s deluxe hotel kitchen
and, besides, each is then divided up into several parts itself—into melodic phrases, and those by the rhythm itself—so that something’s always going on and every moment takes on a certain meaning that a person can hold on to, whereas otherwise—i don’t know if i’m putting it right, but
indeed it rather wears me down, i must say
the leuchtenfeld flats, which got their name from the lighthouse that rose up somewhere off to the right, stretched out far before him under the bright white sky, until the short grass, interspersed with patches of bare earth, gave way to taller shore vegetation and then to the sandy beach, where he could make out rows of little private wooden pavilions and wicker beach chairs facing the open sea
and second, this is definitely not to say that the things i have described must go on at every performance of a progressive nature
for that same reason i now want to invite the reader to accompany us young sons of the muses on the long walks beyond halle that we all enjoyed taking together in good weather
we have called it a basement, but although the stone stairway leading down to it from the ground floor did indeed create the impression of a descent into a basement, this was almost entirely an illusion, the reasons for which were, first, that the ground floor sat rather high, and second, that the whole edifice had been built on a steep, mountainous slope, so that the basement rooms faced the front and looked out onto the garden and the valley—a state of affairs countered and negated, as it were, by the effect of the stairway
do you know how you get goose bumps?
in addition there is apparently an active proclivity for catarrh in the upper respiratory system
au revoir, my dear jean
without saying a word, he stands up
for breisacher, biblical personages revered by every christian child (such as king david and king solomon, as well as the prophets with their pious harangues about god in his heaven) were already decrepit representatives of a diluted late theology, which no longer had any notion of the old and genuinely hebrew presence of yahweh, the people's elohim, and saw only riddles of ancient days
he would do worse here than the russian lady from the baltic region
so much has changed and will have to go right on changing
was large enough to lend its owner the title of freeholder or yeoman and comprised a good eighty acres of fields and meadows, a share in some cooperatively managed woodland, and a very comfortable timberwork house set on a stone foundation
and there’s no doubt he will handle the matter with a shrewdness equal to his very high fee
the truth was that the consul had left behind a much more considerable fortune than anyone would have imagined
although he was only a visiting guest up here, he, too, found it to be a very suitable arrangement
he will leave me
in my opinion the blackguard was intent not just on extorting pleasure, but also on her death
deep vertical furrows of contempt and ill humor formed between hans castorp’s eyebrows, and from under those furrows he gazed at the returned traveler five times a day, happy at least to gaze at her, but filled with scorn for the exalted personage who had not the least notion what an odd light past events cast upon him
now and then his chest gave an uneasy heave, and then he would have to cough his bronchial cough
while the consul smoked cigarettes and herr permaneder puffed away on several very black cigars and drank his beer, the family sat chatting with their guest for quite a long time
i have no choice but to listen to you play some of your student songs, morten, though i find them awfully boring
joachim had caught up by now
ottilie had no fever
degrees—that was too high, it was a fever, the result of an infection to which he had been susceptible
and it had hardly any for him, either, for unless a migraine had silenced him, he was a lively contributor to the day's conversation; and although nature elicited from him no cries of enthusiasm and he gazed at her with a certain meditative reserve, i nonetheless have no doubt that her images, rhythms, and high-borne melodies entered more deeply into his soul than into those of the others, so that in later years many a fleeting passage of pure, unruffled beauty emerging from his intellectually taut work has made me
the state, my dear sir—
why must almost everything appear to me as its own parody?
seven hours in heavy, rain-sodden coats, with battle gear—this was no promenade
little dark curls fell down across his immobile, yellowish brow, which looked as if it were made of some noble, yet delicate material halfway between wax and marble, and the arch of his lips was full and proud under his slightly curly moustache
he, naphta, regretted having to disappoint his vis-à-vis, for he found the humanist fear of the very word illiteracy merely amusing
the permaneders had been living together in munich as man and wife for several weeks when consul buddenbrook finally was able to convert into cash the amount specified in his father’s will for his sister’s dowry, a total of fifty-one thousand marks courant, which sum was then converted into guldens and was received intact by herr permaneder, who then transferred it to secure and profitable investments
he now took up his position and glanced at the window while he stuck a forefinger, the one with a large signet ring, down inside his collar and rubbed
and he patted the neck of his imaginary nag
frau stöhr, sitting just a little behind him, had an expression on her face revealing such ignorant ecstasy that it was pitiful to behold, while fräulein levi of the ivory complexion sat leaning back in her chair with half-closed eyes and hands resting palms-up in her lap—and one would have taken her for a corpse if her chest had not risen and fallen with such striking regularity, although hans castorp thought she looked more like a mechanically driven wax figure he had once seen in a sideshow
are we supposed to turn it into a tenement?
did he think the other members of the party had?
the group included naphta and settembrini, hans castorp, ferge, and wehsal
but just before that, i saw the hujus girl’s head emerge for a mere second, her light blond hair, and her pale eyes, no color to them at all, gaping wide, staring at the priest—and then she ducked under the sheets again with a loud wail
rising slightly from his seat at the piano and respectfully lowering his head to the hand she offered him, he brought his left hand down on the firm, clear chords of a fifth, whereupon gerda picked up her stradivarius and quickly tuned the strings with a practiced ear
a pale red sunset that had enlivened the generally overcast sky faded now, leaving nature under the transient sway of the lackluster, lifeless, and mournful light that immediately precedes nightfall
it has an absolutely medieval ring
all the same—we cannot be so imprudent as to depend too much on that
shortly after the holidays, the austrian horseman died
only a very few old veterans, joachim said, were able to fling both blankets around them at once in three deft motions, but that was a rare and coveted skill, which demanded not only years of practice, but also a natural predisposition
to be sure, to be sure, hans castorp replied superciliously
how strange that lament for culture, raised now against crimes that we called down upon ourselves, sounds in the mouths of those who entered the arena of history proclaiming themselves bearers of a barbarism that, while wallowing in ruthlessness, was to rejuvenate the world
that’s not a stupid way to put it, hans, she said, and her slanted eyes grew fixed, lost in thought
well, fine, then, ziemssen
there are times when she’s more quiet and serious and caught up in her own thoughts, and then he scolds her and flares up, says things that, to be honest, are not exactly considerate
inez, the older sister, was likewise destined for a tragic deed
your husband has left himself open, there can be no doubt of that
many thanks, mynheer peeperkorn
what was happening inside him could shock me, but never drive me from him
just think of all that water
it was all done in the old style—gothic arches still sedately spanned corridors and arcades
let’s go to bed
demoiselle meyer–de la grange was the latest in this year’s series of actresses whom he had favored with diamonds
he did so in a quasi-humanistic sense, in order to highlight the lofty view these ostensibly dark ages had fostered for the exclusive status of the human body
he determined that both heart and lungs were working quite vigorously, but that the occasional shortness of breath could be traced to a sluggishness in certain muscles, and prescribed both the use of a fan to ease respiration and a greenish powder that one first ignited in order to breathe its fumes
it’s a large sum, a very large sum
and the source of the terrible disgrace when feeling is lacking, when there is an inability to awaken the female to desire
in a word, a confused soul
so that quite a bit is happening backstage
and there you have your own intimate photograph, taken with no apparatus at all
you really should have a look, it’s so refreshing to watch her
he knows what he wants, he continued, and it is rather embarrassing that i do not know precisely
her father continued to probe her with his eyes
you will have to think and act for us all, because gerda and i are just women, and christian—well, god bless him
both cousins were surprised by the luxury of the two-windowed study into which they had stepped—indeed, they were dazzled, for they had not expected anything of the sort given the shabby little house with its dingy corridor and stairway, in contrast to which naphta’s furnishings seemed almost fabulously elegant, when in point of fact they weren’t, nor would hans castorp or joachim ziemssen normally have regarded them as such
that culture as an idea was a historically transitory phenomenon, that it could lose itself again in some other idea, that the future did not necessarily belong to it-he had most definitely extracted that notion from kretzschmar's lecture
terribly, hans castorp said, terribly lifelike skin
i can only answer: it was the music that made the gift possible-the music of these verses, which lies in so light a slumber that it needed only the gentlest touch of an expert hand to awaken it
can’t say i know that exactly, either
they completely avoided the german element-schildknapp would invariably take flight the moment a sound of his mother tongue struck his ear; he was perfectly capable of climbing right back off an omnibus or train if he encountered germans there
he was, in reality, bored by the small, steady, secure commissions he made on the sale of this or that piece of real estate, but this loss, this tragic blow that heaven had struck against him, the great schemer, was pure joy, a source of happiness on which he feasted for weeks afterward
we’re in the same boat, he declared cheerfully
at one point the beach turned rocky, and they climbed up into the woods to reach the path that led to the temple of the sea—a round pavilion of logs and planks, its interior full of carved inscriptions, initials, hearts, and poems
the butchers had set up their stalls under the pointed arches of the town-hall arcades, and they weighed their wares with bloody hands
what our age needs, what it demands, what it will create for itself, is—terror
it didn’t make me any happier, as you can well imagine
hans castorp, who could not look at this ill-mannered woman without feeling some disapproval, thought to himself: she reminds me of something, but i can’t really say what
she felt confident that she could hold him, bind him, domesticate this wild creature
ah yes, very sad, grätjens the broker said, and when you think what madness led to their ruin—if only dietrich ratenkamp hadn’t made geelmaack a partner
this was the frightening course hans castorp’s thoughts took
so you see the fracases a fellow is constantly getting involved in, even when he would much rather keep quiet and go his pure and spotless way
as if that were not enough, he wrote a series of sizable choral works with texts taken directly from the bible
we know what we are saying when we add—perhaps somewhat darkly—that his fate might have been different if his disposition had not been so highly susceptible to the charms of the emotional sphere, to the universal state of mind that this song epitomized so intensely, so mysteriously
but as regards me, your eldest son, you have gone so far in your un-christian anger as to refuse me outright any compensation for my share in the house!
in his shock, hans castorp stammered, you asked if—that is—but of course i respect frau chauchat in her position as—
and i can rattle off the litany of the rule’ and observe it quite faithfully
there’s your new house, a dream come true
on the one hand, his love was caught up—and with such an immediacy that it could make the young man blanch and grimace—in frau chauchat’s knee, the contour of her leg, her back, the nape of her neck, her upper arms and the way they pressed her small breasts together, in brief, caught up in her body, her careless body, so accentuated and vastly enhanced by her illness that it was a second embodiment of her body
it was all about a kind of poisoning, about the organism poisoning itself, which, dr krokowski had said, was the result of the decomposition of a certain, still-unidentified substance present throughout the body; the by-products of that decomposition had an intoxicating effect on certain centers in the spinal cord, not all that different from what happens when other poisons, such as morphine or cocaine, are introduced into the body
he was nervous and anxious himself, because the awkward situation in schleswig-holstein had set the stock market in turmoil
even hanno buddenbrook was unable to resist this impression, although he sensed something deep inside rebelling against the idea
hans castorp had been unaware of her sudden turn for the worse and exitus; otherwise he would gladly have taken part in her burial, both out of friendship and his admitted love of funerals in general
be that in all humility, my friend, not with strut and bluster; and always bear in mind that self-satisfaction is itself apostasy and ingratitude to the spender of every mercy!
as noted, mutual sympathy was at work here, the kind of family affection and affinity of personality that not infrequently leaps a generation
circumstances did not exactly offer luck excessive latitude
but be and remain himself, except lifted to his natural elevation by his half-bottle of champagne, and might in drunken indulgence taste every bliss of almost intolerable infusion, till he be convinced more or less rightly that there has not been such an infusion for thousands of years and till in certain wanton moments he may plainly and honestly deem himself a god
his voice had grown strangely impassioned
and who will dispute that hopeful progress in that direction was indeed discernible among us-everywhere throughout germany, that is, with the exception of one or two obstinate spots, of which our good city of munich was an exemplary model?
he just washed his hands quickly; and they walked down to the dining hall, for the third time
what is life like in old scratch's house?
and even in terms of the objects and faces that made up the details of a day, hans castorp had to learn at every step to take a closer, less casual look at accustomed facts and faces and assimilate new things with youthful receptivity
what do you have against analysis?
and rightly so, rightly so
and he observed the other guests, too—the crowd was beginning to sort itself out for him and individuals were emerging
with clara’s hand in his, sievert tiburtius talked about his parents, his youth, and his plans for the future; the arnoldsens told about the history of their family, which had originated in dresden and only one branch of which had been transplanted to holland
all the same, he was summoned to rhadamanthus out of turn
would you attest to your reputed stupidity and bell yourself as a cat, by wanting to found your business and promise on so pliant, so captious a term as-'love'?
and in the morning he would remember nothing at all
the now· predominantly gray beard made the narrow face look even longer, so that it bore a striking resemblance to that of a nobleman by el greco
it was about abstractions, about ideas
such industry and invention will not be found a second time on god’s good, wide earth
things take care of themselves
but that hand betrayed an infinitely sad and soft surrender to memories, to sweet longings that drifted into the distance
on the table was a long row of gingerbread cakes, glazed and sprinkled with almonds, alternating with loaves of marzipan bread, so fresh they were still moist inside
we are about to introduce it, since we ourselves are much taken by that mysterious object’s secret charms and are honestly eager to share them
for me not to set all too much store by schwerdtfeger's charms-that is, to warn me against them
i have been damned from the start with the need to laugh at the most mysterious and impressive spectacles, and i fled from my exaggerated sense of the comic into theology, hoping it would soothe the tickle-only to find a lot of things awfully comic there as well
and no one was about to abandon that hope
you probably want to make fun of my serenus
it is quite clear: when she was an object of courtship, her thoughts turned to him in sorrow; as an experienced wife, she fell in love with him, fully aware of what that meant and with all her feelings and desires for him intact
his primary object was director behrens—he sneered at the size of the man’s feet and lingered over his title of hofrat, which had been bestowed on him by a prince suffering from tuberculosis of the brain
tony was almost a little ashamed and for the first time felt inclined to see something laudable in herr permaneder’s lack of passion when it came to money matters
but i had to lie in bed for four weeks when i first arrived, joachim objected
then he said, all the better, gentlemen
christian, however, had no opinion whatever; he confined himself to wrinkling up his nose and observing these gentlemen in order to imitate them later at the club or for his family
but that in no way affected the look of pride and joy that appeared in the consul’s eyes when he thought of his eldest son
tony had heard such remarks often enough so that she was not inclined to have an especially high opinion of julie hagenström
the senator stopped here, turned his back on the hunchbacked apprentice, and broke open the telegram
hans castorp stirred his spoon in his cup, although there was nothing in it
the hands had turned a blackish blue, as had parts of the face, resulting in considerable disfigurement, although the regal features were unaffected
wild horses couldn’t get him here
but it’s best we not speak of it
then he once again sank back into a brown study
but hans castorp was bent forward, glancing up only fleetingly while drawing figures in the sand with the silver-trimmed knob of his citified cane
but i am bringing with me the promise that all three arnoldsens—gerda, her father, and her married sister—will visit us in august
he could not express, he wrote its composer, how the work took his breath away in its boldness, its novelty
they said he would spend the whole day with germans at the gaming table, and for no modest stakes, but of an evening he would play with his own generals
and a light fever now, too—oh, insignificant, but fever nonetheless
he is, i would say, too comfortable a man for that, he takes life too easy—which is, however, a fault in its own way, too
his good-natured bushy moustache bobbed violently up and down
perhaps what instills such an insurmountable aversion in me is a certain mawkish dishonesty to which the vice lends itself, or that is peculiar to it from the start
you’re being ridiculous—your hands feel satisfied
then he would sprawl back again in all his grandeur, lay one arm across the back of a neighboring chair, and bewilder them all by demanding they plunge with him into his vivid, keen imaginings of morning—of a frosty, dark winter morning, when the yellowish glow of a nightstand lamp is mirrored in the window-pane and shines out into bare branches, stiff in the icy fog of a morning harsh with the cries of crows
and friedrich wilhelm of prussia’s doing poorly, herr buddenbrook
except that herr permaneder let the chance go by and confined himself to censuring herr grünlich in such strong terms that the goatee on his little round chin bristled
mendelssohn, for whom, as you know, i have a tender spot, took up, so to speak, with beethoven's third period, ie, with his multivoiced style-and at something else and more than an ambling gait
as in the past, he often suffered from the vague but unconquerable fear of a sudden paralysis of his tongue, throat, and extremities—even of his intellectual powers
and what are we to her?
it was originally nothing more than the attempt by a man of action to be certain that from head to toe he displayed the impeccable correctness that sustains self-confidence
in your twenty-fourth year, you say?
a quarter past two—that’s as good as half past; and half past two is the same as half till three, for heaven’s sake
they did not speak much, only the phrases a normal day at the berghof brought to their lips, nothing more
but then settembrini added, over a glass of wine, on the evening of mardi gras, my good engineer, you will recall that you more or less took your leave of me—yes, it was very like a good-bye
in short, nothing happened, and that was, to use hans’s term, no more and no less than a mystery
they walked toward the pier, taking the boardwalk laid well above the waterline; and as they passed the boulders where morten schwarzkopf was sitting reading, tony quickly nodded to him several times from a distance
on the left the lot was separated from the neighbor’s garden by a wall, but on the right it was bounded by the house next door, covered to the roofline with a wooden lattice, which in time would be home to climbing vines
i can read from your relatively broad face that there is the danger of—bread,
his lips were pressed tight and turned down maliciously at the corners, and the gaze he directed at the senator was so nasty, piercing, and treacherous that it seemed incomprehensible why the latter would not prefer to avoid the company of such a man
if it’s all right with you, we can go to breakfast—tous les deux, he added as a joke, in a burst of high spirits
there she sat with them in her checked house apron, an oval brooch at its rounded neckline, her back straight, her brown hair only slightly flecked with gray and pulled back tight and smooth, so that the part revealed the white skin of her head; her small, well-formed, competent hands, a plain wedding band on the right one, were neatly folded on the tabletop
even when he appeared to be relaxing—reading his newspapers after dinner, for instance—a thousand plans were simultaneously at work in his brain, while he slowly, even passionately twirled one long tip of his mustache and the veins on his pallid temples swelled and stood out
he could be certain that any literary efforts beyond these were not demanded or expected of him
in his silent matter-of-factness, he left no doubt that he recognized his elder brother’s superiority, his greater expertise, competence, and respectability
asterisks, too, serve to refresh the reader's eye and mind-it does not always require a roman numeral, which gives a new section even stronger definition; and i could not possibly have granted a chapter of its own to the foregoing excursus on a present that adrian leverkiihn did not himself experience
true, the orchestra’s second-rate violins had faltered a little during the overture, and the boat, carrying a fat, conceited man with a reddish-blond beard, had entered by fits and starts
was joachim locked up here, too?
pastor pringsheim’s eulogy probed the gaping wound that death had left; he quite intentionally evoked vivid memories of what each of them had lost; he knew how to squeeze tears from those who would never have shed them on their own and were all the more grateful for having been so moved
closest to the door stood a group of less important men: two or three shopkeepers; a high-school teacher; herr mindermann, the orphanage director; and herr wenzel, the well-liked barber
they had better wait, not make any moves
no, i would do better to speak only of myself, of my enchantment, my delight-!
do you think i don’t have eyes in my head?
hans castorp now operated the machine
for in that is found goodness and brotherly love, and in that alone
all the good things that madame permaneder envisioned when she was expecting are ready and waiting
i believe that god made me—
i can’t seem not to, even though it makes everything worse
i had a brief conversation with gosch the broker this afternoon—such a bizarre man, who sees everything with the eyes of a poet and dramatist
next—whoever feels up to it, he shouted, staring into the air
and after his demise—well, even after that, hans castorp’s relationship to the local landscape, if one ignores his ski outings, had maintained its conservative, monotone character, a trait that had held a certain special charm for the young man when he contrasted it with the range of his inner experiences and the duties involved in playing king
what had been his objections?
yes, yes—herr settembrini has done a splendid job of helping me pass the time—though that’s a poor way of putting it
i stand there conversing with him for some five minutes
it’s strange, i can never picture you doing anything else
your individualism, as i made bold to remark before, is a makeshift thing, a series of concessions
yes, here i am, but i’ve come with a heavy heart today
you’d never know it, hans castorp said
the young people—totally languid, stuffed with roasts and desserts, all slightly feverish—chatted, joked, and flirted with their eyes
yes i am, tony, he said emphatically
but he was still waiting for something else, too, although he did not really ask himself what it was
and i repeat, we should have chatted long before this
how did young hans castorp actually feel about all this?
even when it is a matter of a pure and authentic genius, bestowed or perhaps inflicted hy god, rather than an acquired and destructive genius, a sinful and morbid necrosis of natural talents, the fruition of some horrible pact
what are you doing up here?
do that, hans castorp said
'the last chapter of world history
would you like to see it?
to be sure, it is a german superstition that there is nothing but valse brillante in the world outside, and seriousness only in germany
and so the prosecutor now had a free hand either to do battle over frau wurmbrandt, or to come to an understanding with the swede
indeed we sat there until lnstitoris returned from the allotria, where he had been playing tarok with some other gentlemen
he went back into the room to run a brush through his hair; as he did, joachim took another look at the thermometer on the washstand—and hans castorp watched him from a distance
and since old newspaper would also be recycled as valuable packing paper and cardboard, which would then provide an important economic base for national and local taxation, the plan would also reduce the tax burden on newspaper subscribers
lighted to the point of elation
clear out, dear out, run along, back to the barracks!
there was no porter, unfortunately
and then a swim, which was much more enjoyable here than at herr asmussen’s—there wasn’t any goose grass here, only pale green, crystal-clear water that foamed when you splashed it, and instead of slimy wooden planks there was gently rilled sand under your feet, and consul hagenström’s boys were far, far away, in norway or tyrolia
you’re something of a coward, man, a phony, and if your cousin calls you a civilian, that’s merely a very euphemistic way of putting it
the family dining room was located upstairs and adjoined an even larger kitchen, where friends from the village were received and which had a vast, gloomy chimney and was hung full with ladles out of a fairy tale and carving knives and forks that could have belonged to an ogre, its shelves filled with copper utensils, saucepans, bowls, platters, terrines, and mortars, and was ruled over by signora manardi; called nella by her family (i believe her name was peronella), a stately matron of the roman type, with an arched upper lip, kindly brown (but not dark brown, just chestnut) eyes and hair pulled smoothly and tightly back and flecked with silver; her full evenly proportioned figure was that of a competent and simple country woman-and one would often see her small, but work-roughened hands, a double widow's band on the right one, set akimbo on sturdy hips bound tightly by apron strings
you do regard this as one of your duties here, am i not right, lieutenant?
which news do you mean?
there were paintings everywhere, the director’s paintings—the visitors’ eyes at once began courteously to wander over them, ready to admire
it is not true clarity, but a dreamy, empty clarity that demands nothing of us, a clarity without consequences, and therefore dangerous, because it seduces us to take our ease beside it
adrian said to me, but a novel
a sign that he was well aware of the rules he had broken
while inspecting a harbor warehouse on a windy day the following spring, he caught pneumonia, and since, despite all the conscientious attention given him by dr heidekind, his already agitated heart could not hold out against the high fever, he, too, was dead within five days
but they weren’t, and in all honesty hans castorp had not assumed they would be—to tell the truth, from his personal point of view, he would not have understood it if they had remained quiet
i am honored by your offer, she said, as calmly as she could, but i cannot accept it
director behrens threw his arms above his shoulders and let them fall, noisily slapping his thighs
consul fritsche, an older gentleman with a distinguished clean-shaven face, was standing up in the pavilion, busily directing a telescope at a sailboat visible in the distance
i don’t really understand much more about it myself, and i’ve never met a literary man before
he was a totally different sort of fellow, as we shall see
her daughter, who had also been invited, had visited her husband in prison that afternoon and, as was always the case afterward, had felt tired and out of sorts and so had remained at home
the old man exclaimed and pretended to be itching all over with curiosity
the next time they would appoint someone to be secretary and then check how it sounded when you had it fixed in black and white and could read it as a whole; for the moment, however, and before holger returned to the serenity of his hastening while, it would be much better, or in any event extraordinarily kind of him, if he would be willing perhaps to answer one or two practical questions the group still had for him—not that they had anything definite in mind, but, just on principle, would he be prepared in that case to do them this special favor?
there were many times of an evening when adrian's father would open his books with colorful illustrations of exotic moths and sea creatures, and we all-his sons and i, and on occasion frau leverkiihn as well-would gather to gaze from over the back of his leather wing chair; and he would point with his forefinger at the splendors and oddities pictured there: the papilios and morphos of the tropics, flitting along, somber and radiant, in all the colors of the palette, configured and patterned with the most exquisite taste any artisan could ever invent-insects that in their fantastically exaggerated beauty eke out an ephemeral life and some of which native peoples consider to be evil spirits that bear malaria
hans castorp sat there, chin in hand
but working against these influences was the jealous insult he felt as a result of his conquest's change of mind, so that he was now only good enough to be a tool, a means to an end; and i do believe that secretly he felt free-th�t is, felt no obligation to return such demanding unfaithfulness with faithfulness
and then, finally, there were adrian and rudiger schildknapp, who for month after month remained within the peacefully austere circle we had come to know, living a life no different from that of the monks in the cloister up the hill
and i suppose you think that’s news to me, do you?
thirty-five thousand marks courant, due within less than two weeks
it occurred after dinner; they ran into one another at the door that no longer slammed
several times he had inserted fugues into subsequent piano music, but in a three-voiced form: both in the hammerklavier sonata and in the one that begins in a-flat major
the humanist then took advantage of this animated mood to explain further about how one ought to pay no attention to those who suffered from hallucinations, to pazzi in general, advancing the proposition that such people let themselves get carried away, quite illegitimately, and often had it within their power to control their madness, as he had himself observed on several visits to madhouses
there he sat, sporting a little beard that he had let grow by then, a blond goatee, the color of straw and of rather indefinite shape, which we are forced to interpret as a sign of a certain philosophical indifference to his appearance
and without a word of thanks, she nonchalantly took a cigarette from the silver case he held out to her, then accepted a light from the pocket lighter he let flicker before her face as she leaned forward
the votin’ now is between hagenström, kistenmaker, ’nd buddenbrook
he can never get past the start—the same lines he was just sobbing over in his sleep just now
yes, we are a completely different nation, one that is a contradiction to sobriety and common sense and whose soul is powerfully tragic; our love belongs to fate, any fate, if only it is one, even a doom that sets the heavens afire with the red twilight of the gods
it is a responsibility, doctor
to be sure, if you looked more closely, there were wildflowers that gently made the same point
to be sure, these crea-
he guided him slowly along a few steps of gravel walk to the glistening white stairway that led to the dining room
in short, one cannot help speaking about it in confusion commensurate with his confused impressions
on the wall across from the door were several high racks hung with coats and hats
that hasn’t changed in the past few days
the only objection i would raise against him is that polyphony came too easily to him
oh, a place where they eat their cake with a knife, where even princes can’t get their don’ts and doesn’ts straight, and where they think a gentleman is courting a woman if he picks up her fan for her—it’s easy to be thought arrogant in a place like that, tom
can i help it if phthisis is accompanied by increased concupiscence?
i feel as if i should like to-as if i must see her always, have her near me always
we call it a creeping sensation in order to differentiate between its purely physical and its psychological aspects, since there was hardly any sense of horror involved
certainly, the arts and music in particularno less than the sciences-assumed a subservient, subsidiary role in relation to the study and worship of god; and that idea was associated with certain discussions we had once had about art's destiny, about its emancipation from the cult, its cultural secularization-which ory
he propped his elbows against the cushion behind him, his chin in one hand, and gazed at them for a while from a distance
then all three of them left
illness battered its victim until they got along with one another: the senses were diminished, there were lapses in consciousness, a merciful self-narcosis set in—all means by which nature allowed the organism to find relief, to adapt mentally and morally to its condition, and which the healthy person naively forgot to take into account
my good engineer, you are a wag
it was perhaps no matter that her marriage with pastor tiburtius had not been blessed with children, particularly since clara buddenbrook had never wanted them and almost certainly had very few of the requisite maternal talents
behind the glass door that opened onto the second floor was a small hallway
i repeat, he said, raising a finger lance, while the wineglass continued to tremble in his other hand, i repeat, that it is our duty, our religious duty to feel
it felt as if the humidity had doubled; in less than a second the atmospheric pressure rose rapidly, alarmingly, oppressing heart and brain and making breathing difficult
for here, in a most remarkable fashion, he found himself reminded of his own—or should one say, his former—profession and of the fact that on his arrival he had presented himself to whomever he met, from dr krokowski to herr settembrini, as a member of the scientific caste
he was merely suggesting they give it a try
the surface offers greater difficulties
the music of ephrata, kretzschmar told us, had been too unusual, too strangely unorthodox, to be adopted by the outside world, and it had therefore fallen into practical oblivion once the sect of german seventh day baptists had ceased to flourish
until adrian's arrival, nikolaus, a widower-his wife had died young-had lived in the house alone with an old, long-time housekeeper, frau butze; a maid; and a young italian from brescia named luca cimabue (he did indeed carry the family name of that thirteenthcentury painter of madonnas), an apprentice who assisted in making violins-for uncle leverkiihn was also a violin-maker
and to play it for the masses-pure nonsense!
why frighten him unnecessarily?
christian sat staring mutely at the theater for a while, blinking his eyes as if deep in thought
(he was twenty-nine as he lived and breathed)
she lacked his humor, but was the personification of the energetically hospitable housewife and was of one accord with her husband about the pleasures of sheltering fame in her home and allowing the carefree spirit of virtuosity to reign within its walls
there’s a slit in the lid, or so you think, and it’s on a slant
i know this building well
these young people who have joined to celebrate with us older folks probably cannot imagine that things were ever any different
his own music theory, one suited to his special purposes; he froze out the singing teacher and took matters firmly in hand-with such success that within a short time he had made music the most important element in the religious life of the settlement
the great-aunt gave her some candies, konfekti as she called them in russian; the teacher, fräulein engelhart, appeared, as did the man from mannheim—although he stood off at some distance, watching gloomily; but then his mournful eyes glided up to the window, where he had spotted hans castorp, and lingered gloomily there for a while
the excellent pedagogue expanded eloquently, though somewhat nervously, on his opinions, spoke of the important difference between a line and a stroke, mentioned the lovely woodland green as well as the coal box, making frequent use during the course of his visit of the word consequently, which seemed to him aptly suited to his elegant surroundings
ah, it ought not be!
c’est une abdication, she said
settembrini’s smile was not forced this time; he was sure of himself
they all were to get up by artificial light, go without breakfast, and gather in the bitter chill of morning—that had been the agreement
joachim listened for hours to the sound coming from his cousin’s balcony: a paper knife slipping through uncut pages
the path opening before you today is the one to which destiny has called you, as you well know
he left his sinewy throat exposed and was no friend of standard city attire, which did not do anything for his looks, and especially not for his hands-a strong, tanned, parched, and lightly freckled hand whose grip completely covered the head of his cane whenever he set out for a council meeting in the village
fiance were to find her out, she always had the stuff that could put everything to rights and that she had kept for ages inside her objet d'art, inside the book with the skull
an hour later he was cradled in the highly civilized atmosphere of the berghof
it was hans castorp’s turn to answer
soothes one’s cares away, catches fire like brandy, but, all the same, she packs something of a wallop toward the end
hanno was eleven now, and along with his little friend count mölln he had been promoted to the fourth grade, but by the skin of his teeth—it had taken two extra exams in arithmetic and geography
someone just went in
thomas was not in the mood to think about that
he would cry, just as he always did when someone demanded that he perform, drilled him, tested his abilities and cleverness, the way papa loved to do
there could be no question of surprise on my part, nor would there have been even if, without any preparation, i had one day been presented with a fait accompli
you do that very well, hans castorp said
just prompt me a little, todtenhaupt, if i get called on, hanno begged, shoving the book away
but the style of the entire work was strictly that of chamber music, a filigree handiwork, a clever grotesquery of notes, humorous and ingenious in its combinations and rich with the inventions of a refined playfulness; and any lover of music who, weary of romantic democracy and popular moralistic harangues, might have demanded an art or for art's sake, or for artists' and experts' sake, art with no ambitions or rather with only the most exclusive ambitions, would have had to be enraptured by this self-centered and perfectly cool esotericism-which in the esoteric spirit of the piece, however, at every turn mocked and exaggerated itself as parody, mixing a drop of sadness, a grain of hopelessness into the rapture
space, as it rolls and tumbles away between him and his native soil, proves to have powers normally ascribed only to time; from hour to hour, space brings about changes very like those time produces, yet surpassing them in certain ways
hans castorp was silent, too
indeed no doctor was at hand, not one among so many concertgoersalthough doctors do tend to be musical, if only because there are so many who are jewish
they were in the duchy of oldenburg now
it was exactly as if someone had taken hold of his brain and with incredible force started swinging it in wide concentric circles that grew smaller and smaller, so that it picked up speed, frightening speed, as it whirled around and around, until at last it crashed with tremendous, brutal, merciless force against the stone-hard center of the circle
and hans castorp experienced much the same thing
clarissa, she reported, truly loved her artistic profession and was not allowing the joy she took in it to be diminished by a certain coldness of the audience, the nit-picking of critics, or the cheeky cruelty of various directors who attempted to spoil her mood by shouting pick it up!
what sort of malarkey is that, smolt!
the gentlemen on the exchange nodded to one another and said, buddenbrook is out to make money, and how!
i implore you, madam—where were you?
it’s much too small a space for dancing
but once the postlude to the choral anthem was over and herr pfühl had slowly removed all ten fingers from the keys to let the bass of the tonic chord echo softly and solemnly, there would be a meaningful, artful pause, and then pastor pringsheim would lift up his voice from beneath the canopy of the pulpit; and at that point, it was not unusual for herr pfühl to start mocking the sermon and to laugh at pastor pringsheim’s stylized franconian accent, his long and dark or sharply accented vowels, his sighs, and the abrupt shifts of darkness and transfiguration passing over his face
no, you have nothing to do with the devil
kai’s mood was vastly improved by the sight of the lord god, who continued to terrorize everyone for a while, turning faces ashen as he snarled horribly and pointed in various directions at the litter of sandwich papers tossed aside here and there around the brick courtyard
and now, and now … to sell it …
for the message to be inaccessible, and for one to immerse oneself in that contradiction-that also has its pleasure
a problem child, that’s certainly what i’ve been for you and your pedagogic streak—you spoke about that the very first day
prosecutor paravant had been given a hefty slap on the cheek from the transcendent world, and had received it with scientific amusement, had even eagerly turned the other cheek—despite his being a cavalier, lawyer, and alumnus of a dueling fraternity, all of which would have demanded quite different conduct had the blow’s origin been from the world of the living
this remark contained two jokes
and so, after she had devoured her cake and chocolate, she would pick up her school bag, skip across the terrace, and walk down through the well-tended front garden
well, cheer up, hans castorp said, as he sat down on his cousin’s bed in room
did director behrens also tell you about a certain russian woman whom we had here for five months last year—no, wait, the year before last?
then, while they sang the first verse of o, tannenbaum in rather subdued voices, they moved through the rooms to the grand hall
and that, i think, is premature, precisely because you can’t be sure
they spent recess hand in hand, and he talked about his home, about the puppies and chickens; and sometimes he was even allowed to join hanno at lunchtime, although ida jungmann always stood waiting at the school gate with a package of sandwiches, ready to take her charge for their midday stroll
he now gazed out across the room where people were coming and going: early breakfast was not a strictly communal affair
you may regard the sum, if you wish, as a final settlement, as your daughter’s inheritance, as an interest-bearing loan
but that was no good, since joachim would have heard him get up, and so he decided he had best put it off and catch behrens sometime later in the afternoon
germans, the fledging university student said, a blade of grass in his mouth,  have two-tracked minds and a way of illegitimately combining ideas
but little johann was no longer little, he was fifteen years old now, and, despite his delicate health, she could no longer be of much help to him
music is invaluable as the ultimate means for awakening our zeal, a power that draws the mind trained for its effects forward and upward
on one such occasion he learned that young buddenbrook was called hanno at home, and he immediately adopted the nickname and never called him anything else from then on
you have made a stroke!—he said struck instead of stroke
he waited, his spine pressed against the high chairback, his gaze clairvoyant at hearing that voice anew; but he was once again uncertain whether she was still behind him, afraid that the scraps of music from the next room might have drowned out her departing footsteps
she picks up the silk dresses, plus a whole stack of underclothes, and leaves
that experienced soul followed her back, bringing along a farm hand, who, after repeated calls and knocks by the women,
the collection was now split in two—the muscovites declaring they wanted to present behrens a gift of their own
did i get into this carriage with you to talk about him?
could he ever explain to his father, his grandfather, or any of his fellow merchants how he could play with such an idea, let alone put it into words?
it was after a meal, she was standing in the dining room with both hands in the pockets of her sweater, trying to carry on a conversation with another patient, an acquaintance from the lounging arcade presumably, struggling in a most charming way, as hans castorp could hear, to speak german; and he suddenly discovered a pride in his own mother tongue that he had never known before—and, simultaneously, an urge to sacrifice that pride to the enchantment that filled him at the sound of her winsomely bungled, broken stammering
and yet—and i’m as good a christian as gotthold—and yet …
i believe in progress, certainly
otherwise i couldn’t move a finger
landscapes, still lifes, animals—a fellow like me shrinks from absolutely nothing
and the pinches hurt, of course, so we would reluctantly supply the correct answer
he had a bulldog face and brown, apathetic eyes
old dr grabow appeared in person
the phrase saddled you with sounded particularly droll coming from him
sievert tiburtius and clara buddenbrook held back a little
but the moment he took hold of the white door’s burnt-gold handle, a storm of music surged up again and he shrank back
it is as if this loyalty may well have made up for my having fled in horror from my country's guilt
he had lost his self-control after all
well, my boy, have fun with it, he said, stroking hanno’s hair
he cried, his voice cracking
about like john the martyr in his cauldron of oil
he spoke quite extempore, distinctly, without effort or pause, inphrases tinged with light irony and as precise as the printed word-and not from a chair behind his lectern, but somewhere off to one side, half-sitting, halfleaning against a railing, the tips of his fingers lying interlaced in his lap with thumbs spread wide, while his small forked beard bobbed up and down, revealing the splinter-sharp teeth set between it and his tapered and twirled moustache
it comes to mind because kretzschmar-that was my teacher, an organist, a man of the fugue, you should know-had an oddly passionate regard for the piece, a true weakness
the good-natured martyr, what was he up to there?
she obviously enjoyed listening to his descriptions of life in travemünde and joined in enthusiastically whenever he wistfully sang its praises
herr naphta would rather impugn art than admit it could make a human being of even the worst reprobate
naphta was told to be silent on that account—first, because it was an outrage to humane feelings, and second, because he, settembrini, had heard enough evasions and could see through the tricks of his opponent’s apologetics to the thoroughly infamous and devilish cult of nihilism, which desired to be called spirit and managed to perceive something legitimizing and sanctifying in the acknowledged unpopularity of the ascetic principle
you aren’t even thinking of the actual state of affairs, thomas
life is short, whereas our ability to meet its challenges is but—those are facts, my child
i’ll go back to amsterdam and play duets with papa, and then later i’ll live with my married sister
besides, there is my cousin with whom i am involved and who has little or no inclination to amuse himself here; he thinks about nothing except returning to the plains to be a soldier
the cousins sat down on an unoccupied bench to watch and critique the play
that the decision would be rnade, i foresaw with some emotion, and the fact that it was already as good as made served as the basis for an ensuing conversation about both our immediate futures
hans castorp counted now
she lived in an inexpensive boardinghouse in dorf—nineteen years old, a slip of a thing, with smooth oily hair, eyes that shyly tried to hide a glint that matched the hectic flush of her cheeks, and a distinctively husky but sympathetic voice
i did not at all enjoy it when kjoejelund the concert singer would blast siegfried's endless and rather dull smithy songs, setting the salon's more sensitive pieces of decor, the vases and glass objets d'art, vibrating and humming excitedly along
without exchanging a word or a sign, joachim and hans castorp were in complete agreement about this little speech: they found it petulant and unsettlingly seditious—but entertaining as well, of course, indeed edifying in its brazen rebelliousness
if, for example, conversation turned to the history of the buddenbrooks, christian could become wrapped up in a mood of high seriousness—which ill became him—and speak with love and admiration of his hometown and his forebears
what is this i hear, my good engineer?
and yet it cannot be, nor has it ever been denied that the demonic and irrational have a disquieting share in that radiant sphere, that there is always a faint, sinister connection between it and the nether world, and for that very reason those reassuring epithets i sought to attribute to genius- noble, humanely healthy, and harmonious-do not quite fit, not even when (and it is rather painful for me to make this distinction) not
you could say that
i’m not going to make rules for you
then hans castorp stood there drawing figures on the asphalt with his cane
hans castorp labored to climb the steep stairs, helping himself with his hands at times; sighing heavily to relieve the growing pressure around his heart, he now reached the forest of columns
literally, the director said
you should call him that sometime, too, just as a joke
we all look forward to the moment when we may embrace you once again
yes, well, he said with a blush, i read it, too, as you can see, simply because there’s nothing else
it sits right here, sort of in your stomach—really quite curious
a delightful lady, of german heritage, married, a young mother
and tomorrow i’m going to see gieseke!
man is master of his fate
and what was an hour, spent for instance lying in rest cure or taking a walk after a meal—which more or less exhausted the possibilities for using up such a unit of time?
his relations with gerda buddenbrook, however, drove him to despair
such gushing in cries of absolutely noncommittal amazement was, by the way, also the technique this basically unpleasant man employed in any conversation that went beyond his own horizons as an artist and carnivalist, and he even used it for a while during the exchange i have in mind, which touched on issues of aesthetics and morality
i am tormented by the memory of how difficult it was to ring the custodian awake in his ground-floor apartment
on holiday afternoons, after partaking of cake and wine, he and his fellow students—in gray-and-green uniforms with stiff collars, striped trousers, and caps—went for a walk in closed formation
she fetched a pinch of salt from the dining hall and sprinkled it on prosecutor paravant’s head, then took him by the hand, led him to the piano, and held his forefinger to plunk out the beginning of twinkle, twinkle, little star
kesperlin being caspar, and thus caspar and samiel are one and the same
yes, yes, nature knows her leaf precisely, not just in its perfection, but with all its little everyday blemishes and defects, and she obligingly, mischievously repeats its external appearance in another realm, on the underside of the wings of this butterfly of hers, in order to delude her other creatures
a proper man, a gentleman,
there was as yet no consensus
i protest, settembrini cried, holding his teacup out at arm’s length toward his host
one should not deny the humanist his position as an educator—indeed it cannot be denied to him, for he alone preserves the tradition of man’s dignity and beauty
your letter duly received
she had always been in awe of his powerful position in the town, of his diligent, sober, stern, and pious competence, had felt more respect than tenderness for him, but during the stormy scene in her salon, he had shown her his human side; it had touched her and filled her with pride that he had found her worthy of a serious, confidential discussion of the matter, that he had put the decision in her hands, and that he, who had always been so unimpeachable, had admitted almost humbly that he did not feel guiltless in what had happened to her
she bent forward to toss the butt of her cigarette into the grate beside her, then sat back and crossed her arms
moreover, the league is engaged in founding popular universities, in working to overcome class struggle by every means of social improvement that commends itself for the purpose, and, finally, in eliminating conflict between nations, war itself, by fostering international law
but to a far greater extent than down below, there was something inappropriate about the jokes, something to do with chattering teeth and shortness of breath, something that marked such jokes all too clearly as transparent disguises for the anguish hidden beneath them, or rather for the anguish impossible to hide
a silent sister, then, is merely a column of mercury without a scale
that’s a bit much, i must say
to be sure, this refreshment of our sense of time extends beyond the interlude; its effect is noticeable again when we return to our daily routine
horrible, he said, visibly shuddering as he stood up
she grasped the hands of her grandson, johann, and her great-granddaughter, elisabeth, and strode across the room
i ask-and am i asking too much?
but she swore that she had been infected only temporarily, very slightly and superficially, for just a brief time as a young girl
shortly after his arrival, evidently feeling somewhat lonely and forlorn, he had in fact requested that i join him in halle, and although
he certainly felt that he was part of a different, more restricted society, was anything but a tourist; and his more recent, broadening perspective had brought with it attenuating duties and a dignity that distanced him from others, so that he was not of a mind to join them in their romps or to roll in the snow like a fool
i am glad to see you, even more than usual
and he saw giuseppe settembrini—the tricolor in one hand, a swinging saber in the other, black eyes turned heavenward to seal his vow—at the head of a troop of revolutionaries storming the phalanx of despotism
and as hans castorp thought about it, he closed his eyes tight and shook his head cautiously, which could just as easily have been taken as an expression of admiration for giuseppe settembrini as of dismay and rejection
which is a good thing, by the way—one can live with that
and women showed a general tendency to kneel beside nepomuk
time is what is real, the best we give, and our gift is the hour-glass-indeed
he sees things from a very peculiar angle, doesn’t he?
they had all pulled back in shock
and the young man laughed and looked again at tony’s plate—and blushed

not at all, lebrecht kröger replied sternly
hans castorp asked sternly
i never would have thought that i could fail so miserably at being some help to you, tom
illness and despair, settembrini said, are often only forms of depravity
indeed, inasmuch as these refinements are meant to intoxicate or excite us—are stimulants, as they say—they support and enhance the intensity of feelings, which means, then, that their purpose and goal are life itself, a love of feeling, are inadequacy’s way of striving for feeling
no, i’m not, tom
and my name is fairly frequent among their children, and your mama’s name, too
yes, just him, joachim said, obviously preoccupied
but music and speech, he insisted, belonged together, were ultimately one-language was music, music a language; when separated, each always stood in reference to the other, imitated the other, made use of the other's methods, always insinuated that it was the substitute for the other

ruses and only by stages, by way of the oddest transitions, arrive at the richest vocal music; choruses, that is, that move through all the shades of graduated whispering, antiphonal speech, and quasi-chant on up to the most polyphonic song-accompanied by sounds that begin as simple noise, as magical, fanatical african drums and booming gongs, only to attain the highest music
her dark eyes were inert; she seemed frozen with grief and the fear of god
hans castorp had been offended by joachim’s rather!—it had sounded so impertinent, or at least oddly indifferent under the circumstances
but from its outcome, which he now found displayed before him in the dining room, he gathered that his grandfather had now received solemn dispensation from his interim stage and had finally returned to the form appropriate to him—an event of which he could only approve, though old fiete wept and constantly shook his head, even though hans castorp himself wept, just as he had wept at the sight of his unexpectedly deceased mother and, a short time later, of his father lying there equally serene and strange
but for some reason, whether it was from an excess of delight or the pure love of hearing herself talk, tony stubbornly insisted that gerda had always hated her, whereas she, for her part—and her eyes would fill with tears—had always repaid that hate with love
and go his stiff-kneed way
but the events on the far side of the wall were even more audible from his room
afterward he spent a great deal of time in the leipzig library, copying out carissimi's ]ephta and schutz's psalms of david
i could not hide from myself my joy that his intentions would mean release from his elfin bond to schwerdtfeger, and indeed i was inclined to see them as a conscious means to accomplish that
thomas buddenbrook left his office and hurried up the stairs
you are, on the whole, an impertinent person, god knows why
shall i admit that i, very privately and apart from any historical aspect, felt deeply, intimately, personally ashamed of the fact?
for this was now the third time within so few months and at such a young age that little hans castorp’s mind and senses had been affected by death—his senses in particular
she had been accepted by the johannis cloister
that was not for him, he required sensible barometric pressure or he would have another attack
so i can have them right away!
it seems to me, however, that you should have told me about that before class, instead of waiting until i called on you
people were laughing as if they agreed with me
people thought that thomas buddenbrook looked, as they said, rather tumbledown
serves you right, hans castorp thought with distaste
he was gaunt and pale
he had a strange bumpy head and his blond hair was pasted to it like smooth, shiny glass; there were black rings around his gray eyes, and his long, brown hands stuck out from under coat sleeves that were too short but always brushed and spotless
julie möllendorpf, née hagenström, never greets me
what do you want to bet that our exotic on guard duty in there—who just happened to don his best for tonight—could tell us exactly what’s what?
he kept his eyelids lowered, so that his long, brown lashes fell across the bluish shadows around his eyes, and he held his tight-closed lips a little askew

it sucked hungrily at its last sweet drops with almost cynical despair, with a deliberate willing of bliss and doom, and it fell away in exhaustion, revulsion, and surfeit, until finally, finally, in the languor that followed, all its excesses trickled off in a long, soft arpeggio in the minor, modulated up one key, resolved to the major, hesitated, and died a wistful death
fräulein severin,  i say, i want the keys
i scarcely need mention that the beginnings of the developments mentioned here were very remote {rom adrian; he paid them hardly any notice and was directed toward them to some extent only by me, whose inherent social curiosity-or should i say, human sympathy-was greater than his
anyone who would claim that such scruples are detrimental to love surely understands absolutely nothing about love
he’s a tall, broad-shouldered man, to be sure, and likes to stand with his legs set wide apart, his hands buried in his trouser pockets—i couldn’t help noticing they’re sewn in vertically, instead of on the slant the way yours and mine are, the way pockets generally are in the better classes
now, justus is a very charming fellow, but not exactly a good businessman, and he has also had some setbacks that were not his fault
so then, fine, i’ll accept your term
it slid down now with a low rumble
next to him on a chair was a tray with coffee things and on his nightstand, amid glasses of medicine, was a half-empty bottle of wine—the simple, sparkling swiss red of the night before
and thomas, who was well versed in such tasks, ran off and returned with two very dusty and cobwebbed bottles
across the way, a little distance up the hill, was the walled cemetery of davos-dorf—and joachim pointed it out as well with his walking stick
the other way round: the special occurrence assumes an air as if it were identical with the preexisting, familiar formula
one can imagine my amazement!
frau permaneder paid extraordinarily close attention, and the moment any doubt arose as to the future owner of a given object, she would say in her inimitable fashion, well, i’d be willing to take it, and look as if the whole world should thank her for such self-sacrifice
a few days later, after a stay of three weeks, we had to extricate ourselves again and begin the trip home to germany, while for several months, well into autumn, they remained faithful to the idyllic regularity of their existence, with its cloister garden, family table, campagna rimmed with sleek gold, stony living room, and evenings of reading by lamplight
he fell silent and a restless, earnest look passed over his face; he rubbed his hand across his bald head and then down his whole left side
i like to think back to the chaldeans when i’m lying there watching the planets, the ones they already knew about, because they didn’t know them all, clever as they were
there was a new sport, hans castorp learned, an invention from the north called skijoring, a race in which contestants on skis were pulled by horses
a few stout maids and even a waiter in a greasy frock coat were marching at high speed across the lawn, bearing cold plates, lemonade, milk, and beer up to the tables, several of which were already occupied by scattered families with their children
even naphta let it be known through his second, wehsal, that this was his opinion, too—and hans castorp said all right
at this point she offered her guests coffee and pound cake, but schildknapp and adrian said that they would rather use the time left them to have a look at the house and courtyard, if she would be so kind as to show them
for inventing melodic lines whose notes could be set one above the other and, when played simultaneously, folded up into complicated harmonies-and, vice versa, of establishing chords made up of many notes that could be spread out horizontally into melodies
it was very good and, despite a threadbare outfit that his finances dictated always remain the same, he looked the elegant and sporty gentleman
i repeat: how could one possibly manage without it?
if abdul hamid falls, that’s the end of your influence in turkey, and england will set itself up as protector
its work is terror, that the world may be saved and the ultimate goal of redemption be achieved: the children of god living in a world without classes or laws
for god's sake, what's the problem?
october began as new months are wont to do—their beginnings are perfectly modest and hushed, with no outward signs, no birthmarks
but here he was again now!
i’m standing here with my eyes closed and feeling pleasantly drowsy
or just one or two trunks?
what made you be so malicious?
oh, fine, tony said, now what has she smashed to smithereens?
the cousins had arisen earlier than usual in order to honor the morning by extending their constitutional a little beyond its normal limits and continuing along the forest path beyond the bench beside the water trough
he was alone, and as he lay there quietly enjoying the beneficial effects of the bicarbonate, he closed his eyes and saw again the dining room full of gifts, glowing in all its brilliance
and so all our measurements are merely conventions, if you please
perhaps she would follow the path laid out for her and marry herr grünlich, she didn’t care one way or the other
we italians followed his example
i had left him behind then within the familiar framework of
and kai knew he would have felt exactly the same in hanno’s shoes
the a, which demands a resolution to g-sharp, yielding the modulation from b major to a major, led him on until he came by way of a, d, and g major, to c major, and from there into the flatted keys, thus demonstrating for me that one can build a major or minor scale by using any of the twelve tones of the chromatic scale
not when i’m ordered to do so, settembrini replied
no doubt of it—thomas buddenbrook’s existence was no different from that of an actor, but one whose whole life has become a single production, down to the smallest, most workaday detail—a production that, apart from a few brief hours each day, constantly engaged and devoured all his energies
music, nature, and cheerful devotion, those were closely related and prescribed ideas in the winfried fraternity, and when i spoke of the sons of the muses, the phrase, which to some perhaps might not seem to apply to theology students, had its justification in that combination of attitudes, in that spirit of unconstrained piety and bright-eyed regard for the beautiful that likewise characterized our hikes into nature-and i now return to them
to which was added, as noted, practical reasons having to do with my own studies
two ladies from the lower common lounging area, frau redisch, the wife of a polish industrialist, and a certain widow hessenfeld from berlin, both of them recent october arrivals, became involved in a rather unedifying scene after supper; indeed they came to blows and one of them began screaming hysterically (it might have been redisch, but could just as easily have been hessenfeld), and finally, simply sick with rage, had to be taken to her room—all because each claimed she was first in line for the book
she was even on friendly, indeed intimate footing with frau knoterich, natalia of the exotically spanish look, despite the fact that it was reputed (and probably rightly so) that this quite charming woman was addicted to morphine-a rumor confirmed by personal observation of her engaging, bright-eyed volubility at the beginning of a party and occasional disappearances to refresh her gradually waning high spirits
far more useful, rather, were irony, mockery, which cleared the air by opposing romanticism, pathos, and prophecy, and joining literature and the intoxication of sound in a common front with what is objective and elemental-which is to say, with the rediscovery of music itself as organization of time
besides, hans castorp said, if i had spoken to you before this, i would have had to use the formal pronoun
there are thermometers for sale here everywhere, in almost any shop
are you cured, then?
a party of guests of both sexes was coming toward him—he had noticed them moving along a level stretch of path about halfway up the slope, and now they were tramping downhill, moving directly toward him, and he could hear the babble of voices
he is the very feeling of god
and when the poor, dear child tumbles to his ruin, she takes him back to her bosom, forgiving him everything and with no other thought than that he would have done better never to have left
do you believe religiosity is a peculiarly german talent?
in the evening he would study the stars
borne upon pinions, we bombarded many more villages
he was constantly improving his knowledge of languages; recently, purely for scientific purposes and without any practical effect, he had attempted to learn chinese—had worked very diligently at it for two weeks
nothing—nothing he could put a name to
the rich lilac of her gown matched her heavy, dark chestnut hair in some very odd way and made her lusterless complexion look paler than ever; even the bluish shadows seemed deeper and darker in the corners of her close-set brown eyes
this attribute definitely demanded, to god's glory, that it be put into practice and could not have been revealed had god not consigned his creature to sin
otherwise one quickly finds oneself regarded as an unhappy loner and is held in less esteem
as he ascended the stairs his eyes bounced shyly in all directions, looking for his boss, and when he at last discovered him at the far end of the staircase, he worked his way back through the obstructing crowd, muttering hasty apologies as he went
wehsal had set his jaw askew
all too soon, he had grown quiet again, perhaps quieter than before
we have no more business to discuss, really, i am as good as on my way, have the doorknob in hand-we have been on our feet for a while now, and still i prattle on merely pour prendre conge
do not presume that you can conceive of much of anything on your own, but rather attempt to receive and ponder
yes, the last few days have been exhausting
his pink face was incapable of turning totally pale
management was on the ground floor: after crossing the lobby and following the hallway past the cloakroom, kitchen, and housekeeping, you could not miss it, especially given the porcelain sign on the door
you bother me, he heard himself saying quite clearly
the courage of self-recognition and expression—that is literature, that is humanity
pulling aside the portieres, she entered from the living room and gently bade frau iwersen to come nearer—and only then did she risk moving out a little farther across the parquet floor
along with the results of the director’s examination, this meant that honor-loving joachim would have to stay with his little extra therapy before he could rush off to the colors again
ah, it is probably more than a mere question that for that very reason this defeated nation now stands wild-eyed before the abyss, because its final and most extreme attempt to find its own political form is perishing in such ghastly failure
he was not interested in escapades, he would proceed in moderation
and a great deal more happens yet before it comes to an end
and it probably wasn’t in fact, because it left his head feeling just as hot as before, as if he were sitting in an overheated room or had drunk too much wine
yet it makes a good point, for it indicates an elevation of state that both music and musicians owe to romanticism
the band of poor, who had always gathered on meng strasse to receive shoes and woolens, was missing, and there were no carols by choirboys
it sealed his doom—he would be held back at easter
hans castorp stood there piously for a while, using the time to take in the situation, hesitating to change his pose, waiting for the widow to address him
but her little brown eyes were as loyal, bright, and alert as ever
he knew only one, dreadfully tedious topic of conversation: the ratio pi, that forlorn fraction, which a lesser genius of mental arithmetic named zacharias dase had once worked out to two hundred decimal places—a superfluous task, since even at two thousand places he would have had no greater prospect of approaching unattainable accuracy, indeed would not have been one whit closer to it
he sat there with his mouth closed, his hands folded in his lap, one check-trousered leg crossed over the other, and he gazed sternly at his foot swinging gently in the air
she sat bent over, almost drawn up into a crouch, and didn’t even notice when a warm drop fell on her hands, lying limp in her lap
good lord, the dregs!
someone tell me—am i hearing right?
that little limping devil up front already handed me my paltry correspondence, settembrini said, shoving a hand down into the side pocket of his ineluctable petersham coat
declared it spontaneously to his parents at buche!, whose reaction was even more favorable, and he had already informed me some time before, though implying that he saw these studies not as a preparation for practical pastoral service in the church, but for an academic career
adieu, my carnival prince!
but with this final and conclusive action by the consul, herr kesselmeyer’s good cheer returned—indeed, it grew more intense and dreadful, until it burst all bounds
meme pour un homme gate, endurci comme moi, c'est toujours une experience touchante de rencontrer un grand homme-enchante, monsieur le professeur,  he added in passing and, since adrian had introduced me, casually offered me his hand, only to turn immediately back to the proper party
unfortunately, it does indeed look as if things are about to take this or that course
and i mention it now, thomas, as you can well hear, because i plan to marry her
the day after the celebrissimo’s arrival, the patient had died
i am deeply obliged to you, madame buddenbrook, he said, his expression underscoring how touched he was
there was a sudden surge in the tumult outside—the revolution had reached the windows of the assembly hall
the harbor pilot entered his office with the bearing of a man satisfied with the hearty lunch he has just eaten
a little squab, a little french bread …
but one can always pull oneself together again
the director himself hardly bothers to conceal the fact, not even for appearance’ sake
leipzig, which plays such a significant role in leverkiihn's evolution, in the tragedy of his life, has recently borne the full impact: its famous publishing district is, i sadly hear, only a heap of rubble and an immeasurable wealth of literary and educational material is now the spoil of destruction-a heavy loss not only for us germans, but also for a whole world that cares about culture
when he did appear in pfeiffering, for he came by now and again all the same, he would wear a flannel body wrap, and sometimes even a moist throat compress wrapped in gutta-percha-a source of bitter comedy and anglo-saxon jokes for him and of amusement for adrian, who could rise above his physical torments to find liberation in jests and laughter with no one else so well as with riidiger
an embroidered green runner ran across the snow-white cloth of woven damask spread over the round table, which was set with gold-rimmed porcelain of such transparency that here and there it shimmered like mother-of-pearl
isn’t it rather shabby of us to speak about him this way?
only a very few people had paid attention to his meddling, but frau chauchat had felt the benefit at once and turned around—and held that pose until hans castorp had reached his chair again
but behrens would probably make an exception and give you permission if you made it a point to ask
there were blizzards that prevented you from staying out on the balcony, when the wind drove great masses of white before it, covering the floor, furniture, everything, with a thick layer of snow
mirth cannot move a soul in agony
the soft red glow of winter twilight shone through the window and fell on the muddy clothes draped over a chair in one corner of the room
moreover, she declared her outrage that the boss was not sitting at their table again today
is it not like a cleansing bath for the soul?
he asked as they descended the stairs
also in the room, besides frau schweigestill who was constantly moving to and fro, was frizzy-haired kunigunde rosenstiel, who, on one of the visits allowed her, had made the boy's acquaintance and passionately taken him to her melancholy heart
you are sure to be thinking that what i have in mind is your fierce discipline, et que vous enchainez votre art dans un systeme de regles inexorables et neoclassiques, that you force your art to move in those iron chains-if not with grace, then with intelligence and boldness
but no matter—all the better!
was it because he had turned the air blue and she did not really believe him—or that she did believe him, as she surely must, but found the state of hovering between life and death too funny for words?
or, you will find out soon enough as always, my good man!
he would have to be content with 'german,  with  wouldeutsch'-and would be giving himself a jewish name, oh, ia, ia!
whatever has stature cannot be called vice
i am a free man—i am my own master
and we old folks are heartless scoffers
i’m often embarrassed for him here—yes, i’ll admit it openly to you, ida

the latest achievement, children, top-notch, a-, nothing better in the warehouse
she cried, returning home from a walk with a red face and tossing her hat on the sofa in the landscape room
it was quite consistent with her viewpoint for her to say that her suitor was wrong about this and every similar question
tom pulled one of her hands away and took it in his own
madame buddenbrook had gone out, and tony was sitting alone, reading, at the window in the landscape room, when anton presented her with a calling card
you arrived at the last moment, joachim said
not in vain does he wink so audaciously and craftly with his eyes, and not in vain does inez rodde call him an underhand sneak
facing the door were two rows of soldiers, rifles resting at their sides; lieutenant von throta stood at the head of the company, his drawn sword held in his arm, his glowing eyes fixed on the bay window upstairs
is  areally' not what works, and truth not experience and feeling?
as long as one spoke of living entities, any discussion of elemental units was dishonest, because the concept of an entity carried with it, ad infinitum, the concept of the subordinate, organizing unit
just right, hans castorp thought, not one word too many, and yet it takes care of things for a while, no matter what
she raised her arms, let them fall again, and then slid to her knees beside her mother, hiding her head in the folds of the old woman’s skirt and sobbing bitterly
he was an exotic and attractive character among the bourgeois inhabitants of the old commercial town
no, permit me to say it—weak
in freising it meant that my senior students' faces were flushed, their eyes beaming
fourteen days had passed, and hanno told himself and anyone else who would listen that there was still plenty of time left, as much time as the holidays at michaelmas
i mean … and he grew quite agitated trying to express himself, to explain
hans castorp cried, availing himself in his eagerness of herr settembrini’s favorite expression of approval
he held the instrument close to his eyes, turned it back and forth—and could make out nothing
he pulled on his thick wool winter coat, donned his hat, grabbed his satchel, blew out the candle, stormed downstairs to the ground floor, and, passing the stuffed bear, turned right to enter the dining room
but come on, let’s have a look at your room, and you can wash up
nature all spookily scattered about, with the sweet purity of the last,
but you look so flushed that i’m afraid we’ve seen the end of your lowered temperature
and so kretzschmar lived in the selfevident, unuttered conviction that music had found its ultimate, highest manifestation and efficacy in orchestral works-something adrian no longer believed
this was the word he used, not explicitly, not by forming the syllables in his mind, but as something he felt in its most comprehensive sense, in the sense in which he had learned to understand it during his stay here—though that was a sense that had little to do with the meaning settembrini attached to the word
they were led back from their aberrations to reason, usefulness, and progress, to the battle against prince and priest—in short, to social happiness
yes, like him—or not quite like him, either
the entire work had been denounced as murky to the point of unpalatability, and for at least twenty bars, they had claimed, such scandalous confusion reigned-primarily the result of excessively colored modulations-that after that one could calmly close the file on the man's incompetence in this strict style
and if you had picked up on it, i would have been very proud to have been the middleman, because you know it’s always been my dream, my fondest hope, to be of some use to the family name
foul, rancid sin i did prefer,
but all the same, he took the elevator up with joachim and several other patients
so far so good, kretzschmar said
when she finished, she let the newspaper sink to her lap and leaned back to gaze at her brother and sister-in-law with uncomprehending, mournful eyes
in the next second, she flung her arms wide, and then—so abruptly, so instantaneously that both what she had heard and her answer seemed almost simultaneous—she cried out in the most absolute obedience, with boundless, fearful, loving submission and surrender, here i am!
if he had been able to believe at the foundations of his soul (there where he himself did not know what was what) that work has unconditional value, is a principle that answers its own question, might not both body and mind—first his mind, and through it, his body—have been more amenable to work and exhibited more stamina?
thomas shouted, stopping in his tracks and crossing his arms on his chest
after having been treated by joachim so coolly—indeed, hans castorp sensed something of a gentle hostility in good joachim’s attitude toward their fellow patient, a hostility that made him smile despite his own inner turmoil—clavdia tried pacing the room; but there was not enough space for that, and so she, too, picked up a magazine from the table and returned to her round chair with its rudimentary arms
we would have liked to say that the hot and very tasty coffee warmed our five friends and gave rise to elevated conversation
i’ll go up to her
but since all reactions and reflexes, by their very nature, serve some purpose, we physiologists are almost forced to conclude that such secondary phenomena due to psychological factors are actually meant to protect the body, are defense mechanisms, much like goose bumps
i mean—what about the house?
had his mind been less muddled, he would have had to admit that in terms of getting back home this was perhaps the worst thing he could have done; and indeed he told himself as much after he had taken a few sips, which produced an immediate effect, much the same effect as that caused by kulmbach beer his first evening up here, when with a lot of loose, disreputable talk about fish sauces and the like he had offended settembrini—herr lodovico, the pedagogue, who could keep madmen from letting themselves go, return them to reason with just a glance, and whose melodious little horn hans castorp now heard in the air around him, the signal that his oratorical teacher was now approaching at a forced march to free his troublesome pupil, life’s problem child, from his mad situation and lead him home
the conductor had motioned for the orchestra to rise so that along with him it could receive the audience's thanks for their beautiful work
it was most assuredly what people called a coup, wasn’t it?
oh, i worry constantly that the climate there may be bad for him
she asked coquettishly; and her fiery femininity triumphed over the eczema covering half her face
good lord, it was all just as it had been before
indeed, the question of his life, his very being and becoming, ultimately interested me more than that of my own, which was simple enough, requiring me to give it little thought, but merely to work diligently to create conditions for its predetermined solution
for a long time i didn’t think it possible i would ever find the right woman
for its own sweet, simple sake, we must totally and fully—oh, and with our highest and most perceptive—settled, ladies and gentlemen!

they all stood together on the gravel path in front of the huge grave cover with the family crest chiseled into the stone and surrounded by the names of those who rested there; rising behind it was a marble cross silhouetted against the little woods, leafless now in winter
but on all sides there were people willing to help him get through them; the general regard in which his orderly demeanor was held manifested itself in visits from near and far
free notes would no longer exist
please, have a seat
i would suggest you consult a doctor
it was, rather, that all these effects could be traced to the influence of one masterful nature among those present, to the personality among them, to mynheer peeperkorn, who held the reins in his grandly gesticulating hands and bound them all to the spell of the hour with the drama of his countenance, with pale eyes gazing out from under the monumental creases of his brow, with words and compelling pantomime
and to express this one, if we must, the only thing to say, as bluntly as possible, is that pieter peeperkorn—with his regal mask, his high, creased brow, his poignantly ragged lips—was both at the same time
and in the environs where we now find ourselves, such would be the case even less than elsewhere
then she fell silent for a moment and let her arms drop; her mouth widened, her chin puckered up and began to quiver, and as two large tears welled up under her lowered eyelashes, she added very softly, what about me?
lebrecht kröger took charge of the carving
there were certificates of citizenship, with the crest and seal of the free hanseatic city, insurance policies, poems of congratulation, and requests to serve as a godparent
he then spread out the contents of the basket on a tablecloth laid at their feet: a coffee service and glasses, thermos bottles, pastries, and wine
i am by now the only one who still preserves it!
a difference in temperament, herr settembrini
and that is over
the veiled lady should have known all along
the visit we have described here was the cousins’ first with naphta
it was eleven-thirty now; all the hotel guests must already have gone to the beach
do you care to recall the incident?
his long lashes could not hide the bluish shadows brooding in the corners of his eyes
when i think that you’ve had the privilege of living your life here all these years …
and when father leverkiihn would ask us what we thought they were, and we hesitantly answered that
they walked along the rows of tables, the director dispensing a casual, witty remark to almost everyone, so that a wake of mirth rippled behind him
thank god, because that meant hanno was probably safe now
people usually judged him wrongly-he would much rather have a serious, elevating, and beneficial conversation with a man like that than to be lying next to some woman
ah, so here you are—well, speak up and answer me!
monk, the venerable bede, a work in which a goodly portion of celtic fantasies about the next world and the visionary experiences from the early years of irish and anglo-saxon christianity have been handed down
we, too, would often accompany them up to this rather haphazard garden of spice-laden shade set within a crumbling wall and discreetly leaving them to their work, spend the increasingly hot morning to ourselves behind a screen of oleander, laurel, and broom, invisible to them both, just as they were invisible to one another-helene with her crocheting and i with a book, content and alertly mindful that nearby adrian was making progress on his opera
would return to kaisersaschern, the young student of divine sciences saw his high-school musical mentor, visited him, and conferred with him in the organist's apartment near the cathedral, saw him at his uncle leverkiihn's home as well, and once or twice prevailed on his parents to invite him for a weekend at buche!
why are you standing there?
they’ll be quiet this evening, at least i certainly expect them to be
in its never-resting concern for its guests, a thoughtful management had decided to add another amusing gadget to the collection in the main social room—purchased at a price we do not care to estimate, but that must have been considerable, a handsome disbursement on the part of the administration of this highly recommended institution
let me try to describe it precisely
so let us go inside, he declared and took nepomuk's hand again to lead him
all those other ingredients are not very stable without life
his gray hair was combed down over his brow for sinister effect
he spoke with the consul about business and politics, propounding some very serious and germane principles; he chatted with the consul’s wife about fashions, balls, and the theater; he had kind words for tom, christian, and poor klothilde, even for little clara and mamselle jungmann
and here’s our afternoon snack—
the young people said their good-byes, likewise expressing their thanks, and were in turn encouraged to come again
i intend to hold that principle sacred to the end of my days, although now and then one may entertain doubts when confronted with people who apparently have better success without such principles
i can predict that you’ll see a nasty rise in your fever chart this evening
just look where such impudence got you!
a ia bonne heure
might i presume to inquire as to the state of your health?
good ash—what brand of lovely brunette is she?
it is an organ that merely wards off danger, sends up signals, though it does keep a damned good eye out for anything that gets too near the body
yes, yes, they would probably have to fight; that way matters might at least be salvaged by chivalrous rules that moderated the primal state

i’ll just wait for my d’gods’ comrade, he’ll be here any moment, since it’s already half past three, i notice
