as we go under the portal you can also explain to me the meaning of that painted gardener that you see as you go into the church
in the fifteenth century the seine washed five islands within the walls of paris: the îie louviers, where there were then trees and now only timber; the île-aux-vaches and the îie notre-dame, both deserted, apart from one hovel, both fiefs of the bishop (in the seventeenth century these two islands were made into one, which was then built upon and is now called the îie saint-louis); finally the îie de la cité, the city, with at its tip the cow-ferryman’s islet, since buried beneath the esplanade of the pont-neuf

the greeks tried to quibble about the different kinds of money

his merit, his learning, his position as immediate vassal of the bishop of paris, opened wide for him the gates of the church

we’ve all seen that there are two of you
the streets meanwhile were with every moment becoming darker and lonelier

they did not even try to run away
compère coictier stayed dumb with surprise
the ligurians encamped on the mappalia surrounded his house

the reader may perhaps not have forgotten that part of the court of miracles was enclosed by the ancient town wall, a good number of whose towers were beginning at that time to fall into ruin
jehan bowed low to him, and went back down the cloister stairs whistling
with bronze winnowing fans the temple slaves took up the ashes which had fallen on the edge of the slab; and they threw them in the air, so that the sacrifice should be sprinkled over the town and up to the region of the stars
at length the king looked at him
meanwhile the three damoiselles (for the title dame was at that time reserved for noblewomen) were all talking at once
the creaking of the water wheels bringing water to the top floor of the palaces was no longer audible and in the middle of the terraces camels rested quietly, lying on their bellies as ostriches do

the same law that you apply to truands, the truands apply to you
he sometimes lectured jehan severely and at length on the subject, and this was endured undaunted
occasionally a half-burned bit of wall stood at the side of the road
what have you come here for?
each face, each stone of the venerable monument is a page not only of the history of france, but also of the history of science and art
it’s a miracle,  put in henriette la gaultière
yet that’s simple enough!
the other end contained the chapel where louis xi had had himself sculptured kneeling before the virgin, and to which he had transferred, heedless of the two niches left empty in the row of royal statues, those of charlemagne and st louis, two saints who, he supposed, must enjoy much favour in heaven as kings of france
at that the elders decreed the execution of the captives, although the suffete had written that they should not be put to death
at each wicket, they all had to bow their heads, except the old man, bent with age
then the leaders demanded from all the barbarians an oath of complete obedience
quasimodo then took up the rearguard, and followed the archdeacon walking backwards, squat, snarling, monstrous, bristling, flexing his limbs, licking his boar-like tusks, growling like a wild beast, and sending huge ripples through the crowd with a mere look or gesture
she stuck two skeletal arms out of her cell, and cried out in a voice like a death-rattle: so it’s you, daughter of egypt!
taanach started back with surprise, and in order to know more about it said:
next they thought of gisco
and that wild boar in front of them?
everyone wanted to contribute
even to the ferryman’s!
there were, too, some fine buildings breaking through the petrified waves of this sea of gables
the next two days were spent paying the men from magdala, leptis, hecatompylus; spendius did the rounds of the gauls
a man rushed to the corpse
however, the door stood firm: devil take it!
by the way,  gringoire added, looking at the archdeacon, half mockingly, you still think of her, then?
clemency carries the torch ahead of all the other virtues
they were for all that a people, and he was their sovereign
in the first place, the streets, intersecting and tangled, formed numerous diverting patterns in the mass
and her tone had something both thoughtful and passionate about it
he recalled the violent scene of which he had caught just a glimpse, the gypsy girl struggling with two men, the fact that quasimodo had had a companion, and the grim, haughty face of the archdeacon passed vaguely through his memory
fortunately the street was dark, and the student drunk
just now, while you were speaking, your breath passed over my face, and i was as delighted as a dying man lying drinking at the side of a stream
and when you observe that this form of expression is not only the best for conservation, but also the simplest, the most convenient, the most universally available; when you think that it is not encumbered by baggage and requires the moving of no heavy apparatus; when you compare the way thought, before it can be translated into a building, has to set in motion four or five other arts and tons of gold, a whole mountain of stone, a whole forest of timber, a whole people of workmen; when you compare it with thought becoming a book, needing only a little paper, a little ink, and a pen, how can anyone be surprised if human intelligence has forsaken architecture for printing?
the unexpected sight of novel foods aroused their greed
their ramparts, kept ruined through carthaginian jealousy, were so weak that they would fall down at a push from someone’s shoulder
now, with la esmeralda dead, the sponge was saturated
then behind the numidians, the maurusians, and the gaetulians pressed the yellow men who lived beyond taggir in cedar forests
cut the knaves to pieces!
when he heard the abbot’s men-at-arms crying out their challenges around the crenellated circumvallation of saint-germain, he turned aside, took a path he found between the abbey mill and the leper house of the village, and after a few moments found himself on the edge of the pré-aux-clercs
was it a confession?
god help me, gentlemen!
note that, compère olivier
to the centuries and revolutions, which at least devastated impartially and on the grand scale, has been added the swarm of architects from the schools, licensed, sworn, and accredited, degrading with all the discernment and choice of bad taste, substituting louis xv chicory for gothic lace to the greater glory of the parthenon

their companions, in terror, left the place
the barbarians did not need any encircling ramparts on the side towards africa: that belonged to them

bohemian girl, on such a day as may please our lord the king, at the hour of noon, you will be taken in a tumbril, wearing a shift, barefoot, a rope round your neck, before the great portal of notre-dame, and there you will do public penance with a wax torch of two pounds’ weight in your hand, thence you will be taken to the place de grève, where you will be hanged and strangled on the town gibbet; likewise your goat; and you will pay the official number lions of gold in reparation for the crimes committed and confessed by you of witchcraft, magic, lechery, and murder against the person of monsieur phoebus de châteaupers
right,  said gringoire, i understand that much
just as her eyes closed, when all feeling was drifting away, she thought she felt a fiery touch imprinted on her lips, a kiss more searing than the executioner’s red-hot iron
he turned his right foot round his left leg, stood on tiptoe on his left foot, and stretched out his arm; but just as he touched the dummy, his body, now balanced only on one foot, swayed on the stool which had only three; he tried automatically to steady himself on the dummy, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibrations of the hundreds of bells on the dummy, which, under the impulse from his hand, first turned on its own axis, and then swung majestically between the two posts
then the africans demanded corn, according to the grand council’s undertakings
my plan had frightening aspects which held me back
let’s not disturb her
we are observing silence like so many pythagoreans or fish!
for three days they stuffed themselves
in the middle of the night gusts of wind blew up
i won’t tell you, poor old man that you are, to go and visit the burial chambers of the pyramids, of which ancient herodotus speaks, nor the brick tower of babel, nor the immense white marble sanctuary of the indian temple of eklinga
he had fallen to his knees and gazed longingly at her with blazing eyes
the soldiers were almost the only ones to leave
they had crossed the desert, drinking from brackish wells constructed with camel bones; the zuaeces, covered in ostrich feathers, had come on quadrigas; the garamantes, masked with black veils, sitting well back on their painted mares; others on donkeys, wild asses, zebras, buffaloes; and some dragged along their families and their idols as well as the boat-shaped roofs of their huts
they have pillaged everything!
the same jealousy that a husband feels for his wife’s honour, a son’s appreciation of his father’s love, a good vassal must feel for the glory -of his king, he must drain himself dry in zeal for his house, in the increase of his service
start at once,  the other went on
at the hour appointed spendius found mâtho there
so the romanesque abbey, the philosophical church, gothic art, saxon art, the heavy round pillar recalling gregory vii, the hermetic symbolism which made nicolas flamel the precursor of luther, papal unity, schism, saint-germain-des-prés, saint-jacques-de-la-boucherie, everything is merged, combined, amalgamated in notre-dame
soon at the edge of the stockades there rose two crossed standards, the accepted sign for requesting corpses
that’s a good sentence!
his body is already all broken
i have the hammer and the nail, and those implements are no more fearsome in my hands than a mallet in the hands of a cutler—yet all that is needed is to find the magic word that ezekiel pronounced when he hit the nail
raucous cries came out of their bushy beards; their torn coats of mail beat against their sword-hilts, and through the holes in the bronze could be seen their naked members, as fearful as weapons of war
but spendius reassured them
while daedalus, who is strength, took measurements, while orpheus, who is intelligence, sang, the pillar, which is a letter, the arcade, which is a syllable, the pyramid, which is a word, set in motion at once by a geometrical and a poetic law, were grouping, combining, blending, rising, descending, lying in juxtaposition on the ground, rising in tiers into the sky, until they had written at the dictation of the general idea of an epoch those wonderful books which were also wonderful buildings: the pagodas of eklinga, the ramesseum of egypt, the temple of solomon
he huddled against his chest, like a child frightened by a ghost
it’s the archdeacon of josas,  said fleur-de-lys
several times above the crowd, they exchanged insults, which went unheard
try taking a bone away from a tiger!
and without any signal or word of command the soldiers from utica and those from the bridge ran pell-mell in a combined attack on hamilcar
and the proctors’ sideboards!
at that the student said, looking at once grave and resolute: all right, brother, i’m sorry to have to tell you that i have received from other quarters some very handsome offers and proposals
that’s enough, sire,  tristan answered
he was obliged to sit down, so intense was his shock
he went on, come here!
while he still paid her occasional visits, from some remnant of human respect, he felt doubly uncomfortable with fleur-de-lys; first, because as a result of scattering his affections in all sorts of places he had kept back very little for her; then because in the midst of so many stiff, starched, and proper lovely ladies he went in constant fear lest his mouth, so accustomed to bad language, might suddenly take the bit between its teeth and run off into the language of the tavern
in paris there were quite a number of such cells for praying to god and doing penance; almost all were occupied
the victim was fastened on to this wheel, kneeling, with his arms behind his back
you, your shadow, the image of the luminous apparition which had one day crossed the space before me
hamilcar’s daughter no longer extended her fasts with such fervour
she’s the recluse in the rat-hole
after the kingdom of the argoteers came the empire of galilee
and his hand went to the hilt of his dagger
it is a boar!
the two distinct crowds mingled without becoming confused, the one dressed in linen or wool with felt caps like pine cones, and the other dressed in armour and helmeted
first came a buzzing in the ears, nails went black, the chest went cold, they lay on their side and expired without a cry
tristan cast a sidelong look at the recluse
the whistle he had given her she had left lying on the ground
i was full of religion for love of her; and i saw you through her smile as though through an opening in the heavens—oh!
then tight lipped he crouched back on the cushions; he tore the fringes with his nails, breathing heavily, with staring eyes
the fugitives reappeared one by one, like shadows; the women too risked returning, for there still remained some, especially with the libyans, despite the appalling massacre committed by the numidians
sweat ran down his chest, between the squareness of his muscles; and his breathing shook his sides with the bronze belt set with leather thongs which hung down to his knees, more solid than marble
and then he laughed again, at the thought that phoebus was still alive, that after all the captain was living, was merry and contented, had finer actons than ever, and a new mistress whom he was taking to see the old one hang
hamilcar stepped over him
thirty stalwart fellows, square-limbed, with the look of locksmiths, stepped out from the ranks with hammers, pincers, and iron bars on their shoulders
he added: be my son and defend your father!
however, at intervals her blue lips parted in a breath, and quivered, but as lifelessly and mechanically as leaves shifting in the wind
gringoire was extremely put out
it was the formidable figure of quasimodo
perhaps she is there among them!
come on, you’ll be second up
the entire human race is on the scaffolding
what does it matter after all?
all his men together gave a great shout, and mâtho, carried away by this anger, cried that he accepted the alliance
her hands were untied, she was made to get down, accompanied by her goat, which had been also untied and was bleating with joy at feeling free, and they made her walk barefoot over the hard pavement to the foot of the steps of the portal
this was, however, the sole human contact remaining to her—the gaoler’s periodic visit
on the terrace of the temple of khamon gigantic pieces of gold plate weighed down three long tables at which the priests, the elders, and the rich would sit, and there was a fourth one, for hamilcar, narr’havas, and her; for, as salammbo had saved the fatherland by recovering the veil, the people were making her marriage into a day of national rejoicing, and below, in the square, waited for her to appear
the pretty pink feet especially never ceased to amaze her and send her into transports of delight!
carians proudly tossed their helmet plumes, cappadocian archers had painted great flowers on their bodies with herbal juices, and some lydians in woman’s dress wore slippers and earrings as they dined
forgive me, mademoiselle,  gringoire said with a smile, but why did you take me for a husband?
by the way, master,  gringoire suddenly went on, as we came out on to the parvis through those crazy truands, did your reverence notice the poor little devil whose brains your deaf man was busy dashing out against the balustrade of the gallery of kings?
it was narr’havas who had been following him for some time, step by step, with one of those large nets used for catching wild beasts, and profiting from the moment he was bending down, had thrown it over him
the newcomer took another step forward: jupiter!
whom do you have to thank for breathing this air, seeing that sky, and being still able to amuse your lark’s brain with frivolities and follies?
she was not much concerned about that
where’s bellevigne de l’étoile?
so they do not answer!
the wavering, feeble illumination from the fires enabled gringoire to make out, confused as he was, all round the vast square a hideous frame of old houses, whose rotten, shrivelled, stunted façades, each pierced by one or two lighted attic windows, looked to him in the darkness like the heads of old women, standing in a circle, monstrous and baleful, watching the witches’ sabbath with blinking eyes
it was a redoubt, circular in shape, carpeted with mats of gleaming straw, the ceiling beams embellished with fleurs-de-lys of gilded tin and the space in between painted, panelled with ornate woodwork sprinkled with rosettes of white tin, and painted a beautiful bright green, made of orpiment and fine indigo
the old church, all vibrating and resonant, lived in a perpetual rejoicing of bells
we must make a bonfire this evening in the champ-gaillard,  the other continued, with maître andry’s books
the dummy had already been taken down to make room for him
here,  answered a black robe she had not noticed before
the king could not stop himself saying: good!
down with the doctors!
some of rembrandt’s pictures have that sort of background
it was the accused
the grave or my bed!
his fortress was still to be seen in number today barely his church remains
but… that’s my nasty animal,  said old falourdel, and i recognize both of them right enough!
it’s the melancholy lot of men of my profession to walk the streets at night
it is still the same inner framework, the same logical disposition of the parts
she replied with a negative nod of her head, and her pensive gaze fixed on the room’s vaulted ceiling
you will leave their huts open every night so that they can mix freely
although sicca was a sacred city it could not hold such large numbers; the temple, with its dependencies, alone took up half of it
it hid behind a wall of lake mud and defended on top by thorny brushwood
finally when it was fifty cubits up in the air it turned right and left several times, then lowered; and like a giant arm holding a cohort of pygmies in its hand, it set down the basket full of men on the edge of the wall
among other things she had a pair of little shoes!
but not a bit of interest in our lady the virgin mary
couldn’t they at least be left to swear in peace and utter the odd profanity on such a fine day, in the excellent company of churchmen and harlots?
phoebus could not see him
she and her mother just scraped a living
you will avenge us, kill me!
the condemned girl stayed unmoving where she was, waiting for them to dispose of her
they rushed upon the blades held out
so saying she threw her arms round the officer’s neck, looked up at him beseechingly and smiling beautifully amid her tears, her delicate breasts rubbed against his woollen doublet and its rough braid
i shall writhe on the ground, break stone with my forehead, damn myself, and curse you, lord, if you keep my child from me!
she could not have come for the zaïmph?
two voices were speaking there
it was a place without cover
that is too much!
then, jehan went back to the wench, and broke a bottle which was on a table, exclaiming:
lent to tigillas, until the end of the season, two kikars at /% marine interest; to bar-malkarth,  shekels against the pledge of thirty slaves
saint louis of france, my master, transgressed the church of monsieur saint paul for the same purpose; and monsieur alphonse, the king of jerusalem’s son, even the church of the holy sepulchre
the provost addressed him sternly: what have you done then to be here, scoundrel?
but i want her!
nor can our cathedral be placed in that other family of lofty, airy churches, rich with stained glass and sculpture; of pointed forms and bold attitudes; communal and civic as political symbols, free, fanciful and unrestrained as works of art; a second transformation of architecture, no longer hieroglyphic, immutable, and priestly, but artistic, progressive, and popular, which begins with the return from the crusades and ends with louis xi
at the moment when we introduced the reader to it, this little room was very dark
i’ll go round the taverns, i’ll fight, i’ll break pots, and i’ll visit the girls!
he intended to take the pont saint-michel; children were running about on the bridge with squibs and rockets
so they went to it with a will; and amid the general clamour came a fearful chorus of blasphemies and obscenities from all these unbridled tongues of clerks and students, restrained for the rest of the year by fear of saint louis’s branding irons on their tongues
quasimodo contented himself with seizing him round the waist and hurling him ten yards into the crowd
you’ll be hanged,  the other replied without hesitation
within their range, at the foot of the formidable building, lies the porte saint-antoine, hidden between its two towers
coins of gold, silver, and bronze, laid out on tables or put away in recesses, piled along all four walls up to the roofbeams
it was all her fault
it was one of those famous cages for prisoners of state known as the king’s little girls’
i saw your foot, that foot for which i would have given an empire to kiss just once and die, that foot which i should have been so overjoyed to feel crushing my head, i saw that foot clamped in that horrible boot which turns the limbs of a living creature into bloody mush
the hosier’s patriotism was flattered
it’s rather hard to explain,  the poet answered
oh, twenty if you like, master!
it had let all the water with which it had been filled run out, and the flowers in it were withered
you’re putting a lot of warmth into that oath!
they explained themselves more clearly, saying they must have hanno’s head
but parisians rarely harbour a grudge; and then, by having the performance begin on their own authority, the good citizens had scored over the cardinal, and that triumph was enough for them
she was crazy about her, and kept thanking god for her
to the left the monolithic, firm, dense, compacted, bristling trapezium of the university
then she started clapping her hands again, laughing and shouting: we are going to be happy!
mâtho resumed command of his soldiers
ideo, domni, coram stryga demonstrata, crimine patente, intentione criminis existente, in nomine sanctae ecclesiae nostrae-dominae parisiensis, quae est in saisina habendi omnimodam altam et bassam justitiam in ilia hac intemerata civitatis insula, tenore praesentium declaramus nos requirere; primo, aliquandam pecuniariam indemnitatem; secundo, amendationem honorabilem ante portalium maximum nostrae-dominae, ecclesiae cathedralis; tertio, sententiam in virtute cujus ista stryga cum sua capella, seu in trivio vulgariter dicto la grève, seu in insula exeunte in fluvio sequanae, juxta pointam jardinis regalis, executae sint!
goodness, what a pretty voice you have!
the flames from the lamp flickered in gusts of hot air
what about it, comrades?
to weaken the mercenaries the suffete had thought it wise to keep him busy far away in his kingdom
it was a strange reversal
add a score of secondary groups, serving maids and lads rushing about with jugs on their head, gamblers squatting over their billiards, marbles, dice, vachettes, the exciting game of tringlet, quarrels in one corner, kisses in another, and you will have some idea of the whole scene, over which the brightness of a great blazing fire flickered, making a thousand distorted and grotesque shadows dance over the tavern walls
beneath the stranger’s brows he met a gaze no less piercing and mistrustful than his own
that’s one defect missing,  observed jehan
rejoice, light of the baals!
even if you were satan l’hermite,  gudule replied, regaining hope, i wouldn’t tell you any different and i wouldn’t be afraid of you
here and there golden plates glinted as they moved
the town seemed to be roused
they were swarthy, with crinkly hair and silver rings in their ears
it was laden with houses, of which only the dark silhouette could be made out, boldly picked out in black against the light background of sky and water
look not at the face,
gradually he had come closer; the smell of blood, the sight of slaughter and the trumpets’ clamour had finally made his heart leap
on the upper end of the two posts they fitted a crossbar, the whole forming a very neat portable gallows, which gringoire had the satisfaction of seeing erected before him in the twinkling of an eye
god’s great thunderbolts are not for bombarding lettuces
coictier went red with anger
the only place i can take her is to la falourdel’s, the bawd on the bridge, and i’ll have to pay for the room
all right,  he cried, to the devil!
meanwhile mâtho’s immobility amazed spendius, he was even paler than before, and with staring eyes was following something on the horizon, leaning with both hands on the edge of the terrace
so, maître olivier, take this as said
nor was it the arrival of some embassy, a frequent occurrence in the fifteenth century, all bedizened and plumed
in his hand he carried one of those whips with white leather thongs used at that time by the sergeants of the wand for pushing back the crowd, and which were called boullayes
quasimodo was too deaf and claude too rapt in thought to take in all these gracious comments
suddenly the whole town rose up; blue, yellow and white veils waved on the walls, in the red evening glow
they lifted up the hyacinth curtain hanging in front of the door; and through the opening of that corner could be seen, beyond the other rooms, the great rosy sky which seemed to continue the vault, resting on the horizon upon the deep blue sea
one evening he casually asked mâtho if there were no springs inside the city
monsieur is interested in science?
she felt as though she were supported by the strength of the gods; and looking him in the face she demanded the zaïmph, asking for it in proud and eloquent words
yes’, there was some ineffable quality which made fleur-de-lys feel hurt
she fell to the pavement inert
it was, be it said in passing, a strange destiny for the church of notre-dame at that time to be thus loved to two different degrees and so devotedly by two beings as dissimilar as claude and quasimodo; loved by the one, a kind of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, its stature, the harmonies emanating from its magnificent whole; loved by the other, a man of learned and passionate imagination, for what it signified, its myth, for the meaning it contained, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its façade like the original text beneath a later one in a palimpsest; in a word, for the enigma it offered eternally to the intellect
cripple slaves, for tank’s sake!
the voice was that of phoebus de châteaupers
the king will rule in arras;
that’s the time of my appointment
unlike hanno, hamilcar would probably not go by the hot-springs mountain
the sky was white, the river water was white
my name’s jehan frollo, and my brother is an archdeacon
but suddenly the space broadened out, and they recognized the western face of the acropolis
a cry of horror went up from the truands
the victims were barely at the edge of the opening when they disappeared like a drop of water on a red hot plate, and a puff of white smoke rose up against the great scarlet mass
spendius squatted at the edge of the fountain, washing his bloody hands
the bohemian shook his head
i came within a hair’s breadth of being hanged
the numidian stayed with the mercenaries
certainly,  gringoire answered, rather taken aback by the question
a child tore off his ear; a girl, hiding the point of a spindle under her sleeve, split open his cheek; they tore out handfuls of hair, strips of flesh; others with sticks on which were stuck sponges soaked in filth dabbed at his face
by becoming a truand i cheerfully gave up half of a house in paradise that my brother promised me—dimidiam domum in paradiso [half a house in paradise/the parvis]
the beginning will have been good
next taanach slipped a large robe on her, made of cloth from the seres’ country, white with green stripes
they saw her in this attitude fearlessly eyeing all those soldiers with a gaze which had become once more wild and crazy
monsieur le recteur, it’s no one’s fault, the small shambles, parva boucheria
… salvum me fac, deus, quoniam intraverunt aquae usque ad animam meam
spendius, standing against the barrier, had them carefully searched; mâtho, facing him, examined the crowd, looking for someone whom he might have seen at salammbo’s
there is a diana flying in the air, but so outstanding, so tender, so delicate, her action so artless, her hair so beautifully dressed, crowned with a crescent, her flesh so white that it leads into temptation those who look at it with too much curiosity
he told spendius that evening
then he began running all over the church, looking for his gypsy, bellowing strange cries at every corner of the walls, scattering his red hair over the pavement
little jehan frollo, nicknamed du moulin, of the mill’, from the place where he had been put out to nurse, had not grown up along the lines which claude had tried to imprint upon him
she had dragged herself to her place
her small foot too was andalusian, for it fitted both snugly and easily into her dainty shoe
her former character came back too, even some of her gaiety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her taste for singing, her modesty
autharitus’s army now extended from tunis to rhades
the movement of its web made the huge spider suddenly shoot out of its central cell, then with one bound it pounced on the fly, bending it in two with its front antennae, while its hideous trunk scooped out the head
it was the season when the doves of carthage emigrated to sicily, to the mountain of eryx, round the temple of venus
numerous bodies of men left
when he entered the cell, he found it empty
provisions were scattered from their baskets; lumps of salt, packets of gum, rotten dates, guru nuts were trodden underfoot; and sometimes on a breast crawling with vermin, hanging on a slender cord, was some diamond sought after by satraps – an almost fabulous stone, enough to buy an empire
the archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard
this quotation which the student borrowed, perhaps to make mischief, from the cell’s wall, had a singular effect on the priest
so the people of malqua found themselves caught between the old enclosure of byrsa from behind and the barbarians in front
she is remote and quite inaccessible!
thus saying, she gazed at the captain with her large black eyes moist with joy and affection
there were only two distinct images left in his mind: la esmeralda and the gallows
twenty times during the night he got up to supervise everything himself down to the smallest details
this look lasted only for a flash
said the king in a low voice, pale and trembling with rage
look at him trotting along on his mule!
they drew up on the plain, forming a circle in front of him
at that he cried loudly: gudule!
hopes of deliverance revived
barca, carthage needs you to take command of all the punic forces against the mercenaries!
he did not finish
the thought of his son, like the touch of a god, had suddenly calmed him
he lost three more months equipping the  elephants which were kept on the ramparts; they were the conquerors of regulus; the people cherished them, and no treatment was too good for these old friends
they waited until he was in a good position in front of them
the captain was a brave man and would have been scarcely upset by a robber with a rapier in his hand
the carthaginians arrived on the plain before they did
why had he abandoned them, once peace had been concluded?
and then my mystery will bring me in a lot of hard cash, if they ever pay me for it
a good number of these honest spectators had been shivering since daybreak in front of the great steps of the palais; some even claimed to have spent the night lying in the great doorway to be sure of entering first
all the thought of that time is in fact written in that sombre romanesque style
she felt a lascivious hand straying over her
i don’t like that
the band of argoteers applauded clopin’s words and formed a circle round the gallows, laughing so unmercifully that gringoire saw that he was providing them with too much sport not to have everything to fear from them
corpses, too tightly squeezed in the crowd, did not fall; held up by their comrades’ shoulders they went on upright and staring for several minutes
the libyans also complained
human skeletons could be seen along the walls
the archdeacon had gone extremely pale
everyone rushed to the chapel
the crowd of servants parted, and mâtho passed slowly through them with bowed head; but at the door he stopped, for the fringe of the zaïmph had caught on one of the golden stars paving the flags
and then they remade it; a claim that at least neither time nor revolutions had advanced
that’s right, my good friend jehan, my poor comrade, the rue galiache, that’s right, quite right
to hasten their death they used tricks; the last remnant of their disgusting ration was stolen from them; they were trampled on, as if by accident; the dying, to make people believe they were vigorous, tried to stretch out their arms, raise themselves up, laugh
behind the purple works, whence blue smoke rose slowly into the sky, a jackal’s bark rang out; hamilcar stopped
clopin made a sign
this man, whose clothes were concealed by the crowd around him, did not look more than number years old; yet he was bald; at his temples he had scarcely more than a few scanty tufts of hair already grey; his broad, high forehead was beginning to be furrowed with wrinkles; but in his deep-set eyes shone an extraordinary youthfulness, ardent vitality, intense passion
so he would sometimes spend hours at a time squatting in front of one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it
then they turned everything upside down in confusion: mules, servants, the litter, the stores, the baggage
several times a day they came out of their camp
after all, nature was not dumb in the poor devil, and his spinal column, dreadfully misshapen though it was, was no less sensitive to excitement than anyone else’s
that was the embassy from flanders
it’s a cat of mine,  the archdeacon said quickly, treating himself to a mouse or something under there
at once he ran through the crowd, calling: master!
greenish strips hung from their foreheads; they were hacked to pieces, crushed to the marrow, turned blue by choking, or split in two by the elephants’ tusks
it was freedom of architecture
they vied with each other to get their clutches on him
a graft occurs, sap circulates, vegetation continues
the cardinal was in torment
the soldiers and the numidians were so tightly packed together that they could not draw their swords
moloch, you are burning me!
to which his companion this time replied: yes, i think so
as his spongy bones would not hold under the iron spikes, bits of his limbs had come away, and all that remained on the cross were shapeless bits and pieces, like those animal fragments that hunters hang on their doors
at that time there was no lighting in the parvis de notre-dame
yes, lord, they have just now dashed his head before my eyes against the stones of your house, and it is because of me, because of this woman, because of her…
listen to me, my friends!
or rather we have all ruined each other through the inexplicable play of fatality!
i’m unlucky enough to live near notre-dame; all night long i hear him prowling about in the guttering
quasimodo threw down at his feet, bit by bit, the student’s iron shell
i don’t see why i should have myself hanged in another person’s place
she was there, lost in the darkness, buried, interred, walled up
she started to dance again
through the forest he pursued the she-monster whose tail coiled over the dead leaves like a silver stream; and he came to a meadow where women, with the hindquarters of dragons, stood around a great fire, raised on the tips of their tails
la esmeralda’s in the place!
gringoire listened to him at first with an undecided look, then he softened, and ended by pulling a tragic grimace which made his wan face look like that of a newborn baby with colic
gringoire stopped up his ears
the ground shook beneath the stamp of countless feet
taanach went back up into the room
the king’s palaces, princely residences, churches especially had the right of asylum
for digging and searching in certain places, both in paris and elsewhere, for treasure said to be hidden, but without finding anything—number livres parisis
what about this mahiet fargel,  went on the archdeacon, whose gown you tore?
i shall do still more: you shall see!
and like a hind catching the scent of the hounds, she stood up, hurried to the window, opened it, and rushed on to the balcony
rows of arches, one behind the other, opened out in the middle of large walls separating basins
mercy, eye of baal!
the worthy deaf man, assailed on every side, had lost, if not all heart, at least all hope of saving, not himself, he had no thought of himself, but the gypsy girl
what is there to laugh at?
lay siege to the church, smash down the doors, take out the beautiful girl, save her from the judges, save her from the priests, wreck the cloister, burn the bishop in his palace, we’ll do it in less time than it takes a burgomaster to eat a spoonful of soup
good fat oudarde was getting ready to reply, and the quarrel might have led to blows, if mahiette had not suddenly cried out: just look at all those people flocking together there at the end of the bridge!
he bent over to speak in her ear and added (the spectators thought he was hearing her last confession): will you have me?
she thought now only how happy she would be to see the zaïmph again, and how she blessed schahabarim for his exhortations
four sergeants of the bailiff of the palais, whose duty was to stand guard over all popular entertainments, whether holidays or executions, stood at the four corners of the marble table
he came to visit salammbo
besides, it is still the same today, the mouth of any scholar who pays compliments to another is a jar of honeyed venom
soon the two masses formed a single chain of human bodies; it flowed over into the intervals of the terrace, and a little looser at each end, rolled about continually without making progress
it was apparently then that, as he was trying to work out in the depths of his desolate reflections who could so unexpectedly have abducted the gypsy, he thought of the archdeacon
he said in the tone of a man just waking up
they lived there, without rulers or religion, all mixed together, completely naked, both sickly and wild, execrated by the people for centuries because of their disgusting diet
all of a sudden lights appeared on the topmost terrace of the palace, the middle door opened, and a woman, hamilcar’s daughter herself, dressed in black, appeared on the threshold
meanwhile the ranks of the clibanarii lay extended over the plain; the mercenaries tore their armour off them, put it on, then returned to the fight
they took my child away, they stole my child, they ate my child
don’t bite me, monster!
the three long vessels, filled almost to sinking point, advanced to the applause of the watching army
mouths open to cry remained gaping; hands flew as they were lopped off
no one could follow them or even speak to them, or approach the ramparts; for a few minutes the whole town was as silent as a huge tomb
suddenly he was choked by sobs, and collapsing to his knees:
asylums were hedged about with such respect that, according to tradition, it extended at times even to animals
they had been telling me for the past few days: la falourdel, don’t work too hard at your spinning-wheel in the evenings, the devil likes to comb old women’s distaffs with his horns
they give me an écu
the priest struck his forehead
beneath her hair, which spread out down to the ground, a harsh and wasted profile could just be discerned; from her robe just the tip of a bare foot protruded, clenched on the freezing, unyielding stone
in the middle twelve copper pedestals each bore a great glass ball, and vague gleams of red filled these hollow globes, like enormous eyeballs still pulsing with life
said mâtho, i will go on with the war all alone!
hamilcar seized the slave with one leap; covering the man’s mouth with his hands, he cried still louder:
she wanted to know him better and yet his presence would have embarrassed her
as if it were something impossible and hamilcar someone immortal
the wheel began to turn
this little bedroom’ which the king had kept for himself in the famous state prison was still spacious enough, and occupied the top floor of a turret set into the keep
they felt seized with shame, and anger, at having been kept in check for so long before the church by a hunchback
the elders had been dragged away
they filled the street so that the walls almost burst, and this long mass of armed soldiers streamed out between the tall rows of six-storied houses, daubed with tar
but soon realizing that any denial would be vain, hamilcar gave way; and he showed them into the trading house
the two visitors withdrew
it’s true,  he said, i was forgetting that we are in a hurry—but that’s no reason, master, to rage at people so
in a few minutes the sentence was drawn up
the captain roared with laughter: corne de baœuf!
i think i touched his heart with the tip
her arms, adorned with diamonds, were left bare outside a sleeveless tunic, spangled with red flowers on a dead black background
this grand staircase, as i say, poured ceaselessly into the place like a cascade into a lake
if you have come from hell, i am going there with you
they shook their collars full of little bells, trumpeted; and their drivers bent their heads beneath the shower of fire-arrows which began to rain from the towers
then they penetrated into a small, completely circular room, so high that it looked like the inside of a pillar
you know, madame, that many most pious princes have trespassed against the privilege of churches for the glory of god and the needs of the state
the phalanx exterminated the remnant of the barbarians at their leisure
spendius, who had spent three years in the slave prison, did not know the districts at all well
the human heart (dom claude had meditated on such matters) can contain only a certain amount of despair
the immense accumulation at carnac is already a completed formula
the university was built on hilly ground
so the disaster he had feared for so long had come, and he sought frantically to see whether there was no way, no means of escape
as he said this in his gentlest voice, he came extremely close to the gypsy girl, his fondling hands resumed their position around that delicate, supple waist, his eyes grew brighter and brighter, and all the evidence proclaimed that monsieur phoebus was clearly on the brink of one of those moments when jupiter himself commits such follies that good homer is obliged to enlist the aid of a cloud
at the corner of the street of sateb he leaned against the low roof of a shop, back to the wall, and went no further
this spectator had missed nothing of what had been going on since midday before the portal of notre-dame
spendius fell in a faint on the mat
and she went back to stroking the pretty creature, saying over and over: djali!
he put a question or two to her all the same
the church is watched day and night
so claude crouched down in the dust and lumps of plaster which crumbled beneath him
you ask why i rescued you
and heedless of their clamouring, he said that in abandoning the suffete, it was the republic they had abandoned
and she had the sweetest fine dark hair, which was already curling
the unclean-eaters thought up atrocious things
what a feeling one has of waters falling, sap failing, the thought of ages and peoples withdrawing from it!
let’s get a move on, she would recognize me
phoebus,  the gypsy continued, gently removing the captain’s tenacious hands from round her waist, you are kind, you are generous, you are handsome
and to have nothing to offer her but a dingy priest’s cassock which would fill her with fear and disgust!
there was no cavalry to extricate them, except for  numidians who turned against the right-hand squadron of the clibanarii
that’ll do,  trouillefou broke in, without letting him finish
during an eclipse she had almost died
it was indefinable and charming; something pure, resonant, airy, winged, so to speak
the phalanx began to waver, the captains ran about in dismay, the rear numbers pushed the soldiers, and the barbarians had reformed; they were returning; victory was theirs
then he went off towards the cape of grapes and made a long detour to encircle the barbarians, an inopportune and even dangerous operation
it was impossible for the barbarians to resist; only the greek infantry had bronze weapons; all the others had cutlasses on the ends of poles, sickles taken from farms, swords made out of wheel-rims; the blades were too soft and twisted as they struck, and while they tried to straighten them under their heels the carthaginians, to right and left, massacred them at leisure
none the less, to give criticism its due as well, the poet could have developed this fine idea in something less than two hundred lines
she had no doubt about it
name of a pope!
hell with you there is my heaven, the sight of you is more delightful than that of god!
pretty fine heart of oak,  said the king, thumping the frame work with his fist
under the rope sparkled a little amulet decorated with green glass beads, which she had been allowed to keep, no doubt because nothing is refused to those about to die
a procession of all the gentlemen of france, with their oriflammes blazing red for all to see
eh, you lynx, haven’t you ever lain with your mate?
a plague on all fireworks!
a third was solemnly using his finger to spread over the table the melted tallow dripping from a candle
if you are to die, it will be later,  he said, later!
good-day, monsieur le recteur!
said gringoire, lost in the innumerable twists and turns, continually doubling back on themselves, but through which the girl followed a path which she seemed to know well, without hesitating and walking ever faster and faster
you are not well!
and each of them is deep, fifty cubits and full to the top!
hamilcar was quite sure that no one could take his son away from him
that’s right,  rym whispered to coppenole, punish the people for wanting, and do what they wanted
along the narrow paths the sentries marched to keep warm, or stood looking towards the horizon, with their pikes on their shoulders in a threatening attitude
he had, though, never felt such anxiety; if he succumbed it meant the destruction of the republic and he would perish on a cross; if, on the other hand, he won, by way of the pyrenees, gaul, and the alps he would reach italy and the barca’s empire would be eternal
it is still the same fibre vibrating, the deepest and most sensitive one; but instead of an angel stroking it, it is a demon who plucks it cruelly
guillaume rym made a deep bow, while coppenole, with his surly expression, looked like one of those bears his majesty had been speaking about
sometimes a plump hand, covered with rings, half opened the litter; a harsh voice shouted insults; then the bearers would stop, and take another route through the camp
an influence had come down from the moon upon the maiden; when the star was on the wane salammbo grew weaker
in paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords claiming quit-rent, there were twenty-five claiming justice and quit-rent, from the bishop of paris, who had a hundred and five streets, to the prior of notre-dame-des-champs, who had four
they moved aside when he went by, rolling his huge blue eyes
the spectacle it was awaiting was obviously one of those which are privileged to bring out and attract the lowest dregs of the population
what’s the matter with you that you’re whispering like that?
that’s a fine milch-cow for you
the archdeacon held out his hand to him: that’s settled then?
he began to flee through the church
finally, as their drivers were called indians’ (after the first ones, no doubt, who had come from india), he ordered that they should all be dressed in indian style, that is with a white padded band round their temples and a small loin cloth of byssus, which with its transverse folds looked like the two halves of a seashell fitting round their hips
this cell had been famous in paris for nearly three centuries, ever since madame rolande of the tour-roland, in mourning for her father who had died on the crusades, had had it hollowed out from the wall of her own house and there shut herself up for ever, retaining of her palace nothing but this dwelling, of which the door was walled up and the window open, winter and summer; all the rest she gave to the poor and to god
after a moment a symphony, intended to produce a striking effect as the holy virgin arrived, failed to materialize
and he closed the book violently
it was on the first day, but i got stung
the girl kneeling before the gibbet, covered by her long, flowing hair, let him speak without interruption
there is an old charter which expresses it artlessly, on the subject of loyalty: fidelitas in reges, quae tamen aliquoties seditionibus interrupta, multa peperit privilegia [loyalty to kings, although interrupted by a certain number of insurrections, has won many privileges])
he reckoned that there is nothing like the spectacle of a criminal trial for driving away melancholy, entertaining as the judges’ stupidity usually is
you can see that i am putting it together
if the reader wishes to know by whom, he has only to listen in to the conversation of three worthy gossips who, at the moment when we fixed our attention on the rat-hole, were proceeding in the very same direction as they walked beside the river up from the châtelet towards the grève
good-night father, good-night mother!
but woken by the sound of voices and footsteps they slowly stood up, came towards the elders, whom they recognized from their dress, rubbed against their legs and arched their backs with resounding yawns; their steaming breath passed over the light from the torches
behind, in the shadow cast by this trellis, a small boat lay hidden
meanwhile the chief truands had withdrawn beneath the porch of the gondelaurier mansion and were holding a council of war
salammbo, almost in a faint, was carried back on to her throne by priests bustling round her
lasciate ogni speranza[all hope abandon …]
as his distress increased, so their joy became greater, and amid catcalls those at the back cried out:
between mankind and himself the condemned person felt weighing down on his head an accumulation of stones and gaolers, and the whole prison, the massive fortress, was just an immense, complex lock shutting him out from the world of the living
she approached, seized the weapon by the hilt
in the daytime one could admire the variety of its buildings, all carved in stone or wood, and already offering complete samples of the different types of medieval domestic architecture, going back from the fifteenth through to the eleventh century, from the casement which was beginning to oust the ogive, back to the round romanesque arch which the ogive had supplanted, and which still occupied, beneath the ogive, the first floor of that ancient house of the tour-roland, in the corner of the place giving on to the seine, on the rue de la tannerie side
mâtho wanted to go up in the first to be ready
the good man had no other fields to cultivate but the king’s ill health
get a move on,  said tristan
to speak to mâtho,  she answered
above the officers’ commands, the trumpets’ calls and the scraping of the lyres, lead bullets and clay pellets whistled through the air, tore swords out of men’s hands, the brains out of their skulls
thus quasimodo’s gratitude was deep, passionate, unbounded; and although his adoptive father’s face was often stern and overcast, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude had never faltered for a moment
i’d very much like to know if it is god’s grace that there should be in paris anyone else with highway rights but the king, any other justice than our parliament, any other emperor than us in this empire!
they had seen such sums come out of it that they judged it to be inexhaustible; gisco had buried some in his tent
the incense smoked more fiercely in its large burners, and the naked masseurs, sweating like sponges, squeezed over his joints a paste composed of corn, sulphur, black wine, bitches’ milk, myrrh, galbanum, and styrax
he was too far from the social state and too near the state of nature to know what shame was
touched by this, she raised her head to answer
all night the people split into groups and debated at the street corners
his sword was there, near you!
gringoire realized that his band had been taken off by the procession of the pope of fools
but the elephants, whose rations had been cut, were restless in their tethers
and to go every evening, as was his wont, to that charming house in the rue galilee, in the precincts of the palais-royal, which he held in the right of his wife, madame ambroise de lore, to rest from the fatigue of sending some poor devil to spend his night in that little cell in the rue de l’escorcherie, which the provosts and échevins of paris were wont to use as their prison; it being number feet long, number feet number inches wide and n feet high
said jehan, that was nothing much!
they grew denser, larger; black mounds swayed along; suddenly square thickets appeared; it was the elephants and lances; a single cry rose up: the carthaginians!
my friends, my name is jehan du moulin, and i’m a gentleman
not for the banal reason that fire warms our feet or cooks our soup, but because it gives off sparks
everything is there, the cost of digging pits to put the sow in, the five hundred bundles of sticks collected from the harbour at morsant, the three pints of wine and the bread, the victim’s last meal, fraternally shared with the executioner, down to the eleven days of guarding and feeding the sow at number deniers parisis a day
olivier knelt down, and said coldly: sire, a witch has been condemned to death by your court of parliament
salammbo let herself slide down to him; and they made off at full gallop, circling the punic camp, looking for a gate somewhere
if only you could break that dreadful web with your gnat’s wings, you think you could reach the light!
mâtho felt his heart torn and his faith, as it were, betrayed
he embarked once more on flight
i don’t have any
this time he did not correct himself
the negress flung herself to the ground at his feet, and tried to kiss them; he roughly picked her up
everything was wiped out, everything was black
she took her feet in her hands, a habitual gesture of unhappy creatures who are cold, already observed in the recluse of the tour-roland, and her teeth chattered
they did not hurt her, but when these men touched her, when the leather touched her, she felt all her blood run back into her heart
were we now to try to penetrate as far as quasimodo’s soul through that hard, thick crust; were we to plumb the depths of that misshapen organism; were it given to us to inspect with a torch behind those organs impermeable to light, to explore the dark interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate its obscure corners and absurd impasses, and suddenly to cast a bright light on the psyche chained up in the depths of that cavern, we should no doubt find the wretch in some pathetic, stunted, rachitic posture like those prisoners kept below the roof in venice, growing old bent double in a stone box too low and too short for movement
they are richer and less sacred
the asturian bull, unmoved by the picador’s attacks, is irritated by the dogs and banderillas
hamilcar went forward to the candelabra
in the angle of the pediments, on top of the walls, in the corner of the squares, everywhere, could be seen divinities with hideous heads, colossal or squat, with huge bellies or disproportionately flattened, opening their jaws, spreading their arms, holding forks, chains or javelins; and the blue of the sea lay at the bottom of the streets, made to look even steeper by the perspective
very well,  the king’s advocate said drily, he’s dying
but since you don’t like it, i don’t mind being called goton
the suffete had the idea of negotiations to gain time, and one morning the barbarians found in their lines a sheepskin covered with writing
they resumed their march
everywhere lay scattered gums, powders, roots, glass phials, branches of filipendula, rose petals; and the smells were suffocating, despite the swirls of styrax crackling in the middle on a bronze tripod
now and then this noise and clamour grew louder, the current driving the whole crowd towards the grand staircase ebbed, broke into turbulence and eddies
but i do, i see a lot of objections!
the gods dwell where their effigies are
it’s the bailiff burning
no, you don’t know it, you were too small!
she’s got it into her head
the greatest disasters,  answered mistricole
she came down the first staircase which ran diagonally along the first floor, then the second, the third, and she stopped, on the last terrace, at the head of the galley staircase
said the king between two sips of tisane
the very next day he drew , gold kikars from the syssitia, and decreed a tax of  shekels on the rich
at that hour all the members of the syssitia were asleep
spendius had raised one of the slabs, entered the water, and then closed it again on himself
a new day was dawning
they had recognized quasimodo
the girl pulled a face
do i hate them?
the crowbars and hammers were working away below
the streets were invested, the church backed on to the river
he said, so that the strength of the serpents, children of the sun, may penetrate the marrow of your bones, and take courage, reflection of the gods!
eustache, who up to that moment had been distracted by a little cart pulled by a large dog, which had just gone by, suddenly noticed that his three guides were looking at something through the window and, seized with curiosity in his turn, he got up on a marker stone, stood on tiptoe and stuck his fat, red face in the opening as he cried: mother, do let me see then!
trembling and straining his eyes, he gazed, beyond eschmoûn, at the high terrace of a palace set above palm trees: an ecstatic smile lit up his face, as if some great light had dawned upon him; he opened his arms, sent kisses on the breeze and murmured: come, come!
the girl stayed motionless, frozen, speechless before the terrifying apparition, like a dove raising its head just as the round-eyed osprey looks into the nest
end of the gold écu turned into a dry leaf
quasimodo leaned out over the square and saw that the object of this frantic, tender appeal was a young man, a captain, a handsome horseman, with gleaming weapons and finery, who was caracoling by at the far end of the square, and taking off his plumed hat to a lovely lady smiling on her balcony
the storm was moving away; occasional drops of water splashed one by one to vibrate the roof of the tent
just one little parisis, brother,  jehan persisted with his entreaty
he lived alone in his tent, with only a young boy by him, and no one ever ate with them, not even narr’havas, for whom, however, he showed extraordinary consideration since hanno’s defeat; but the numidian king had too much interest in becoming his son not to be wary
he looks at the sails passing far out to sea; he is gloomy, he refuses food, he asks questions about the gods, and he wants to know carthage
the carthaginians grinding their teeth looked at the top of the hill where the barbarians stood
meanwhile the captain’s gesture had uncovered the mysterious amulet that she wore round her neck
when he fell silent, exhausted and panting, she repeated faintly: oh!
anyhow,  added the first soldier, there isn’t a boat on this side of the water or on the other
some districts were already talking and making a noise
she entreated him with a suppliant look
he repeatedly sent messages urging autharitus and spendius to make haste
now we should like permission from those of our readers with the power to generalize an image or idea, as the modern style puts it, to ask whether they have a clear picture of the scene presented by the vast parallelogram of the great hall of the palais at the moment on which our attention is focused
the bronze statue continued to advance towards khamon square
this kind of tomb was in any case by no means rare in towns in the middle ages
the great silver cross glimmered in the depths of the darkness, sprinkled with a few points of twinkling light, like the milky way of that sepulchral night
she opened an eye, looked at quasimodo, then abruptly closed it again, as if terrified by her saviour
where are you going then?
some watched in the embrasures with fishing nets and when a barbarian arrived he found himself caught in the meshes and struggled like a fish
she saw a great body of armed men, on foot and on horseback, drawn up on the grève
he said in rapture, and flung his arm round the gypsy’s waist
the quay was absolutely deserted
these two images brought together confronted him with a terrifying group, and the more he concentrated on them what remained of his powers of attention and thought, the more he saw them grow, in a fantastic progression, the one in grace, charm, beauty, light, the other in horror, so that in the end la esmeralda appeared to him as a star, the gibbet as a huge fleshless arm
the punic slingers, pushed aside here and there, stayed gaping
the leather tent, turned up at the corners, gave a view of the whole mountainside covered with soldiers, and as she was at the centre, salammbo could be seen from every side
who told me so?
do you know who it might be?
it was known that there were scarcely , left, and to finish them off there was no need to use soldiers
are you really going to take my daughter from me?
a hundred and twenty livres, and not even parisis
it was indeed the first month of the year
then they saw a long scar on his pale forehead; it twitched like a snake between his eyebrows; he was trembling in every limb
the king of tunis went on
the laughing band of children was already far off
at once he sent off narr’havas to guard the borders of his kingdom
they danced deliriously round the great waterfall and, in the wildness of their joy, ran into it to wet their heads
for pity’s sake, tell me if he is alive!
as for jehan frollo, he was in a critical situation
but today there was resentment against them because the money was not there to pay them
i could cast myself at your knees; why!
the streets grew deeper and narrower; every open space was filled up and disappeared
horn and thunder,  said one of the two drinkers
the second effect of his misfortune was to make him vicious
vanished with the mother,  mahiette replied
she murmured, it’s the icy hand of death,—who are you, then?
beside this breviary is a narrow, pointed window, closed by two intersecting iron bars, looking on to the square, the only opening which admits a little fresh air and daylight to a small doorless cell, set at ground level in the thickness of the old house’s wall, and filled with a peace made all the more profound, a silence made all the more mournful by the fact that a public square, the noisiest and busiest in paris, teems and yells all around
there was no sound but the whirr of crickets
recall these impressions, and you will easily realize what gringoire felt as he contemplated in visible and palpable form that esmeralda of whom, up till then, he had caught only a glimpse through a whirlwind of dance, song, and excitement
the soldier’s terror as he examines the bronze battering ram and says: the tower will crumble
one in particular had a great gleaming scythe for a long time mowing at the horses’ legs
the crowd clapped their hands
a month, maybe two weeks, my lord
the man did not fall
such an imperious demeanour intimidated him
their companions, waiting for them, and not seeing them come back, thought they had been betrayed
then leaning to speak in his ear: i have brought you with me to steal it!

their horses fidgeted, dazzled by the glare of the torches, which crackled in the darkness; the human spectre struggled and shouted:

all sorts of most violent weapons
some of them climbed up beside him

some appeared holding parasols, with parrots on their shoulders
demonades how i am suffering!
she did not seem to notice

about two years, or eighteen months, after the events which conclude this history, when they came to the cellar to look for the corpse of olivier le daim, who had been hanged two days before, and to whom charles viii granted the favour of being buried at saint-laurent in better company, they found among all these hideous carcasses two skeletons, one clasping the other in a strange embrace

compère coppenole—they serve no purpose
he had a linen robe, with flowers painted on it, and golden fringes at the bottom; two silver arrows held back his braided hair at the edge of his ears; his right hand rested on a pike shaft, decorated with amber rings and tufts of bristles

in most cases it was enough to present the tambourine to the goat in such and such a way to obtain from it the desired trick

the monotonous chant of those saying the offices, the people’s response to the priest, sometimes a mumble, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious vibration of the stained glass, the organ blaring out like a hundred trumpets, the three bell towers humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra, over which a gigantic musical scale leaped without cease up and down from congregation to bell tower, deadened her memory, her imagination, her pain

archdeacon claude was also believed to have made a thorough study of the colossal statue of saint christopher and the long, enigmatic figure which then stood at the entrance from the parvis and which the people derisively called monsieur legris but what everyone had been able to observe was the interminable hours he often spent, sitting on the parapet of the parvis, contemplating the statues of the doorway, sometimes examining the foolish virgins with their lamps upside down, sometimes the wise virgins with their lamps upright; at other times calculating the angle of sight of the crow on the left-hand doorway, looking at some mysterious point inside the church where the philosophers’ stone is surely hidden, if it is not in nicolas flamel’s cellar
quasimodo picked up his lantern and went down on to the platform between the towers for a closer view and to work out some means of defence

salammbo kept going forward; the barbarian knelt, and a long arrow pierced the hem of her robe
spendius, on the contrary, became bolder and more cheerful

the doctor glanced at him
i stamped my foot under the desk

i’ve left my purse behind
during our drive, trishatov told me rather breathlessly that there had been some sort of a deal between lambert and pockmarked semyon but that the pockmarked one had changed his mind at the last moment and had now sent trishatov to mrs prutkov to warn her not to believe what alphonsine might tell her and to beware of lambert
stop that, gregory, don’t keep abusing him like that, mr karamazov interrupted him
i understand that it would be an indiscretion on your part
we have been granted what we may call an audience’ by the person in question and, therefore, grateful though we are to you for showing us the way, we won’t be able to invite you to come in with us

he loved both his brothers and the possibility of such a rivalry frightened him
but he didn’t do it

i also told vasin what stebelkov had said about the baby
well, i guess you’d better stay here then, she said with a smile

they are the most dangerous!
i hope you will accept these flowers, sofia, he said
and please forgive me, kraft, for coming to your house and talking nonsense

if i’ve killed him, i’ve killed him
i’ve been dealing with gorstkin for a long time, you know

he also had a message for her
you mean your father?
he could break into the house, dash through the rooms, push his father out of his way, even hit him
when, then, the prosecutor asked him what grounds he had for asserting that fyodor karamazov had acted dishonestly toward his son with regard to that estate, gregory, to everyone’s surprise, was unable to offer any support for his statement but simply insisted that the settlement was unfair and that the father ought to have paid the son a few thousand more
he is filled with the best of intentions and is a very sensitive person, vasin said, but he is neither reasonable nor strong-willed enough to control his whims
let her think that i am a horrid young fool who's been spying on her and scheming, but i want her to recognize that in the end i have conquered myself and put her happiness above everything else in the world
ivan and alyosha then went back to the living room
i have heard about all that, my boy, people have told me many times about these things
usually he was much more cheerful and relaxed
mitya was now very frightened of grushenka, anticipating that the pole would make a scene
but why is he better than me?
i was moved to tears, arkady, because i ca not think what i have done to deserve such warm affection on your part
no, you are an ungrateful little beast, that's what you are!
this was the same night, perhaps even the very same hour, that alyosha threw himself down on the ground and ecstatically vowed to love the earth forever and ever
she kept bombarding me with questions
where was i off to?
if it hadn’t been for gregory, there would have been no one to change the boy’s shirt
there is confusion among the people, shouting and weeping
and this is what actually hurt me most: how could it be that everyone else knew about it except me?
i have no idea really why i have lived
what possible reason could you have had for agreeing to go to chermashnya then, instead of going to moscow, just because i asked you to?
i don’t believe it’s possible to live in rebellion, and i want to live!
are you really leaving town very soon?
he thrust the twenty-five-ruble bill into his pocket, feeling terribly awkward in front of alyosha
i’ll go wherever you wish, madam, but now
he's stuffed with thousands of preconceptions and extraordinary notions, but there's not one original idea in his head
kalganov seemed irritated at something, while maximov was laughing
now, if you could convince me, arkady, that this family is an exception, an accident, i would be very relieved
then he replaced the pistols in the case, locked the case with a little key, and picked it up
you might be his father or something
you know, lisa, although i had words with him this morning—as you may perhaps have heard—i am still sincerely fond of him and wish him luck
i cried, glaring savagely at stebelkov
he was very closely shaven except for neatly trimmed whiskers that looked like two thin sausages suspended on each side of his flat and evil-looking face
i didn’t have to tell you
for a few days after that, we would get together and talk about it, secretly as it were, and that was all we talked about
so we have here a second reason impelling him to hold on jealously to the money sewn in the bag, not to open the bag, and certainly not to fish out one hundred-ruble bill after another
i was involved in a terrible mixture of twisted emotions and heartbreak
he would take her away at once
dmitry might be lying in wait for her somewhere, so as soon as she knocked on the window (smerdyakov had told him two days ago that he had explained to her where and how to knock) he would have to let her in at once, without wasting a second, for who knew what might happen otherwise?
there seems to be reservation in your praise
and what about the pestle?
he declared at the preliminary hearing and he was still trembling all over as he spoke to us, although by then the man who had terrorized him was safely under lock and key and could no longer harm him
she has a degree and is impatient to return to petersburg and fight for women’s rights on the banks of the neva
everything is turning, turning, the stove is turning
apparently everything was not in order in the second cart, in which two men with brass badges were to accompany the rural police officer
do you really imagine that i could not bear the emancipation of the serfs?
i helped timofei harness and i know which way he went
and, just as he would expected, at two o'clock in the afternoon he received a visit from a certain baron r, a forty-year-old colonel, one of those german barons of whom there are so many in the russian service, who are full of their baronial arrogance though penniless, who have to live on their pay and are the most zealous sticklers for rules and regulations
and he remembered all those he had wronged and tried to make it up to them
but of late sergei seemed to be changing, as did his feelings toward versilov
can’t you look where you’re walking, you hooligan!
i said, waving him away, feeling on the verge of tears
we will see about that later
there are people, women especially, whom it helps to talk and talk when they are struck by a catastrophe; also there are some people who have been, as it were, worn away by misery, who have been hurt too often during their lifetime, who have suffered terrible disasters and experienced constant hardships, and who, even within the sight of the dead body of a loved one, never forget the dearly acquired art of getting along with others
for they keep on reading all their lives and, having filled themselves with bookish wisdom, they talk and talk, although they never find answers to what's bothering them and remain in the darkness
mitya made everyone stop dancing and be quiet
all right, he said, i will reveal my secret to you and tell you where the money came from; i will expose myself to shame and disgrace so that later i can’t accuse either myself or you
and that's what enraged me most!
it’s really incredible that it should have come back to me only now!
feeling that lise did not want to waste the time that her mother was out of the room, he told her briefly and with many omissions, but quite clearly and matter-of-factly, about his strange adventure with the schoolboys
and you did so while in a state of tremendous agitation and while trying to escape?
he knew that big wooden inn very well, with all its barns, sheds, and verandahs
many said of the elder that, in accepting all those who had come throughout the years to entrust their souls to him, to seek his guidance and solace, he had heard so many confessions, secrets, and tales of human despair that he had finally acquired an insight so keen that he could guess, from the very first glance at a newcomer, what he would say, what he would ask him, and even what was really tormenting his conscience
prevent me from being generous and magnanimous
but who cares really because everything is so awfully nice
he glared challengingly at his interrogators
he decided, feeling really sick now; but instead of walking away, he began to bang wildly on the gate
so i never gave it a thought when, to my great surprise, i began noticing certain signs
it’s a funny law too
and this time it’s the truth
in real life, thousands of things may have happened that would have escaped the scrutiny of the subtlest fiction writer
i feel very guilty toward him
the wise and dreaded spirit of self-destruction and nonexistence,  the old man went on, spoke to you in the desert and we learn from the books that he tried to tempt you
with what ye mete, it shall be measured to you again
the apartment was still under mrs prutkov's supervision
what i actually want to tell you was that in case of—let’s call it an emergency—i mean when they ask your papa to produce those four-and-a-half thousand that he doesn’t have, well, rather than let him be court-martialed and demoted to the ranks in his old age, i suggest you secretly send me your learned little sister, because i’ve just received some money and i guess i could let her have, say, four thousand
unless he wants to kill bjoring?
every time i came to see you, i suspected that the only reason you received me so nicely was to find out whatever i might know about that document, to reduce me to a state in which i would have to tell you everything
when he first arrived in our town, his father questioned him suspiciously, trying to find out just what had brought him here before he had finished school
live as long as you can
he was standing at an angle to father paisii and he did not turn to face him fully
the lady had detested him from the very beginning, simply because he was engaged to katerina, who, she had for some reason decided, should break off with him and marry his brother ivan instead, such a nice, chivalrous, cultured man with such charming manners
it is also true that, at the same moment, the spilt blood was crying out for vengeance, for he was now a man who had lost his soul and his right to live on earth; and he knew that, as of this moment, he was just nothing to the being he loved more than his soul, now that her first and rightful’ one had come back to her and was prepared to make up to her the harm he had done her and offer her a new and happy life!
he’s never mentioned you at all as far as i know
mitya, who’s that looking at us from over there?
alyosha suddenly remembered that, as he was leaving the summer house the day before, he had noticed a low, green garden bench by the fence, half concealed under the bushes
mitya could not even consider him as a man now, for everyone in town knew that samsonov was a wreck, whose relations with grushenka could only be those of a father with his daughter—not at all what they had been before—and that it had been that way for quite some time already, almost a whole year
in the morning i sent a note to someone, asking him to come and see me without fail
so you’re saving me already!
mrs prutkov and miss anna are great friends now
sergei hesitated, it could have been
the grand inquisitor falls silent and waits for some time for the prisoner to answer
i shouted and ran out again
you called me a spy just now!
yes, i only care for you and for some slut i’ve fallen in love with, who will drive me to my perdition
are you really matthew?
and it might have robbed me of his love too
i’ve come, madam
however, this poor young man deserved infinitely better of life, for he had a good heart when he was a child and even when he was no longer a child
then he also made the necessary inquiries to check whether all the persons whose names i had tossed around in my babbling really existed
and it's not only for the reader's sake
yes, but i hit smurov in the head!
i can understand the concept of solidarity in sin and also solidarity in retribution
although obviously i could not have left with it
vasin, however, also picked up his cap to leave at the same time
all right, then, let's change the setting
i’ll be able to talk to her now, for yesterday she insisted that i come and see her today
he had once consulted the moscow doctor whom katerina had invited to our town, following through on an idea i have already mentioned
but i wo not even sit down
and tears gushed from her eyes as she clung to mitya’s hand, never relaxing her grip
so let there be no more of this, monks, let there be no more brutalized children; rise up against it, preach against it, hasten to do so!
do not you see that by publicizing your illegitimacy, which in itself was slander, you were violating your mother's secret and, for the perverse satisfaction of your own false pride, you were placing her at the mercy of anyone who wanted to throw dirt at her!
of course he won’t, i know it only too well
they stood there looking into each other’s eyes
i would seen it before and had noticed it again three days earlier while walking through the museum
so you give him a punch in the face
no, to you, to you
the presiding judge still sounded distrustful
he let out a mirthless little laugh, looking sort of sideways, away from her
and perezvon was supposed to remain like this without moving for any length of time—as long as half an hour, kolya claimed—until his master ordered him to move
alyosha asked, looking thoughtfully at his brother
there are a few things i’ll tell them there
i still remember, detail by detail, everything about that day!
he could always stop himself before breaking the law and, at times, he wondered at that himself
and you’d still be carrying my little notes when you were forty
lambert shouted, panic-stricken, grabbing me by the sleeve of my coat
i have brought you here because of a whim of my heart
and now i want to end, gentlemen, with a plea: please, gentlemen, try to unlearn once and for all the prescribed methods for conducting interrogations!
i simply respect people who are competent
i never even suspected in what a false position i was; i swear to god i had no inkling of what mattered to him most!
the little peasant who had been hired to drive the second cart and was putting on his coat was still arguing that akim should be the one to drive the cart and not him
although they just may go your way
i will use our special language to make her understand that the document is safe and that she must be here tomorrow morning at ten, at ten o'clock sharp
later the same day, he had gone to see father ferapont in his isolated cell behind the apiary, and the visit had made a tremendous and terrifying impression on him
that his loathing would perhaps get the better of him, and then he could kill him
during all this time, smerdyakov, pale and trembling, had stayed in the opposite corner of the room, huddling close to mr karamazov
i guess i must have hit the ground with the back of my head and remained unconscious a minute or two
something frightfully dramatic must have happened between the two of them!
as to having me locked up, you only want it done because you’re jealous of me, because you’ve been chasing after that woman yourself
i’d never dare tell gregory about the signals unless the master ordered me to
the prosecutor frowned violently
i didn’t even dare tell my brother alyosha about the fifteen hundred rubles, so horrible did it feel to be a crook and a thief!
when, after his talk with alyosha, ivan reached the house where he lived and, about to ring the bell at the gate, pulled his hand back and decided to go and see smerdyakov instead, he was yielding to a sudden angry impulse
i close my eyes and let my imagination wander, and during those minutes i feel an irresistible strength within me
see me off now
he would been converted to catholicism while abroad
indeed, she went so far that the boys ended up by teasing kolya precisely because of her, taunting him with being a sissy and a mummy’s boy
but tell me, have you ever tried to tempt those who feed on locusts, pray in the desert for seventeen years, and are overgrown with moss?
do you think you have the right to reveal even a single mystery of the world from which you come?
i have noted down a detailed account of a well-educated, cultured gentleman and his wife flogging their own seven-year-old daughter
moreover, the shop-assistant, who had been out of the shop during the murder, not only told the police the exact sum missing, but also described the bills and the coins, that is, the number of rainbow-colored bills, blue, ten-ruble bills, red, five-ruble bills, how many gold coins and of what denominations
the same discrediting technique was applied to the poles, who came in with haughty and arrogant airs, declared that they were servants of the crown, that the accused had tried to buy their honor for three thousand rubles, and that they themselves had seen him holding in his hands large sums of money
today, it may be a lady, but tomorrow a whore may take her place
what a sweet boy!
so he would have to face her all alone
he kept tormenting himself terribly, she said
in fact, he was an obstinate and at times brash man who talked with self-assurance, was very definite in his judgments, and lived respectfully, as he put it rather strangely
it’s the fact that you could have the same dream as i had
how could you not forgive her after she said to you herself, forgive me’?
but there was something in that smile that was anything but friendly
i’m sure that a thinker of your caliber must approach every social phenomenon with a perfectly open mind and have a very unprejudiced view of things
rakitin cannot understand that
was shouted from the crowd
let's go then, he said with an obvious effort
'we will pay him back first thing when i get a job and he will see that we are as honest as we are proud, which he already understood
because i would discovered what an extraordinary and noble person you are
he was filled, however, with a vague, entirely different sort of apprehension
but is that the truth?
but at that moment something almost unbelievably absurd took place, a worthy finale to the whole preposterous episode
that’s what smerdyakov says
what are you afraid of?
but you may very well have decided that i am a pig, because it would have been difficult to behave worse than i did
the next day i told myself that the incident was closed, over and done with, and that there must be no sequel to it
and that relative of hers, the rich general’s widow, not only gave katya her blessing, but even went so far as to congratulate her, believe it or not
i walked over to him, but he threw a stone at me too and then another one, aimed at my head
you know how beautiful she is
you’ll hear me out, you’ll understand, and you’ll forgive
but i was in a hurry to convince them, to beat them at their own game
and, if i may, i’d like to come back sometime and talk to you about it some more
several boys from ilyusha’s class were visiting him and every one of them, like smurov, would have angrily denied that it was alyosha who had made peace between him and ilyusha and that, if he was there now, it was because of alyosha
then he remembered and said to god: once,  he said, she pulled up an onion in her garden and gave it to a beggar woman
kraft tore it up
he poured oil on the flames
that’s rebellion, alyosha said softly, lowering his eyes
i am sure it's utter nonsense
but you must have gathered that much yourself, i am sure
you mean about my prostrating myself before him for the money?
it meant a lot to me because versilov came there on his own initiative to see me after our quarrel and then returned many times
so you’re absolutely convinced that someone was here with you?
i did promise
mind you, according to smerdyakov, the money was under the mattress, and the accused is supposed to have pulled it out from under the mattress
tell me, how did you manage to get here so quickly?
where could he get three thousand?
i have sinned, my father, and i’m afraid of my sin
smerdyakov sat on the bench by the garden gate, enjoying the cool evening air, and ivan at once realized that it was this man who had been weighing on his mind, that he could not bear the very idea that this creature existed
lise, for heaven’s sake, stop that screaming!
alphonsine screamed and squealed desperately, but we paid no attention to her, and i am not sure whether she turned her cab around to follow us or drove on home
a widely scattered mass of completely black houses was emerging from the paler darkness of the night
yes, mr miusov, you were the cause of my terrible fall
but at the moment it only added to my shame and embarrassment: they are looking at us from up there
for whom will man love then?
and the painting must be big as they come, do not forget
how could anybody help liking you?
the day the mother embraces the man who had her son torn to pieces by the hounds, the day those three stand side by side and say, you were right, o lord,  that day we will at last have attained the supreme knowledge and everything will be explained and accounted for
the monks would have objected
now you’re just talking nonsense and i don’t know what you mean by it, he said quietly but threateningly
i exclaimed in some kind of a trance, my eyes sparkling wildly
god wants to warn us, they said, and to many this argument seemed irrefutable
well, it was certainly not through any fault of mine: all i could tell in her presence, i told well and eloquently
and lise too will start despising me soon
nothing would make me leave!
others do not devote poems to them, but they can’t look at them without inner commotion
please sit down, we are all friends here
the whole thing turned into a real comedy!
i felt an irresistible urge for exercise
i am ready, and now we can get it over with very quickly because—listen to me—since i now know that i’m not guilty, we can certainly finish it up in a few minutes, can’t we?
they remembered that, then, they had put ice on his head and, since there was still some ice in the cellar, martha did the same now
katya, mitya suddenly asked her, did you believe i killed him?
i must make it clear from the outset that i feel unable to give a really complete account of all that happened during the trial or, for that matter, to report the events in their proper sequence
perhaps i am already in a madhouse
he was not really worried by his father’s order that he move back home, mattress, pillow, and all—he understood very well that a command shouted out like that was just his father’s way of showing off and enjoying the sheer beauty of the gesture
but what's coming over me now?
i did not want to tell him that they had not let me come near him
but secretly he was very eager to meet alyosha as there appeared to be something very attractive and interesting about him, to judge from all the stories
in that case, i could see and touch the money, and i could not deny its existence, which is very different from the case at hand
we need her badly because it is thanks to her meekness that god tolerates us and, without her constant angelic kindness, our house would have become a real hell; she makes us all gentler, even barbara
but before they got to him, makar, pushing hard on his crutch, had managed to raise himself and was looking around with a triumphant and laughing expression
and of you, mother, i have a clear picture only during one second: they took me to church once to receive the sacrament and you picked me up so i could receive the host and kiss the chalice
he thought all these considerations might bring pressure to bear upon the elder from within the monastery
why, if she said to him: i want nothing to do with your father
exhausted, she closed her eyes and seemed to doze off for a minute
in his words and in the inflections of his rather strident voice could be detected a sort of cracked, fool’s humor, now wicked, now timorous, never maintaining the same tone and constantly breaking off
what’s the matter, lise, have you gone quite mad?
oh, how inquisitive you are yourself, rakitin
allow me to kiss your hand once more!
i love those sticky little leaves in the spring and the blue sky, that’s what!
at one point he passed very close to his father’s house, as he crossed the yard of a little old house with four windows that stood next to karamazov’s property
including the coffin, the burial, the doctor, the flowers, and the money given to the carpenter's wife, i would say, all told, it came to about thirty rubles
then it suddenly dawned on him that where he really wanted to go was to old karamazov’s house, to find out whether anything had happened there
i raised myself and looked up
they were dumbfounded by me now
it’s a fact that i misbehave this way because i’m oversensitive
but where on earth did you get all this stuff from?
i did not have the courage
and how could i explain to my boy why i accepted your money for having been disgraced!
he hired ordinary russian workers, who came with their spades, and he made them dig a deep hole just by the edge of the stone
but from the very outset of his legal career, this sickly man had been unable to command the respect due his talents, and he never managed to close this gap later
why, there have been so many ideas in the history of man, ideas that would have seemed inconceivable ten years before, but that suddenly took root and flourished when, by some mysterious process, the time was ripe for them—and they quickly swept the earth
it happened quite recently and it gave me a great deal of trouble
what use would you be to me if you already had propensities for ruthlessness?
i got to vasin's house, which was in fontanka near the semyonovsky bridge, exactly at noon, but he was out
and that's why innumerable papas may repeat for centuries on end those two magic key words of the secret without managing to produce another james rothschild
but there were no lines around her big, wide-open eyes, from which shone a quiet and gentle light, eyes that had drawn me to her from the very first day
i felt utterly embarrassed
her young heart, which had perhaps once contained much that was good, was thus very early in life filled with angry resentment
no, after all, i can’t stand you!
wait, i’ll get it out of the cupboard
you’re really just like the rest of them
how many souls, for instance, had to be destroyed, how many reputations ruined for the sake of the righteous job, over whom i was so utterly swindled long ago!
however, it still remains unclear to me why, instead of devoting himself to the poor imbecile, he did not give a thought to my mother, who was waiting for him in konigs-berg
as a rule, the monks gathered in the elder’s cell in the evening just before they separated for the night, and each monk confessed aloud the sins he had committed that day, his sinful desires, his thoughts and temptations, and also his quarrels with his brother monks, if there had been any
the world beyond’ and material proof—a peculiar combination that only men would think up!
they’ll pray for him there
i never expected we could quarrel about this!
before we would driven a quarter of the way to lambert's, i heard my name called out behind me
they had never spoken to each other, but somehow he had long felt that the old seducer, now a dying man, would not object to grushenka’s settling down to an honest life and marrying a reliable man
where is she then?
is that what you mean, mother?
t do not care how expensive it is!
this immediately attracts me to people, only up to a point of course
ah, lise, don’t scream like that
fenya came in with the uncorked bottle of champagne and three glasses on a tray
still, eventually the baby was not sent off to a foundling home
and, really, versilov is
where are you going?
there were many stern and frowning faces, some of them outright hostile
go on, why don’t you say that too?
that was what maxim skotoboinikov had to say about the afimievsk people and, although it was not kind what he said, there was truth in it: they were an unreliable lot and could not control themselves
he watched her with boundless admiration as she sipped champagne from her glass
and when he said that, he got up and left
later there was a fire in the village of voskova—that's downstream from the town—and nine houses burned down from top to bottom
i realize how stupid it would have been, but i suppose it was the sheer ecstasy of the moment
so i would like to know what it is you want
all i claim to know is that laughter is the most reliable gauge of human nature
the way you put it, it was as if i had the three thousand in my pocket
i’m pretty sure he’ll take it tomorrow, alyosha said, pacing the room, his face concentrated in thought
for how could god almighty treat a tartar, who was brought before him, like a christian?
the young woman cried out in sincere repentance when he was arrested
i know a lawyer in kursk province—i knew him when we were boys—and i have been assured by a reliable person that if i could get there, he would take me on as a clerk in his office
he’ll save me from him, save me forever
he actually felt reassured now that he was reasonably convinced that the murderer was his brother dmitry rather than smerdyakov, although it would seem more reasonable for him to have been more upset
they found it only later in the morning, vasin explained
arkady is searching for beauty, i suddenly hear anna's voice coming from somewhere close by
i am sincerely fond of men and in many respects i’ve been slandered
alyosha followed him for a while with his eyes, unable to believe that his brother would leave him like that
besides, he’s no longer an army officer—he’s been working for the customs office in siberia lately, somewhere on the chinese border, i believe, just a lousy little polack customs official
i suffered because of her, and she did her best to torment me
all monday and tuesday i heard him singing in his room the bridegroom cometh, and i enjoyed both the tune and the verses tremendously
perkhotin’s surprise grew when he saw a whole wad of bills in dmitry’s hand
i’d just like to share a small observation with you, ivan answered immediately, namely, that for a long time european liberals and even our native russian liberal dilettantes have frequently confused the final results of socialism and of christianity
you were right, trishatov!
it was this that gregory had mentioned when mr karamazov and ivan were sitting at table
there is no knowledge that could supply them with bread as long as they remain free
there was nothing so unusual in his taking money from me, grushenka said, smiling in contemptuous disgust
as katerina had thought, alyosha did not get there in time
well, of course, i took only one detail out of the whole picture but, as you know, every detail is compositionally connected with all the others by indestructible links
the time came to carry the coffin out, but snegirev would not budge from it
even though sin and injustice and temptation are all around us, we know that there is on this earth a holy man, a saint who is just and knows the truth, and this means that truth and justice have not vanished from the earth and so will come to us too and rule over all the world, as has been promised
and what could smerdyakov have possibly told her?
but i’ll come to that later, although it is what concerns me most of all
we’ll be waiting for you, he concluded firmly, and left the house
a nightingale was singing in a moscow cafe when a merchant walked in
for that’s your way of praying to god, and watching you makes me happy and in my happiness i pray for you too, which means that both of us are praying to the same god
there was a sudden wave of sympathy for mitya
he hurried over there, hoping to get the business out of the way quickly so that he wouldn’t be late visiting mitya in prison
oh, not my mother and sister—them, i would never abandon, however things turned out
i’m terribly sorry
i won’t get into trouble for it there
so i could weep and i wept for their old idea, and, indeed, i may have actually wept real tears and i am not saying this just to be dramatic
it does not to you because you just had dinner
so those who think they do not need god are really just idol worshipers, and that's what we should call them
even before i was questioned then, i had been told what had happened when he was arrested and how he had accused smerdyakov
but, instead, the door opened and in came an unexpected visitor—daria, the mother of the girl who had hanged herself
you’re not at all like my alyosha—when he looks at me, his eyes beam
it’s a pretty tricky question!
i would been waiting for you these past three days, i suddenly heard myself blurting out
and he told her everything: how he had been sent to their father’s to get the money from him, how dmitry had broken into the house, how he had given his father a brutal beating, and how, after that, he had again reminded alyosha to go to see her—katerina—and give her his regards
why shouldn’t my servant be like one of the family?
smurov, walking beside him, kept looking back at the shouting group behind
the question is, then, whether this is because people are bad or because that is their nature
he started realizing his 'idea' by stealing money at a roulette table
allow me to explain the following point to you
'perhaps you know how to get that stone out of here?
it was just a joke
she’s an angel, katerina cried, her tone suddenly acquiring extraordinary warmth
all right, all right
but, in reality, she has no right to accuse my client of betraying her, because it was she who betrayed him!
the first time after the murder that he had seen and spoken to him was on the very day of his arrival
no, sir, she wouldn’t even let me look at it from a distance
and, it turned out, it affected me too
he could have bled to death, mother!
he's going off somewhere again, zverev said
so go now, and love ivan!
what if i say: even if he were there, hence nothing
mitya stood up, looking intently at his brother with a strange, wild, contorted smile
of course, nothing prevents a mystic or a fanatic from having red cheeks
it was too painful for me to see him in that state
as it turned out, my childhood friend lambert belonged to one of those gangs of small-time crooks that go in for what is defined as blackmail by the criminal code, which also specifies the appropriate penalties
alyosha believed that implicitly
at that moment, every woman among them had no doubt whatever that our prosecutor had been crushed so thoroughly that he would never recover
all sorts of extraordinary stories circulated about her passionate love for mitya, even after he had committed the crime
i’m surprised at you
in general, he was eccentric, even whimsical, although always pleasant and warm
your eyes look so peculiar
she was holding his hand and seemed to be laughing, while he was saying something in a very loud voice, without looking at her, to maximov, who sat across the table from him
so, while the episode with the former university student showed that my idea was capable of blurring the messages my brain received from my senses, the episode with the baby arina showed just the opposite—namely, that no idea could capture a man (at least me) so completely as to enable him to ignore something overwhelmingly moving and to prevent him from sacrificing to it the results of years of effort directed toward the realization of his idea
if i were the defender, i would have said straight out, he killed him but he is not guilty, and the hell with all the rest!
what peeves me most, in fact, is that by describing my own adventures with such emotion, i give the impression that i am still the same person as i was in those days
but tell me, isn’t there such a thing as legal action?
you’ll be here for many months and years yet
and, in general, i had stumbled upon these people at a very bad moment: i was vibrating with exuberance and joy while each of them was preoccupied with his own troubles, and very serious ones
ah, so it’s you, rakitin!
it's one of those awful, shameless patriotic tall tales!
why, what have i done?
i know how miserable he is about it now, and if he's stopped washing, it's out of sheer despair
children, as long as they are young, say seven years old, for instance, are very different from adults—entirely different creatures, totally unlike adults in their very essence
persons unknown to you
i shouted, no, you do not understand—you see, there was a certain manuscript
i cried, surprised beyond belief
what’s the matter, trifon?
he was sitting on a bench and writing something in a notebook with a pencil
you know, i always try to ignore all that, but there's something serious brewing today
the three-room cottage she lived in was rented furnished, and the furniture was of old, red mahogany in the unfashionable style of the ’s
i was basing myself on what dmitry had told me
you haven’t a kopek to your name
anyway, i have had enough of this!
i mean that if i’m still in town tomorrow (which is extremely unlikely, for i expect to leave today) and if we happen to meet, i don’t want to even mention any of these topics, not a word
and i want you to note that, during the two hours i had been playing before, the zero had never come up so that no one was even staking on it any more
it was hard to tell whether he was still fooling or was now really deeply moved
i agree that he was weak physically and that his health was poor
she had succeeded in convincing someone or other to let her into the courtroom again before the prosecutor and the defense counsel made their speeches
what do you think you’re doing?
i did not believe him at first
there was still enough daylight for them to see my pale face and trembling figure
here, mr karamazov, here’s your hat; let me get my own cap, and let us be on our way
i loved you because you are so generous
there she could scrub the floors, weed the vegetable garden, heat the bathhouse, while still keeping an eye on her baby and the other four children who ran around outside the buildings in their little shirts
the next day, at dawn, the general rode out to the hunt in full dress, surrounded by his obsequious neighbors, hounds, kennel attendants, huntsmen, every one of them on horseback
besides, you have no need of my forgiveness and i have no need of yours
and while i myself am perfectly lucid and reasonable, my double wants to do something incongruous, sometimes something extremely funny
i am a mother, you know, and i will
when they reached him, he was already writhing on the cellar floor at the foot of the steps, his body twisted by convulsions, his mouth frothing
trishatov had rushed for a doctor, but versilov came to before the doctor arrived
isn’t that so, von sohn?
of course, i was not intentionally eavesdropping on them, i simply could not prevent myself from listening when i saw how much the news of the arrival of that woman affected my mother
i feel drawn into the streets, into the blackness
all these friendly, nice faces that usually radiate love for me are now inaccessible and, if i become the tiniest bit too noisy, too playful, i know i will be ordered out of the room
just as suddenly, the old lieutenant colonel became very sick and was unable to leave the house for two days, so he couldn’t hand over the government funds
this is really something!
ivan said with a grin
i see nothing wrong with putting it that way, vasin said, still puzzled
just as he has created god, in that case
he asked in the same tone
however, although he had waited for kolya to act of his own accord, he had sent smurov to him a couple more times to ask whether he would not talk to alyosha after all
and now, gentlemen, i beg you to wait here a minute while i announce you
as to children leaving their parents to find their own nests, you could read about that in the bible
sit down, mitya, and tell me what you’ve been trying to say
a vicious woman like me needs to pray
well, perhaps there was nothing in him to inspire respect
he was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes when he was alone with another person, he would suddenly become talkative, effusive, and was liable to burst out laughing quite unaccountably
now kolya’s crazy act seemed to have improved dardanelov’s standing, and, because of his efforts on the boy’s behalf, he was made to understand that there might be some hope for him after all, although as yet a very remote hope
whenever that happened, he would leave her in the care of auntie tatyana prutkov, who would always turn up when he needed her
i’ll open all your letters and read them—i might as well warn you now
ivan continued in the same whisper, his mouth crooked with spite
that was two days ago
mitya’s grandfather, that is, adelaida’s father, mr miusov, was no longer alive; his widow, mitya’s grandmother, had moved to moscow and was in very poor health; and, in the meantime, adelaida’s sisters had married and moved away
ilyusha was so completely dumbfounded when he heard that that i thought perhaps i’d overdone it a bit
what does that word mean?
but, damn it, what the hell is there to make you so sure that you’ll have an epileptic fit just then?
ivan cried out in wide-eyed amazement, staring at smerdyakov as if in awe
just write that iou
he was unconscious and all covered with blood
forgive me, oh great elder—i made up that last bit about diderot’s being baptized as i was telling the story
then she started cleaning up the room
i felt i owed him no explanations or apologies, for i resented the fact that someone like ivan should suspect me of still being in love with that
that i can’t say, sir, but i think she’s gone to join some officer who sent for her from there
so, from now on, consider we don’t know each other—and this is for good
i don’t know yet
so i decided to wait for you here: you were bound to come this way, since there’s no other way to get to the monastery
who told you he would been dismissed?
he was about my height
this is no longer ultramontanism, this is arch-ultramontanism!
the six windows giving onto the street were brightly lighted
he was walking very fast, as though hurrying somewhere
everybody writes like that these days,  rakitin told me, because the environment demands it
why, old gregory used to carry me in his arms when i was little
we ate it, le grand dadais growled
he doesn’t seem to be in much of a state to discuss business right now
and this is what i was able to make out of his explanations
he even had moments of depression during which he threatened to resign his post and become a defense counsel
and while they’re at it, let them also bring up some brandy and red and white wine—just like that other time
he thought intently for a moment
as to my mysterious and constant visitor, i was filled with tremendous admiration for him, for, beyond being enthralled by his intellectual powers, i vaguely felt that he was nurturing certain plans within him and that he was preparing something very important
did he really want to shoot her at that moment?
is he all right?
well, you can go to hell then!
i will get her for you, from the entrails of the earth if i have to!
these eyes, themselves rather small and unexpressive, were set exceptionally close together, divided only by the very thin bone of his long, slender nose
so she walked up to the apartment and asked for the lady
that’s good enough, fine!
did you really come or did i just dream it up or invent it all in my imagination?
i remember only too well the sad and painful feeling that kept tugging at my heart during those hours at the table
alyosha muttered, crossing himself and drifting into peaceful sleep
where can you possibly have found such a tailor around here?
and on top of that, she had suddenly announced that she too had been to see smerdyakov!
but once they have paid this tribute, i say to them: you have asked for it, you bastards, so it serves you right
i certainly won’t ask him about back-scrubbers
just before i would come in, the doctor had given him a pretty thorough examination
you know how a schoolboy grills a new classmate
don’t keep telling me that
but wait a minute, perkhotin said in a worried tone, watching dmitry uneasily
you understand, pine’ and to pine’—although actually she said it somewhat differently—i’m a bit confused
he was about twenty-six, spare, blond, above average in height, with a serious and at the same time gentle look
for a whole month, i kept repeating it all over town
and he started peppering smerdyakov with the kind of questions the man had just complained about to ivan—all about the lady visitor he was waiting for—questions that we will omit here
and i will say this of servants too
it was completely dark now and peter came in with candles
now, one hour later, she threw herself at julia’s feet and kissed them
she's horrid, she's scheming, you must not trust her
avoid fear too, although fear is really only a consequence of lies
please let me in!
but you can already see those sunken cheeks and those wrinkles on her forehead, and that frightened, timid look—all these traits that have now been accentuated by the years and are growing even more pronounced as time goes by
i should have asked you for twenty-five rubles really
now he sat motionless and he did not notice when he dozed off; then he fell asleep as he sat there
tell me, if you know so much
i needed the money very badly, but my decision was final
i commented and could not help laughing
who sewed it in like that?
she looked at him in frightened perplexity, but after she took the flowers, color brightened her pale cheeks and joy gleamed in her eyes
see those two branches?
it contained crayon and watercolor sketches of temples on mountain sides, of cupids, of a lake with swans on it, and also some verses such as:
when he heard that, the priest changed the subject, though it might have been kinder of him to have imparted to dmitry his suspicion—namely, that if samsonov had recommended the man to him only as the hound, either he must have done so as a joke or there must be something wrong somewhere
my life is coming to an end—i know it, hear it
you see, what happened is that i got myself deep in debt, like an idiot, and all i want is to win enough money to pay back what i owe
they will raze churches and flood the earth with blood, but the stupid children will finally realize themselves that, although they are rebels, they are weak and are unable to bear their own rebellion
i would never have imagined any such outburst from her
and what about the beautiful katerina?
ah, if only juchka could be there too, as well as the puppy, then he would be really happy!
they only irritated her
but it suddenly occurs to me that i have never heard you talk yet
you pride yourself on your chosen ones, but you have only the chosen, while we will bring peace of mind to all men
as i said, i was in some sort of trance, in a strange state of elation, but before i could finish mrs prutkov suddenly seized me by the hair with a quickness i would never have suspected her capable of and violently jerked my head down
imagine that—he was sure!
yes, i did, alyosha said
and he walked on without giving them back the house
but what did i find in that cell?
the handkerchief was soaked with blood
so dmitry, my boy, shall i tell her not to worry, that you’ll be calm now?
i rushed away from the window and started running toward the garden fence
when he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal, in satisfying his vices
he marched in with his long stride, looking straight ahead of him, and sat down, looking completely detached
there were two pots of flowers on the window sill and, in a corner, many icons, one of them a large picture of the mother of god probably painted long before the schism
that's a mother's heart for you!
i didn’t understand her at all then: i thought she wouldn’t come with me unless i had some money, that she would never accept me penniless
let’s drink that bottle here
i suppose you are laughing at my appearance
but the prince did not enjoy the landlord's company; indeed, the man only annoyed and revolted him; and somehow the prince felt more and more suspicious of the fellow
ah, that was a terrible misunderstanding and i am awfully sorry for what happened, mr dolgoruky, my dear an
none of us— i mean the people like myself—had anything to show for his efforts
i’m maria, she said
still, i could not restrain myself when i heard a middle-aged officer sitting in front of me mumble to his neighbor:
your mother is the most perfect and the most delightful creature
later, he vaguely recollected several men tearing her from him by force and leading her away
ivan stood there dumbfounded
no, no, i’m not
or do not you know i am a doctor and a male midwife?
yes, and on top of that, deep down in my heart, i am also guilty of
to hell with the oysters, perkhotin snapped almost spitefully
ever since sergei's arrest, there had been in poor lisa's attitude a sort of proud challenge, an inaccessible haughtiness that was almost unbearable
as soon as we were in each other's arms, he began to weep
he certainly would remember, however, the inexpressible sensations he experienced during his contemplation
why, instead of going out to meet them in the passage, i hid myself, i cannot say; it just happened like that, without any planning or thinking whatever
how could you allow a stupid young pup to talk so disrespectfully about his mother?
no, lise, there’s no contempt for him, alyosha said firmly, as if he’d been expecting that question
the bells jingled and i was dozing
smerdyakov took the book about isaac the syrian off the money and put it aside
it won’t take me more than two minutes if you will only let me talk, and i’ll explain the whole plan i wanted to present to you
i became acutely conscious of my complicity in this affair if i did nothing, and my irritation grew
you took three hundred rubles from the prince today
i just looked intently into the faces of those around me and tried to guess what i needed to know
his face twitched slightly
i was about to once, but i couldn’t do it
i won’t go on if you don’t want me to
that's not honorable at all, my friend, especially since your mother has nothing to reproach herself for: she's a woman of the highest respectability and if she's not called mrs versilov to this day, it's only because she's still married to another man
but why, why, did you suspect me of such desires, then?
what i like about this, the visitor said, is that from the very start we’ve addressed each other with complete familiarity
ah, alyosha, you aren’t in love with me at all, not in the least!
he craved that renewal and regeneration
it was a fateful moment for me
yes, quite—is he a cavalryman then?
you saw it, did you?
i soon got bored and my ears became inured to the whispering; although i kept listening, i did so mechanically, sometimes forgetting that i was listening and not taking the words in
from pale, his face had turned red, almost purple, and every feature in it was quivering and twitching
didn’t you know that already?
he was still very annoyed with himself
without thinking i seized his hand, almost fervently (i often act impulsively like that and my room was almost completely dark)
i lived near the voznesensky bridge in a huge block of flats
she made the sign of the cross over him three times and saw him off to the door
i’m sure you disagree again, karamazov?
oh, you can bet on it, boy
there are some people like that, my friends, and there should be
his family had even announced in the newspapers that they would not be held responsible for his debts
right, right, let's drop it; in fact, i would be glad to forget the whole business if it were possible
anna, please give him some tea, il prend toujours par les sentiments!
there he increased the sum by borrowing three rubles from his landlord and his wife, who gave it to him gladly, although it was all they had, because they had such great affection for their lodger
indeed, it seemed the old man was anxious to tell his son something and he had come out into the living room especially to meet him
a girl may weigh the merits of her suitor, there's no crime in that
no, no, it is quite out of the question!
he had been thinking during the whole month that such an object could be used as a weapon, so he recognized and accepted it as such the very second he saw it!
during my wanderings i met my former orderly afanasy, in the provincial town of k i had not seen him for eight years
in fact, i too had had some dealings with him in the past month and, for certain reasons, i was rather surprised to see him walk in that day
is this really your conviction about what would happen if men lost their faith in the immortality of the soul?
then i said gott der heilige geist,  and he tried to repeat as much of it as he could, laughing all the time
just as i expected, i did not find out quite everything i wanted from you, i said
there were seven men and three women in a room that seemed rather small for ten people
or do you think we will be deceiving them?
nevertheless, she is all there, our old mother russia; we can smell her!
it’s doing this in front of the mothers that particularly arouses their senses
their only secret is their godlessness, and your inquisitor’s only secret is that he doesn’t believe in god, that’s all!
let me add that, in my opinion, writing in russian is more difficult than in any other european language
but now,  he says, with smerdyakov dead, who will believe your story when you tell it in court?
je parle comme une dame russe sur les eaux minerales, le grand dadais answered, still holding his neck stretched out
he was just a simple monk with no priestly rank
smerdyakov slowly raised his head and looked at ivan through the glasses
what do you say, do you think he would?
he is not in love with katerina, alyosha said with assurance
i know, though, that in the end i’ll reconcile myself, complete my quadrillion too, and learn the secret
they don’t care about saving their souls
when she saw it, she flew to him impetuously, seized him by the hands, almost forced him to sit down on his cot, and sat down close by him, never letting go of his hands and pressing them spasmodically
i won’t answer it because the answer would dishonor me
but the way she tore into me!
my heart was sinking and when i tried to say something to the driver, the words would not come out right and sounded like incoherent mumbling
he said aloud in hysterical rapture
however, i must mention something essential: tatyana prutkov, my sincere and loving friend, keeps pestering me every day, insisting that i should now enter the university
we were interrupted by a footman who appeared in the doorway
she waited, watching me in silence
i’m so glad you’re here too, he said to him
vasin smiled and told me that he remembered it by heart anyway
gives the insects sensual lust
he seemed stunned and was breathing with difficulty
i told you that out of sheer kindness
damn it, can’t you search me like this?
so you knew very well where the envelope was hidden
but to get back to our subject, let me tell you that your mother does occasionally break her silence, but whenever she does express her opinion on something, it at once becomes obvious that it was a waste of time trying to enlighten her, even if you would spent five years explaining that particular point to her
well, that’s how it is, and after this, let it be according to god’s will
you can be sure that i will come back to you some day—in that sense, for me you are
you’re too stupid, really, too hopelessly stupid, ivan said cantankerously
the cowl was left open, but the face was covered by a black veil
the pretty boy trishatov, who until then had been silent and brooding, asked me, holding up his glass across the table
i also felt very curious, for i guessed that there was a secret weighing on him
ah, cher enfant, it was such a noble, such an honorable, gesture that even kilyan—that was the name of the scribe in the downstairs office—even he was completely flabbergasted!
i was silent, concentrated, attentive, and frightfully calculating; i was patient and stingy, although also resolute at critical moments
he’s her man, mr karamazov
hurry, go to the prison or it will be closed
but before reaching it, he stopped and said, looking at grushenka:
what have i done to you?
you certainly like to take your precautions!
he was a real father to me!
but he forgot her and married someone else
he said now in a quite different voice
are you angry with someone?
the old man was telling that cockeyed tale about me, but he knows nothing about this
of the world in grim travail,
now let me tell you this, i cried out, suddenly losing all patience
dr herzenstube comes to see him every day
why do not they come to me frankly and openly?
but, as you must know, the greater the power, the more frightening is the responsibility of wielding it!
even if i do not believe in the divine order of things, the sticky young leaves emerging from their buds in the spring are dear to my heart; so is the blue sky and so are some human beings, even though i often don’t know why i like them; i may still even admire an act of heroism with my whole heart, perhaps out of habit, although i may have long since stopped believing in heroism
he was very touched to see the almost tender concern all these recent enemies now showed for him
have you been at home with your family, and did you see your brother?
mitya lowered his eyes
i didn’t want you to go to moscow, mr ivan, because if you were in chermashnya, you wouldn’t be so far away
perhaps because the other fellow doesn’t smell right, or because he has a stupid face, or because once upon a time he may have stepped on his toe
this was something unprecedented, something absolutely astounding, even for a strong-willed, proud, and haughty person like her, for who could have expected such a complete confession and self-indictment!
i requested it most insistently
this is my answer: you may think you have heard all that before, but you have not heard a thing yet
and job, when he praises the lord, serves not only him but his whole creation, for generations and generations, forever and ever, for that is what he was foreordained to do
you see, i know very well he hates me, just as he hates everybody, including you, even though you have the impression that he thinks highly of you
in russia our poet tyuchev, believing deeply in the truth of his words, wrote:
i won’t let them, though
speak clearly, don’t hurry and, above all, don’t leave anything out
to that i can only reply that he now viewed grushenka’s past as non-existent
he seemed paralyzed with fear
perhaps ever since ivan had come to know katerina?
she’s still in her wheelchair, isn’t she?
and i would advise you too, alyosha, never to worry about these matters, least of all about god—whether he exists or not
at the same time, i will have to confess something that i am horribly ashamed of
a monk whispered into alyosha’s ear that rakitin had just arrived from town and wanted to see him
and all the money they stole from him—they didn’t give him receipts for it, so we’d never know how much it was
and why has he forgotten everything?
but what would happen if the enemy attacked us?
i suddenly announced with great emphasis
i don’t really have to go into all that, for i didn’t create the world, and i’m not responsible for it
no, that i could never bear—i’ll kill myself if he does that!
no, no, i do not want to hear what you have to say!
grushenka then felt sorry for her first love and in the evening went to pay the poles a visit
in the house, you know, where you were put to bed, well, they would not let him in  in fact, he was given a rather peculiar reception
i did it right in front of his eyes, and although he didn’t seem to believe me before, as soon as he heard the signal, he immediately ran to the door and opened it
that it was her perdition, my mother must have understood soon enough, although when she first went to him i doubt that she even gave it a thought
but you cannot apologize in the course of the duel, my second shouted at me angrily
and now she felt as if she had leaped into an abyss
better siberia than your love, katya, for i love another woman, and i know that you got to know her only too well today, so i don’t expect you can ever forgive us
but although he had not said much on that occasion, alyosha had seen and understood a good deal
as he started to answer, alyosha suddenly gave a start, as though he had just remembered and understood something
she had recurring fits of hysterics for days on end
but i don’t think there is any need for you to go into that any further, or any obligation for me to answer such questions, because it is all my private concern
but it’s so strange the way you can tell things in advance
it was as if the threads of all those innumerable worlds of god had met in his soul and his soul was vibrating from its contact with different worlds
the moon was shining brightly
that is really very hard to believe
it was probably to avoid such remarks and comments that father ferapont was allowed to do as he pleased
i should have put my foot down right away and i had not done it
here, kiss me now, i want you to
no german papa can muster such will power
i remember him apologizing and mentioning someone called anna
but while still in moscow, i had already decided to postpone the real beginning of my effort until i became completely independent
well, demidov brought it to him, as an honest man: there will be a search of my place tomorrow,  demidov told him
and he gave me a pretty good idea at the very start of what this purpose was
all right, my boy, i concede in advance the absurdity of it all, including the crying on his shoulder, which i told you about myself and which you are now using against me, thus taking undue advantage of my trustingness and confidence
and another voice said: no, don’t shout!
unfortunately, just at that moment, my mind was completely preoccupied with a stupid idea, and i just shrugged in disgust, got up, and left the table, letting him keep the ten rubles
miss anna is so sorry for prince sergei!
oh, if you want a piece of good advice, never allow a conceited, envious man to see a large sum of money in your hand!
they were completely engrossed in what they were doing
i only examined out of the corner of my eye her old, dark overcoat, her rough hands (almost the hands of a working woman), her heavy shoes, her face that had grown very thin, and the first wrinkles that had already appeared on her forehead
the useless worm will crawl on the earth for the last time, and disappear!
i’ll go and give that boy a good hiding!
prince, i request that you immediately pay me the fifty rubles you owe me for one month of my services, i blurted out all in one breath and with an irritation verging on rudeness
i almost threw my arms around vasin
anyway, seeing them only makes it worse
he leaped to his feet and shouted: it was smerdyakov who killed him, it was smerdyakov!
see, over there, sitting and waiting under that wooden gallery
if you need money, i can give you some, for you, you can always count on me
he was quickly led out amidst the laughter of the audience
alyosha was surprised, never having expected that this face could glow with such sincere warmth
first of all, let’s have some coffee!
in a different part of the town ivan had a very comfortable apartment in the wing of a house belonging to the well-to-do widow of a civil servant
she’s wrong about your being crazy, but she’s right that you’re not well, alyosha said
i mean, have you ever stolen someone else’s money straight out of his pocket or purse
and you say she went home from there?
that impression flashed like a red streak among the painful, sorrowful thoughts that were churning in alyosha’s head
his face suddenly became very grave and he declared that the baby must immediately be sent to a foundling home
the monks, although their expressions did not change, waited tensely to hear what the elder would say, and seemed ready to leap to their feet like miusov
oh, i understand why the simple people love you
a sudden change came over him: instead of the solemn, tragic look he had worn when he came in, his expression became that of a small child
do you recognize this object?
nothing would calm the old man now—he had reached the dangerous line of drunkenness beyond which some drinkers, peaceful until then, deliberately try to lose their tempers and to assert themselves
i only hope it won’t entail loss of civil rights, will it, mr prosecutor?
the story about the goose pleased him no end
that was long ago—five years or so
why are you blushing then?
but i swear i have no doubts about his gift of feeling anguish for europe's turmoils and in my eyes that capacity in itself is infinitely more important than any kind of practical competence put to use in such modern activities as, say, the construction of railroads
not to mention the fact that i still do not quite understand what you are actually reproaching me for
i will always have my idea at my side!
bandaged now, it’s all aflame
you see, i’ve wanted to tell you many things since i’ve been behind these leprous walls, but i felt i couldn’t bring up the most important thing; i felt the time hadn’t come yet
he did not give up his drinking bouts, but now she would watch over him during those days and try to cure him of this habit
this was particularly hard for gregory, who loved children and was not ashamed to show it
i won’t keep you long; in fact, i won’t bother to take my coat off
she too kept her coat on, a rather shabby one, on top of which she had tied an odd piece of material as a scarf, and on her head was something that looked like a rain hat, old and battered, which certainly did not help her looks any
i screamed, beside myself, glaring at everyone around me
and the counsel goes on to put straight the gospels and established religion as a whole
his shoulders were broad and one could guess that he was very tall; even though he was sick, pale, and emaciated, and his face was long and drawn, he still seemed quite strong and cheerful
and this is just such as case, he said, for the very first newspaper reports suggested something to me that was very much in favor of the accused
we have something
but after it, the sick man could have regained consciousness
i don’t want any lemonade, ivan said, and we’ll talk about me later
this time his features were no longer twisted and his clownish expression had vanished
it was not just that he did not believe me, she said, lowering her eyes and smiling strangely, but he decided that i had all the vices
nevertheless you still wish to keep one thousand for yourself?
but soon the surprised expression on his face changed to a smile which grew increasingly sarcastic
even if i did nothing in europe but roam around (and i knew that was all i was going to do), the fact that i carried with me my russian idea and my russian view of the world was a sufficient contribution in itself
this is something i know, if i know anything
mother was listening, tense with alarm
the little pole lighted his pipe again and prepared to deal
and try not to scare anna either, for i love her too and you are unfair to her because you ca not understand her; if she's embittered, it's because; she's been neglected since her early child hood
your bloodstained hands
hell, if i hadn’t pulled him off, i suppose he’d have killed him—how much more could the old fool take
i don’t expect it was to cut my throat secretly, or was it?
of course, i thanked him for the poem and he seemed very flattered
you must surely have heard of me?

the hostess herself, her brother justus and his wife, and little therese weichbrodt were all well past sixty; while old frau consul buddenbrook, uncle gotthold's widow, born sliiwing, as well aa madame kethelsen, now, alas almost entirely deaf, were already in the seventies

his wife, who had given a sign to ida jungmann, held him back
but it is only fair to say one thing: i was just a child when i was married, a perfect goose, a silly little thing
the servants and the poor folk had had their presents and gone; ida jung-mann was chattering with riekchen severin in the hall--al-though generally, as a governess, she preserved a proper dis-tance between herself and the frau consul's maid--the lights of the great tree were burnt down and extinguished, the mon-ger was in darkness

lle deliberately brought to kretschmar unfinished things in order to be told what he knew already, then to laugh at the ar- tistic sense, the connoisseurship, of his teacher, which entirely co- incided with his own: the understanding which is the actual agent of the work-idea - not the idea of a particular work but the idea of the opus itself, the objective and harmonic creation complete, the manager of its unified organic nature; which sticks the cracks together, stops up the holes, brings out that natural flow - which was not there in the first place and so is not nat- ural at all, but a product of art - in short, only in retrospect and indirectly does this manager produce the impression of the spon- taneous and organic

unwilling to make him out as either better or worse than he really was, we feel bound to mention that the wretched wehsal, one evening when they were alone, prayed him, with pallid lips, for the love of god to tell him what had taken place after the mardi gras festivities, and hans castorp had good-naturedly complied, without, as the reader may imagine, introducing any wanton or flippant element into his recital

on the other hand, the quickening of the sense of time will flow out beyond the interval and reassert itself after the return to ordinary existence: the first days at home after the holiday will be lived with a broader flow, freshly and youthfully—but only the first few, for one adjusts oneself more quickly to the rule than to the exception; and if the sense of time be already weakened by age, or—and this is a sign of low vitality—it was never very well developed, one drowses quickly back into the old life, and after four-and-twenty hours it is as though one had never been away, and the journey had been but a watch in the night

it could never be popular; and the church, accordingly, had at all times been unpopular
near their destination was a beautiful view of a rocky stretch of the zügenstrasse
whether he had actually lived, settembrini said, was uncertain; yet his time had given birth to an idea, which had continued its triumphant course even up to to-day: the idea of the dignity of the human spirit, the idea of equality—in a word, they were celebrating the birth of individualistic democracy, and to it he would empty the glass they gave him
thy plaintive anthem fades
his black cravat showed wear, and he wore no cuffs, as hans castorp saw at once from the lax way the sleeve hung round the wrist
for although he was at bottom glad that settembrini, after all that had passed, continued, as he did, still to talk to him, admonishing, instructing, seeking to establish an influence upon his mind, yet his understanding had reached the point where he was critical of the italian’s words, and at times, up to a point, withheld his assent
i will speak to the bathing-master early to-morrow morning, when he comes to my room
but now i have something else in mind, went on tony
the names at the end of the alphabet had lately been called in the ovid class, and presumably they would begin again at the beginning
lie knew well what would happen
he, behrens, must think it over
he could feel a few grains of sand from the beach, still inside his buttoned boot--how lovely!
the harsh, imperious call reaches the spirit on that remote path that leads into the shadows, the coolness and peace
yet it did seem to him rather premature to begin thinking about christmas even before the advent season, six weeks at least before the holiday!
he saw not only the unerring charm which his father exer-cised upon everybody: he saw as well, with strange and  d anguished penetration, how cruelly hard it was upon him
but even as i spoke i seemed to myself unspeakably fatu- ous; and even vorse, he saw it too, apparently shared my view, and felt ashamed on my account
this gently animated quiet filled little johann with a priceless sensation: the feeling of quiet, well-cared-for, elegant repose which was the atmosphere of the resort, and which he loved better than any-thing else
tony was in no state to share his feelings
first the covers were spread, one after the other, over the chair, so that a sizable piece hung down at the foot
yes, thomas, you have very little under-standing for that sort of thing, and it's my misfortune, per-haps, that i have so much
you don’t seem to, he went on, as hans castorp continued to stare at the bizarre little instrument
he returns my bow, half gets up, finishes the last lines of a letter; then he turns to me and be-gins to talk business, looking over the top of my head
he rubbed his free hands with satisfaction and looked at the frau consul out of his kindly, light-blue eyes
his neighbour avoided contact with him
behrens asked, and fixed him with his bloodshot eyes
the hofrat said to hans castorp: castorp, old cock, you’re bored
the port of cherbourg, we could confidently trust, had been put out of com- mission by the skill of german engineers; but it surrendered after a heroic radiogram to the fuhrer from the commandant as well as the admiral
her case aptly illustrates the general mood
she should have said beforehand that she was no good to play such a game, if she had the advantage of being whispered to
so it is not possible to say that herr settembrini condemned war as such
as for settembrini, he had more than once announced his intention of changing
there vias a hasty pencilled note to her betrothed, with the words: je t'aime
yes, tom, she said, and blinked with her tear-reddened eyes, i will be good now; i am already
it’s a very simple matter,  to use his own words
enough for to-day, enough for a whole day, i should think
- its atmosphere, a little mad and quite armless; the dec- orative appeal to the senses, the holiday and artistic mood of this self-satisfied capua: all that was of course foreign to the soul of a deep, stern nature like his
dr faustus  i: if you could just keep quiet, prating jackanapes that you are!
to the point even that he was quite capable of bringing up all three as objects of his conscientious scruples!
then he set store by rivalry and social jealousy: would tell how he had been at such and such houses, yesterday at the lange- wiesches', or whoever his friends were; or at the rollwagens', who had the two thoroughbred daughters (it always upsets me just to hear that word)
well, and salt water would naturally make a tender skin smart, so he got in the way, in the service, of rubbing in cold cream
this statement was almost as improbable as it was objectionable; but frau stöhr swore to it by all that was holy—though it was hard to understand how the poor creature could expend so much zeal and energy, and be so dogmatic, upon matters like these, when her own personal condition gave so much cause for concern
well, he said to himself, i will go over to quisisana for a bit
no, as far as knowing goes, we never can
the consul would have been nai have indeed had he not realized that the good standing of his own firm was to the advantage of his son-in-law
he never got further than being subdeacon—not even to diaconate, much less to priesthood
he was quite capable of getting out of an omnibus or train when there 'were germans in it
i can rely very ,veil on my memory, and besides i com- mitted much of it to paper at once after reading the draft, and in particular this about apostasy
a mingled odour of cologne and drugs hung in the mild, dim-lighted atmosphere
it's so little trouble that even so the pleasure might be greater
they were named gerhardt, and asserted that they descended in a direct line from paul gerhardt
oh, no, of course i don’t mean you really have—i suppose it just seemed so to me for the moment, hans castorp hastened to assure him
hans castorp broke in here
she is very luxuriously inclined, herr gr� said ir-ritably
one evening after the play, probably a little the worse for wine, the prickly but at bottom shy, inexperi- enced, and defenceless creature yielded to his practised technique of seduction and afterwards was prey to the illost scathing self- contempt
the frau consul began the conversation
he came to tea at five o'clock and said he had promised to be somewhere else between half past five and six, at the langewiesches' or rollwagens' - probably it was not true at all
for instance, the great-aunt and her charges sat once more at frau stöhr’s table, and marusja laughed as much as ever
dh, tony would furnish it to the queen's taste
i do not remember, said frau permaneder
it may well be, i like to think so, that elsewhere, in both elemy and allied countries, this short cut of fate was felt more as a catastrophe and gland nal- heur
but he was thinner and more active than his old friend, with bright little greenish eyes arid a long pointed nose
he was given over to the whims of the card-goblins, ensnared by the fitful and fickle favour of fortune, which sometimes let the face-cards and elevens pile up so that the game was over before the third tier was laid, when the fleeting triumph would stimulate the nerves to new efforts
the malay hastened to carry out his master’s will
we have told it to the end, and it was neither short nor long, but hermetic
the return to monteverdi and the style of his time is what i meant by the reconstruction of expressiveness, of ex- pressiveness in its first and original manifestation, expressiveness as lament '
herr k�n flung himself exhausted into one of them
that it was not
but tony possessed the gift of adaptability
her lips and even the tip of her nose were blue, probably from lack of air
the transition 'was made easy for him by his previous descrip- tions
but he promised it by this afternoon
the hofrat pretended to stagger backwards
indeed that absorbed and yearning look could only have been characterized as typically civilian
she winked and jerked her head in the direction of hans castorp, whose discomfiture she parodied with her mouth drawn down—no, illness and affliction had had no power to refine caroline stöhr; her jeers over the young man’s disappointment positively went beyond bounds
then he would look at his own hands, and their still clumsy movements, and see in them the hope foreshadowed of one day holding and using his knife and fork as grandfather did
morten lay turned toward her, his chin in his hands
a pure nature product--one knows just what one's eating
the spirit of the place, if i may put it so, is not conventional
she drew her hand back beneath her mantle, inclined her head, and turned away
the permanent accompanist of i\adame de strozzi-pecic will take over for the songs, and if only you, maitre, are simply present and show yourself to the public, nothing viii be lost, everything will be gained
but on the other hand, there were cases where this result was not obtained, could not and should not be obtained; and who, dr krokowski asked, would dare to say that these cases did not, psychically considered, form a higher, more exclusive type?
he had felt that the music was his enemy; but it had almost begun to look as if it had no such important bearing upon the situation
the connection offered you is a very good one, my dear tony
but i’m rather fond of you
she was always longing for heaven-- finished frau permaneder, and wiped her eyes
the more discordant a chord is, the more notes it contains contrasting and conflicting with each other, the more polyphonic it is, and the more markedly every single note bears the stamp of the part already in the simultaneous sound-combina- tion
silent, silent night, in four stanzas of three lines each, the last stanza of which dismayingly enough runs: but an honest joy does itself destroy for a harlot coy
but the whole lower part of his face, longish and narrow, was neither buddenbrook nor kroner, but from the mother's side of the house
for he is a quite extraordinary personality, which by itself is something for women, and then he is hardly a civilian, like me, he is a sort of military, a bit like my poor cousin, in that he has a point d’honneur, a sore spot, as it were, which is feeling, life—i know i am talking nonsense, but i’d rather go rambling on, and partly expressing something i find it difficult to express, than to keep on transmitting faultless platitudes
faith is the vehicle of knowledge, intellect secondary
meanwhile the baying of old suso or kaschperl, jumping about and rattling his chain in front of his kennel, seemed never to stop; he became quiet only when no more guests came and the conpany had gathered in the nike salon, whither the servants hastily fetchcd chairs from the family quarters and even froin the sleeping-chambers above
at table herr arnoldsen gave one of his witty and fanciful toasts in honour of the two bridal pairs
they call it bridge, he said, shaking his head, as they do outside, but it was really something else entirely

adrian phoned and asked the companion of his hungarian journey to come to him at pfeiffering

he wore a cinnamon-coloured coat with wide lapels and leg-of-mutton sleeves close-fitting at the wrists, and white linen trousers with black stripes up the outside seams
frau chauchat had made special toilet for carnival, she wore a new gown, or at least one new to our hero, of thin, dark silk, probably black, or at most shot with a golden brown
perhaps he wanted to play the son of the house, to whom the warerooms were commonplace everyday; perhaps the coolness native to him in general might thus express itself; for he maintained an almost shoulder-shrugging in- difference to all these splend<?urs, replying to my admiring ex- clamations with his short laugh and a yes, very nice or funny stuff or what all do not people trunl{ of!
the other figure stood in the protecting embrace of the first, with round, youthful face, and arms and hands wound and hidden in the folds of the mantle
but who is there to denounce him?
there, so to speak, one laid one’s head back in god, and closed one’s eyes
\y freising top-formers had hot heads and glowing eyes
one or two might be occupied temporarily
did you come late too?
he was a poet of distinction too, composing in his leisure tales in the most elegant tuscan prose—he was a master of the idioma gentile, settembrini said, rolling his native syllables with the utmost relish on his tongue and turning his head from side to side
that is no word for it, of course, mynheer peeperkorn, said hans castorp
her upbringing had been no more than highly correct: she had spent two years in an aristocratic girls' boarding-school il karlsruhe, patronized by the court
well, as far as that goes, i do not know about the hat--but you were certainly not much more cordial than she was, my love
what delightful, cosy times they had going to bed!
i believe i do not err in assuming our agreement in the conception of an original ideal state of man, a condition without government and without force, an unmediated condition as the child of god, in which there was neither lordship nor service, neither law nor penalty, nor sin nor relation after the flesh; no distinction of classes, no work, no property: nothing but equality, brotherhood, and moral perfectitude
but now he was startled to realize that christmas would be included in the programme—perhaps because (and yet not entirely because) he had never spent the christmas season anywhere but in the bosom of the family
they had gone down the corridor and outside the outer door, where they stood at the top of three little steps that went down to the pavement

summer before last a l\lu- nich painter and his wife had rented it; he vvanted to make land- scapes of the neighbourhood, the waldshut moors and so on, and had done some pretty views, though rather gloomy, being painted in a dun light

he would belong to the executive branch, perhaps, or the finance or building commission
here i have in inind what happened to her delicate and suffering sister inez, who cultivated the past and its regrets - and to poor rudi schwerdtfeger, of whon i thought with horror when i mentioned just now, almost involuntarily, the share of the recluse adrian leverktihn in these events
and his grandson, opposite, watched in silence, with deep, unconscious concentration, grandfather’s beautiful, thin, white old hands, with their pointed nails, and, on the right forefinger, the green seal ring with the crest; watched the small, deft, practised motions with which they arranged a mouthful of meat, vegetable, and potato on the end of his fork, and with a slight inclination of the head conveyed it to his mouth
so a light-year amounted to a round and net figure of six trillion miles, and the eccentricity of our solar system amounted to thirty thousand times as much, while the whole diameter of the galactic hollow ball came to two hundred thousand light-years
but a short time thereafter herr popoff, quite happy and serene, with his equally serene and happy wife, was to be seen sitting at the good russian table, finishing his meal as though nothing had happened
it will be issued in some twenty folio volumes, treating every species of human suffering, from the most personal and intimate to the great collective struggles arising from the conflicting interests of classes and nations; it will, in short, exhibit the chemical elements whose combination in various proportions results in all the ills to which our human flesh is heir
with rueful loyalty i had to reproduce a given thing; to transfer it from adrian's music-paper to my manuscript; and that i have done, not only word for word, but also, i nay' say, letter for letter - often laying down the pen to recover myself, to measure my study floor with heavy, pensive tread or to throw myself on my sofa with my hands clasped upon my brow
nonsense, tony--you and your life!
the management had done its share
listen, how would it be if we just dropped him out of our minds?
herr buddenbrook is down with erysipelas, and madame has a great deal to do, on account of the billeting
he wooed her, but in a sense for another
what am i to do?
only throwing in your hand
no, thomas, never will i consent to sit by while this goes on
tarily and with a what shall i do?
he confined himself to watching the gentlemen with his nose wrinkled up, in order to imitate them afterward at the club or in the family circle
and if you choose a will-o’-the-wisp to light
the husband was summoned, and informed that her stay up here would terminate only with her life
according to sister berta, she was about to die
he went on in this vein, and hans castorp listened without precisely following; first on account of his fatigue, and second because his attention was distracted by the proceedings of the lightheaded young folk on the steps
s- ing, aloof to the point of offensiveness, full of a chilling iclar
the upshot was that he kept his eye on settembrini, listened keenly and critically to what he had to say when they met on their prescribed walks to the bench on the mountain-side, or down to the platz, or wherever and whenever opportunity offered
soon after this was accomplished, in june of the same year, the young consul set out to amsterdam on a business journey the duration of which he did not know
and began the variations movement, the adagio molto semplice e cantabile
pastor pringsheim's sermon went on, turning the knife in the wound that death had made: he caused each person pres- his senses felt misty with the scent from countless bouquets and wreaths--and with another odour that came wafted now and then on a current of air, and smelled strange, yet somehow familiar
and now, shall we run through the provisions, my children?
everything gels done too slowly--so when it is finished the pleasure is already gone
a more remarkable thing, however, was that he took his sister tony aside again and again to hear in vivid detail the events buddenbrook of that fatal afternoon; for madame griinlkh had a gift of lively narration
he ate excellent meals in a spacious refectory where the rule of silence obtained—as in the corridors of the establishment—and in the centre of which a young prefect sat on a raised platform and read aloud
she was the only guest, for her daughter, who was to have gone, had visited her husband that afternoon in the prison, and felt, as she usually did, exhausted and incapable of further effort
a little time passed, some three or four weeks—this on our own reckoning, since on hans castorp’s we cannot depend
dh, heavens, how sublime that is!
it rained harder and harder; it was so dark that the first thing herr gr� did was to light the three candles on the table
-four years old; to speak of his appearance and ,vay of life as they then seemed to my al- ways anxious and observant eye
the real difference is in the look with which one pays homage to the one and to the other
but is there any one to whom you have been more gracious?
he did not look at anybody or change his expression
it blesses the object, the frightfully harried formulation, with overpowering humanity, lies in parting so gently on the hearer's heart in eternal farewell that the eyes run over
herr criinlich, in his long-skirted frock-coat and silk waistcoat, waited at the door
but on what pretext?
i cannot play that, my dear lady!
t the time we were there the experience which is the basis of the manuscript lay already in the past; that adrian at that time had already had the conversation which fol- lows, amounts with me to a certainty; so does it that he vvrote it down at once after the event, presumably the very next day
i recalled what he had written from halle to kretschmar about the extension of the kingdom of the banal
and then, at her request, he gave an exposition of the existing legal grounds for divorce, and an even longer dis-course after it, which had for its subject-matter the law touching dowry rights
it became a loud, desperate protest against something which he saw or which was happening to him
a minute, then, is as long as it seems to you when you measure yourself?
and now his body has come into the foreground in another sense and made itself important and independent of the rest of him—namely, through illness
i must close this letter, dear mother; considering that in a few days, we shall be talking over my good fortune together, it is already too long
what it lacked in quantity it made up for in—
ah, krokowski, settembrini cried
herr settembrini, in fact, found him packing his trunk
you can look out for yourself!
no formalities with a simple man like me
how splen-did you look!
when i say streps, behrens began again, you must not picture a well-known or severe type of illness
a trait at least worthy of praise
oh, he is-- frau permaneder seemed not able to get away from this dreadful phrase
i have heard you call hofrat behrens that before, herr settembrini
thus in the inmost recesses of nature, as in an endless succession of mirrors, was reflected the macrocosm of the heavens, whose clusters, throngs, groups, and figures, paled by the brilliant moon, hung over the dazzling, frost-bound valley, above the head of our muffled adept
he was driven by his own inability to be quiet--which his fellow-burghers would have been right in ascribing to his vanity--for it was another manifestation of the same thing
but i think we are far from being well enough as we are
it might have taught me how proud i was of his general indifference, and how clearly i felt that in his it is curious, indifference became a mask

fräulein engelhart rejected the idea with scorn

after half an hour, during which nothing was heard but the scratching of pens and the sound of herr marcus discreetly clearing his throat, the consul looked over the green half-blind and saw christian coming down the street
i don’t know, really, herr settembrini
when he came home for the holidays, very clean, very well dressed, with a little red-blond moustache that became his sleepy, young patrician face, obviously en route to a considerable position in life, people looked at him, the people who concerned themselves with the affairs of the community and made it their business to know all about family and social relations—and that, in a self-governing city-state, meant most of the population—they looked him well over, his fellow citizens, and asked themselves what public rôle young castorp was destined to fill
my dear friend—irreproachable, very
hermetics—what a lovely word, herr naphta!
they all sat spellbound, and when quiet was restored outside, zur bohe raised his voice again in his dogmatic beautiful!
he said no more
half past is early enough, child
in- deed, my mind misgives me that  shall only be awakening the reader's doubt whether he is in the right hands: whether, i mean, my whole existence does not disqualify me for a task dictated by my heart rather than by any true competence for the work
should i admire your mockery?
that’s good too, laughed hans castorp
dr krokowski strode over to the wall and switched on the ceiling lamp; the light flashed up glaringly, making them all blink
hush, wehsal, hush, the coachman can understand you
then, in a voice appropriately subdued, he began a conversation with the widow, eliciting information about the sufferings, the last days and moments of her departed husband, and the arrangements for transporting the body to carinthia; displaying a sympathy and conversance that was in part physicianly, in part priestly and moralizing
but he was not very popular
frau antonie criinlich stood proudly in the doorway, behind her the two servant-maids, with white caps, bare arms, and thick striped skirts--she had engaged them beforehand for her sister-in-law
it was prob- ably an unjust reproach, for he had not necessarily got in at the same time with inez
it had with death certain relations, which one might love, yet not without consciously, and in a stocktaking sense, acknowledging a certain illicit element in one’s love
the projecting fronts of some of the houses jutted out into the roadway; others had porticos or raised benches added on
a per- fectly absurd wish; it is much more soothing to know that after death one will be the foam on the sea, as nature wills
he may even have muttered some abusive epithet between his teeth, some outraged cry of protest
his active years had fallen in a decade of rapid growth and repeated upheavals, a decade of progress by forced marches, which had made continual demands on the public capacity for enterprise and self-sacrifice
but your bl dei is after all- or not after all, i beg pardon, i mean before all - a part of this abominable nature - ,vith a not very generous quan- tum of potential spirituality
hans castorp lent an ear to the learned strife between ovists and animalculists: the first of whom asserted that the egg was in itself the complete little frog, dog, or human being, the male element being only the incitement to its growth; while the second saw in a spermatozoon, possessing head, arms, and legs, the perfected form of life shadowed forth, to which the egg performed only the office of nourisher in life’s feast
they walked in this hushed, whispering peacefulness by the sea, whose every faint murmur, near or far, seemed to have a deep significance

he was uttering all sorts of nonsense
and there was also more than one of its opposite number among the wood-wind instruments, the contra-bassoon, sixteen- foot likewise - in other words, sounding an octave lower than the notes indicate - mightily strengthening the basses, built in twice the dimensions of its smaller brother the humorous bassoon, to which i give that name because it is a bass instrument without proper bass strength, oddly weak in sound, bleating, burlesque
snl of kaisersaschern, and an out-and-out cosmopolitanism
o lord, lead us and guide us all, so long as we live upon this earth the pen hurried glibly over the paper, with here and there a commercial flourish, talking with god in every line
both of them, behrens no less than joachim, looked at him amazed—was he not ashamed of this confused, impromptu harangue?
there were four glass doors, two on the opposite wall, opening on the verandah, a third at the bottom of the room on the left, leading into the front hall, and a fourth, by which hans castorp had entered through a vestibule, as joachim had brought him down a different stair from the one they had used yesterday evening

an enormous brick-red boiled ham appeared, strewn with crumbs and served with a sour brown onion sauce, and so many vegetables that the company could have satisfied their appetites from that one vegetable-dish
but she rapidly adjusted herself--the more readily that her thoughts and efforts were soon taken up by plans for the future
but i protest against them with my whole sense of justice as a christian and a business man
the place is shamefully jerry-built, of course
at a quarter after twelve, when the musical program was drawing to a close, an incident occurred which in no wise interfered with the prevailing good feeling, but which obliged the master of the house to leave his guests for a short time
did you do it?
nothing went well any more, nothing turned out as he intended it should
she lacked, he said, the first requisite of all dramatic art, the instinct of the play-actor - what one calls theatre blood; and in all conscience he felt constrained to
yes, we sit here and laugh, he said, with a long face, his words interrupted by the heaving of his diaphragm, we sit here and laugh, but there’s no telling when i shall get away
ful and consummate work of tonal art
we make bold to say that here was a democracy of tables, all honourable alike
we can hardly get along as it is
he had an odd name for the serious mental preoccupations which absorbed him in his picturesque retreat; he called them taking stock; the expression, crude as it was, defined for him an employment which he loved, even though it was bound up in his mind with the phenomena of fear and giddiness and palpitation, and made his face burn even more than its wont
such was the immediate view—wearisome to move in, quaintly, roguishly stimulating to the fancy
it was, to be sure, four-and-twenty hours—but equally it was the simple sum of nothings
lauro proved to be an astonishingly handsome young man, with great glowing eyes, a nose like an eagle’s beak, quivering nostrils, and beautiful lips, with a small black moustache sprouting above them
d in which you assert we stand has itself to do with love, you doating fool

evening parties, blissfully absorbed in flirtation with the other sex, young girls as well as more mature women
but then, what he had said, quite unblushingly and without embarrassment, to his wife, was this: tonerl--he called her tonerl--tonerl, that's good enough for me
he: you are a sly dog!
kai knew he would have felt the same in hanno's place
he, not settembrini, was in reality the free-thinker, the man who looked for guidance within himself
you won’t be able to hear yourselves think—mark my words
he would say, just as when he went to bed
this he called a compronise for home use, as also the tempered piano was a thing precisely for domestic con- sumption, a transient peace-pact, not a hundred and fifty years old, which had brought to pass all sorts of considerable things, oh, very considerable, but about which we should not imagine that everything was settled for eternity
when hans castorp stirred again, the mountains would be wholly lost in a cloud of snow; only a pinnacle, a jutting rock, might show one instant, to be rapt away the next
that is sentimental, as you say
but it was impossible; the hofrat said poor little gerngross could not stand the journey
they might have said: unhappily it looks as though things would follow this and this course
if a man does not serve the best and dearest wines at his dinners, people don’t go, and his daughters are left on his hands

in the case of the younger, cla- rissa, the uprooting out of her hereditary middle class had been conscious, deliberate, and pronounced

you and your native land, you preserve a silence which seems to cover a reservation—and which gives one no hint of what goes on in your depths

then hanno stayed in the salon of thr kuihuusk and played on the little piano that was used to play waltzes and schotlisches for the balls and was not so good for improvising on as the piano at home: still one could some- times get amusing effects out of its muffled and clacking keys
it was a simple, acceptable, and physiologically necessary phenomenon; to dwell upon it longer than decency required was to rob life of its due
they looked at elly, suddenly struck by her silence
all the cares of the new household fell upon her, but she reaped her reward in pride and pleasure
the rest would be decided later
then he turned the conversation to indifferent topics and asked herr cosch about business and his health
among the crowd were settled, grey-bearded, highly respectable citizens, wearing the most irreproachable national-liberal expression on their faces, and tapping their sticks along the pavement
he parried them by thanking her for having come so quickly, saying it was splendid to have her, and how delighted joachim would be
dr dverdieck, the burgomaster, was saying so just now
rudolf had not even taken off his short fur jacket, and adrian had put on his camel's-hair ulster
but it's you we are talking about, tom!
she had been a patient up here, joachim would know—
nonsense!—it was the best time of all
adrian kept the picture in his rnind; but for a long time it did not determine his decisions
that is all nonsense, of course, he said in a dispassionate tone
and since on account of the increasing ravages of corruption an example was bitterly needed, the two witches, the old one and the young, were burned at the stake, one beside the other on the open square

he said that being virtuous and healthy did not, in fact, constitute being in a state of religion at all
he had never, like his sister tony, flung himself across the table sobbing like a child; and he shrank from hearing the heart-broken words in which madame gr�, from roast to dessert, loved to celebrate the character and person of her dead father
he liked the darkness, it mitigated the queerness of the situation
those were his words, though of course it sounded much more plastic and literary as he said it
a man who stands firm and confident in his own calling, whatever it may be, recog-nizes only it, understands only it, values only it
it seemed to him that anger was no longer in place; he even had an obscure feeling that he was partly responsible, that he shared the blame with her before the others
but joachim answered that nobody knew whether the hofrat was still a patient—he was probably long since cured
on the otlut hand, he was doing the hard-pressed land-owner a fivour which he was called upon to do, by reason of tony's con-nection with the maibooms
of the st matthew passion
then he began to employ himself silently with the class register, holding his pen in a way that was incomparably correct, with the slender fingers out-stretched; while about him people yawned, laughed, conned their lessons, and chattered half aloud
i am in my third year up here—i’m sick of it, fed up, i can’t play the game any more—do you blame me for that?
i stood at his father's side in the ', when, with a word, he tamed the unleashed fury of the mob
and tinally fate overtook her and put to shame her contemptuous \\tay of looking down her nose
johann buddenbrook thanked them all for their kindness, first as head of the family and then as senior partner of the firm--and sent thomas for another bottle of malmsey
thoughts that had to do with madame chauchat’s recklessness and abandon, her ailing state, the heightening and accentuation of her physical parts by disease, the corporealization, so to speak, of all her being as an effect of disease—an effect in which he, hans castorp, by the physician’s verdict, was now to share
if i get only one more bad mark, i sha not go up, said johann; and i am sure to get it when i am called up for latin
he cleared his throat by way of testing his voice; then he coughed
i felt, of course, vexed and in
and how it would hurt me!
settembrini said his joviality is forced, and one must admit that settembrini has his own views and knows whereof he speaks
joachim said more than once in these days, let us hope it has done you good to be up here, and that you will feel the benefit when you are at home again
i had to sell no very small quantity of grain not very advantageously--or, rather, i had to sell a large quantity very much at a loss
an educational system which still conceives itself as a child of the age of enlightenment, with criticism as its chosen medium of instruction, the liberation and cult of the ego the solvent of forms of life which are absolutely fixed—such a system may still, for a time, reap an empty rhetorical advantage; but its reactionary character is, to the initiated, clear beyond any doubt all educational organizations worthy of the name have always recognized what must be the ultimate and significant principle of pedagogy: namely the absolute mandate, the iron bond, discipline, sacrifice, the renunciation of the ego, the curbing of the personality
it happened when he was a lad of thirteen, in knee-breeches, in the lower third form at school
there is a but in your tone, herr settembrini
that expression he wore, as of something bad-tasting in the mouth, had grown more and more pronounced
maria, he felt, made a sort of bond between him, the exile, and his home in the flat-land—a bond more effectual than the postcards he now and then sent to his uncle, the intervals between which grew longer in proportion as he imbibed the more spacious time conceptions prevalent up here
even anton had left the house, and gone over to the; young pair, where he was more needed
now i must tell you a little story
what difficulties would he not have, to acclimatize himself?
but that he does fight, rejoined naphta, remains the distinctive feature of his existence as a soldier
we shall take you at your word
she received him alone, in the middle corridor room on the first floor, where a fire was laid, and she had arranged a heavy table with ink and writing materials and a quantity of foolscap paper from the of-fice
hermine kleefeld leaned against herr albin’s shoulder as she held her glass to be filled
there is such a lack of modesty in so much communicativeness
anyhow that is a very nice point - in more than one sense of the ,vord
two children, a son and a daughter, had been born; then they had brought her up here, the fragile body already fever-smitten; a few months had seen the completion of the wasting-away process
she asserted that some of them had tears running down into their beards
you usually take your jokes more seriously than your seriousness
frau stöhr whimpered that she would like to stop, but they told her she should have thought of that before, she must just keep quiet now
his head-piece sustained without undue strain the demands made upon it by the course at the realgymnasium—strain, indeed, was something to which he was quite definitely disinclined, whatever the circumstances or the object of his effort; less out of fear of hurting himself than because he positively saw no reason, or, more precisely, saw no positive reason, for exertion
at that rime, unlike adrian, who when he had spent the evening in munich used to stick to his eleven-o'clock train back to pfeiffering, i had rented a room in schwabing, hohenzollernstrasse, not far behind the siegesthor, in order to be independent and on occasion to have a roof over my head in the city
as she did not own a single sou, she knew that she would find nobody in all the wide world to marry her, and she looked with humility into her future, which would surely consist of consuming a tiny in-come in some tiny room which her influential uncle would procure for her out of the funds of some charitable establishment for maidens of good family
say what you like—and there was a lot to be said for the idea that illness had something solemn and ennobling about it—yet after all, you couldn’t deny that illness was an accentuation of the physical, it did throw man back, so to speak, upon the flesh and to that extent was detrimental to human dignity
the nerves controlling the blood-vessels that supplied his face functioned so well that the skin, robbed of all its blood, went quite cold, the nose looked peaked, and the hollows beneath the young eyes were lead-coloured as any corpse’s
will you permit me to ask how old you are?
your most obedient servant, as they say in halle
you can shut your fist, you see
i am not so anxious to undertake anything for the moment
he was gnawed by chagrin at the insult that had been offered him, and he stared, weary and chilled, at the cushions opposite
he longed to flee—as we have seen already
not yet, hans castorp answered
he was questioned, not ignored, as had so long been the case, to his slight and concealed but daily recurring annoyance
and the cosmopolitanism of the institution prevented his race from being perceptible
it could only add to its authority and its awfulness
quite suddenly he found himself in the far distant past, transported to a scene which had come back to him in a dream some nights before, summoned by certain impressions of the last few days
pieter peeperkorn lay in one of the two; its red satin coverlet was strewn with papers, books, and letters, and he was reading the telegraaf through his horn-rimmed pince-nez with the high nose-piece
and as she looked at him—with her narrow, blue-grey eyes above the broad cheek-bones—he tore himself by violence away from his dream, for now he had it fast and meant to hold it, of what and whom she so vividly reminded him
peeperkorn raged at the precipitate breaking-up of the festivities, in kingly choler struck the table with his fist and called after the retreating cowardly slaves—but allowed frau chauchat and hans castorp to calm him with the consideration that the banquet had already lasted some six hours, and must in any case some time come to an end
well, if you like to call it that--but what i call it is a disgrace, a slap in the face; because that is just what it would be
his age would have been hard to say, probably between thirty and forty; for though he gave an impression of youthfulness, yet the hair on his temples was sprinkled with silver and gone quite thin on his head
with pleasure, he said
he was not ambitious for expert skill, and all he needed he acquired in a few days, without undue strain on wind or muscles
as i said, i have a number of affairs on hand
well, he declared, i am certainly far from feeling fit up here
he felt put out; his voice vibrated with ill humour as he answered to his cousin’s knock on the wall; and he appeared to joachim on his entrance like anything but a man refreshed and invigorated by a good night’s sleep
if winter consists in darkness and cold, snow and hot pipes, then there’s no denying it’s winter again
no, i left long ago
but to measure one’s own private time, that time which for the individual in these parts was so closely bound up with space—that was held to be an occupation only fit for new arrivals and short-termers
today it can be done, but it is only just playable, and in his time it was simply not
you have made a position for yourself in life; and there you stand, and push everything away which might possibly disturb your equi-librium for a moment--for your equilibrium is the most precious thing in the world to you
she was a failure or at least lacking any genuine success, for the simple reason, so hard for the person con- cerned to grasp, that her natural talent was not equal to her am- bition
for she had wished to marry, she had so longed to marry and live, and she had done it: healed and sound she had wedded her dear husband, himself as sound as a berry, who on his side had no notion at all of such things
it said: com-mit your ways unto the lord
we should all nf us be just the same
and end is come, the end is come, it watcheth for thee, be- hold, it is come
sometimes the hofrat would appear, and perform his stunt with the bootlaces
if you only feel that i spoke in good part--you do, do not you?
but now, here he was--he stood before her
everything is so queer
it was not his fault; he had held far more with ancestral ways and old institutions than with ruinous schemes for widening the harbour, or godless and rubbishing plans for a great metropolis
settembrini made difficulties—there were difficulties, he said
he was only looking with fixed gaze back into his own past life and at life in gen-eral
you answered with such assurance—
she sat down in a chair and stopped there without moving
i love the angelic in his figure, which reminds me of shelley: the peculiarly and very inysteriously veiled, unapproachable, withdrawing, un- adventurous flavour of his being, that not ,vanting to know, that rejection of material experience, the sublime incest of his fantas- tically delicate and seductive art
have they whipped him yet?
totally anæmic, as i was saying
he felt his heart give a sudden beat—without rhyme or reason, of its own accord, as it had taken to doing up here
moreover, there were preparations to be made for his reception
oh, nothing very good, tom
he spent his time in preparations; settled his last account with the management, and days ahead of time began to pack
i remember it like yesterday
it reminded him of the colour of certain eyes, whose shape and glance had spelled his destiny; eyes to which herr settembrini, from his humanistic height, had referred with contempt as tartar slits and wolf’s eyes—eyes seen long ago and then found again, the eyes of pribislav hippe and clavdia chauchat
and his aversion from it, a matter of taste, an aesthetic revulsion, a reaction of human pride— if we may use such large words in connexion with our modest hero—was almost as great as his curiosity
do you see it, young man?
ida jungmann sat, white-haired, bright-eyed, and angular, opposite hanno on the back seat, and he squeezed his head into the corner and looked past her out of the window
or two months nepomul{ had been the joy of the house
before i forget it, he said abruptly, you may introduce me to the lady in the garden if you like, i mean if it happens that way, i have no objection
now, if the life about him, if his own time seem, however outwardly stimulating, to be at bottom empty of such food for his aspirations; if he privately recognize it to be hopeless, viewless, helpless, opposing only a hollow silence to all the questions man puts, consciously or unconsciously, yet somehow, puts, as to the final, absolute, and abstract meaning in all his efforts and activities; then, in such a case, a certain laming of the personality is bound to occur, the more inevitably the more upright the character in question; a sort of palsy, as it were, which may even extend from his spiritual and moral over into his physical and organic part
he would soon eat again, this young mar,
they are expecting me in amsterdam
they are throwing stones--i have had enough of that
then, interrupting himself loudly, as if tony should hear only this part, he added, i beg you, hold that position!
the harvest, the entire harvest of pöppenrade?
oh, please, buddenbrook, grätjens began, bending over the table and taking careful aim, waving the cue back and forth in his bony hand, a customs union—i don’t understand
all the krögers have been partial to luxury
they have so many interests in common, sometimes even relatives
because the molecule was made up of atoms, and the atom was not even close to being large enough to be called extraordinarily small
that helped—it was chivalrous and humane of herr settembrini
dr langhals had gone home for a while, but when he returned he found everything as before
all this, however, did not prevent hans castorp from gaining two distinct impressions from his arrival
that will be sad, but since the sphere of my work is of the freest, most purely intellectual sort, it will not prevent me from serving the cause of humankind, from defying the spirit of disease to my last dying breath
and then, in a low voice, he implored herr buddenbrook to sit still and open his mouth wide—and went to work
i do not despise you
you were very cocky with your answers that day
pausing in the smoking room for a cigarette after second breakfast, he had found it tucked in a corner of the bookshelf, behind a row of sturdy tomes, and recalled that he had bought it casually on sale at a bookshop years ago—a rather thick volume, poorly bound and badly printed on thin, yellowed paper, just the second half of a famous metaphysical system
it’s not dangerous, as far as i know, but a stubborn case and it keeps recurring
what we lack is precisely that, the naivete, and that deficiency, if one may call it that, protects us from many a colorful barbarism that would be quite compatible with culture, with very high culture indeed
after such exaltation, his sudden reward was radical gloom, a hangover that bordered on despair
the church, in which that view has survived, has chosen to do battle, in a humanistic spirit, with astronomical knowledge, has declared it the devil's work, has forbidden it in honor of man, has insisted on ignorance out of humaneness
someone was supposed to say, go!—except no one had recalled that it was the neutral party’s task to issue this dreadful invitation, or at least no one had mentioned it
and just then a fly settled on the inert forehead and began to move its proboscis up and down
from then on joachim assumed a permanent horizontal position, and hans castorp wrote to luise ziemssen about it—wrote to her from his splendid lounge chair that he must now add to his earlier occasional reports the news that joachim was bedfast and that although his cousin had said nothing, one could see in his eyes that it was his wish to have his mother beside him, and that director behrens had expressly seconded this unspoken wish
he strove to give the impression of being a wild, handsome, scheming devil, to play the role of a wicked, crafty, interesting villain, somewhere between mephistopheles and napoleon—and he pulled it off rather well
any other feelings i may have must be left unstated
the horrors that have just been heard are now transported, with fully different instrumentation and restructured rhythms, into a totally different register by this indescribable children's chorus
with obvious relish, indeed with open praise, he dined on layer cake, each narrow, curving slice of which was richly veined with chocolate
no, things can’t go on like this
it was impossible, he said, to concern oneself with something done, when one was now in a state of being incapable of doing anything better; the past was only bearable if one felt superior to it, instead of having to stare stupidly at it in the awareness of one's pres�nt impotence
but that was not all; what distressed him was no longer simply the worry about his son’s or his firm’s future
war, settembrini exclaimed, even war, my dear sir, has on occasion been forced to serve progress—as you yourself must grant me, if you will recall certain events from your own favorite epoch, by which i mean the crusades
hans castorp cried, and now hilarity got the better of him
then he got up again
as far as i know, you’re in agreement with mama’s wish, aren’t you?
so you would have agreed had i left it at that?
i’m telling you—be careful
on the way to the opera, it was
on the coming sunday he would be present for another of the regular fortnightly band concerts, and on monday he would likewise attend another of dr krokowski’s fortnightly lectures—or so he said to himself and to joachim
she’d never think of it
it turned out that on that very same morning, in new jersey, her sister sophie had died of inflammation of the heart
and he spoke of joachim’s general disgust and plans to depart—and made sure to add that one would doubtless be doing the engineer a disservice if one did not ascribe to him the same impatience to return to his work
followed by other guests emerging from the social rooms, two curious figures now made their entrance—they had apparently only just finished with their costumes
ah, as secretly as it came, the silent magic died
hanno let go of his knee, which he had been holding fast until now
the body doesn’t give a damn about the meaning of the stimulus
dressed in his danish sailor outfit, with white trim at the neck and a thick knotted sailor’s tie fluffed at the wide linen collar, he leaned against the piano, crossing his thin legs, his head and upper body turned slightly to one side in a pose that was both shy and full of an unconscious grace
by which we do not mean to cast any aspersions whatever against the so-called bad russian table
he fell silent, and tony was silent, too
someone pulled the window curtains back and blew out the candles
but so much the better, then, if academic life keeps one young, which means: preserves a loyalty to the mind, to free thought, to higher interpretation of the crude event
i can wait no longer
but do you still love me at all?
he pulled out the pony, looked at it as if he had some putrid piece of garbage in his hand, slipped it into his pocket, and disdainfully tossed petersen’s ovid back on his desk
and then he put a stop to those great forces
and sister leandra came
was this artificial return mere playacting?
hermine kleefeld was part of the group, as was herr albin, who passed around a large flowered box of chocolates from which all the others ate, whereas he did not touch them, but instead assumed a paternal air and smoked gold-tipped cigarettes
he sat down beside hanno buddenbrook, smiled softly—and a little slyly—and said good morning to his neighbor, adopting the current slang by contracting the greeting to a sassy, casual monosyllable
it had all contributed to making his existence what it was: artificial, self-conscious, and forced—until every word, every gesture, the slightest deed in the presence of others had become a taxing and grueling part in a play
yes, thank god, that did us some good
c'est l'heure exquise ; another is the equally magical chanson d'automne ; a third, fantastically melancholy and maddeningly melodic, has three stanzas that open with: un grand sommeil noir-tombe sur ma vie
but first, what is your name?
i presume that’s what you had in mind in asking
from the slope on his right, a mountain stream swept along a flat, stony bed, then rushed foaming over terraced boulders in its path, and finally flowed more serenely toward the valley, crossed at that point by a picturesque wooden bridge with simple railings
i am confident that, by dint of your own hard work, you have proved yourself worthy of the accommodating spirit he has shown and that you will continue to do so
and with that, this part of hans castorp’s life came to an end as well, and a very short time later he changed homes and neighborhoods—for the second time now in his young life
for whereas lodovico, as he himself reported with bitterness, found himself restricted to deriding life and manners at the international sanatorium berghof, to offering his sardonic criticism and protesting in the name of beautiful, vigorous humanity, his grandfather had given governments trouble, had conspired against austria and the holy alliance, which in those days held his dismembered fatherland in the grip of darkest bondage, and had been a zealous member of certain secret societies that had spread throughout italy—a carbonaro, as settembrini suddenly declared, lowering his voice, as if it were still dangerous even now to speak the word
king solomon in all his glory
our only explanation is that there was something shrewdly life-affirming in our hero’s nature, which allowed him to find everything worth listening to and which one might also call obligingness, in the sense that it not only bound him to very different kinds of people and personalities, but also to some extent linked them to one another
in d that the
that history had in fact been one of the progressive application of human reason, by which, on the basis of purely rational concerns, god had gradually been removed from the administration of justice
jump; and in fact he was forever trying to win adrian's favor in the most naive fashion, undauntable in his confiding familiarity
please excuse me, i am very busy
he took the liberty of remaining seated, because that created a handsomer effect, and, with the addition of just a few chivalrous gestures of hands and head, he toasted the two ladies of the house, madame antoinette and the consul’s wife
have you heard the latest, bethsy?
and when i first took communion at my confirmation, it came in waves—the tingling and prickling just wouldn’t stop
and while joachim gasped behind his napkin and frau magnus, his neighbor, pounded on his back in the time-honored fashion, the cousins’ eyes met in a way that frightened hans castorp even more than the incident itself, which of course could happen to anyone; and then joachim lowered his eyes, hid his face in his napkin, and left the table and the dining hall to cough himself out elsewhere
and dr langhals turned his beautiful eyes away, inspected his fingernails, and remarked how impossible it was for a frail human to answer the question whether frau permaneder’s brother would survive the night or be called to his reward within the next few minutes
most dissonances, he says, have more likely come into harmony by way of melody than through any harmonic combination
the lentil-sized red spots on the chest and stomach have multiplied
the midwife was questioned as well, but she stubbornly denied it
he deserts to the colors, hans castorp said dreamily
it was almost impossible to engage joachim’s interest in these matters, since he thought of nothing—as hans castorp had himself noted one evening in french—except being a soldier down in the plains, and lived in increasingly bitter conflict with his hopes, which teased him by now drawing nearer, now vanishing into the distance
there was a constant coming and going
i don’t really know how to put it
a gift more rare than precious stone
christian was in much the same state as poor klothilde
but was it not, perhaps, all for the good?
hell’s bells, ’m lookin’ for ’ard to that, herr permaneder shouted, turning his whole easy chair around to face the door
keep still and just let your head hang low if it’s so heavy
you can tell even when he’s a young man that there’s something to him
i find it peculiar, he said gloomily, pointing with his wrinkled-up nose at his bony, badly bowed leg and scrawny knee, which made a woebegone knob in his white underwear
his truncated musical coffin, inside which the song decayed into some electrical gramophone music
although since it is always the same day, it is surely not correct to speak of repetition
explicitly remarked that this critique must necessarily turn against traditional forms and genres of art-for instance, against the aesthetic kind of theater that had been part of the bourgeois circle of life, an occasion for its refinement?
she pulled her blanket up and gazed dreamily at the ceiling
i had barely put my pen to paper when a word flowed from it that is already the source of some personal discomfiture: the word genius,
shortly thereafter the newlyweds drove off with old thomas to the station in weissenfels, there to board a train for their trip to dresden, while the wedding guests spent several hours together over frau luder's fine fruit liqueurs
and not the elm, whose branches stirred beneath his window and to whose wonderful fragrance when it bloomed, in the same season as his own birth, he seemed to show some response
and if she should, it would somehow be as horrifying as if she had crawled out of her coffin
and roar he did, declaring everything naphta had said to be chicanery, humbug, confusion
well, they’re married, for heaven’s sake, that’s as it should be at least
only love, and not reason, yields kind thoughts
i value the courtesy of your modest phrases
you are coming along, are not you ?
also a divorced romanian authoress from transylvania, who had written several comedies and maintained a bohemian salon in schwabing; plus rosa zwitscher, an actress from the hoftheater, whose performances often had a grand nervous intensity-and one or two other female figures who need not be characterized, particularly since i am not certain in every case of their active membership in the club
no one could fail to notice his emotion-including the child
that regales, he said
heavens, how right you are
there was a chamber music series: quartets and trios; instrumental solos for violin, cello, and flute; concert pieces with violin or flute obligato; solo piano works
that is how we humans are
had it dedicated to you ?
atop the well—she went on reading—which i can see from my window, is a madonna, and sometimes they crown her with wreaths, and then the common people kneel down with their rosaries and pray, which really looks quite pretty, but it is written: enter into thy closet
and each time rascal luck tickled their nerves, there would be a moment of exaltation or despair, an eruption of anger or a hysterical fit of laughter, and all their outbursts were in genuine earnest and would have sounded no different had these been the ups and downs in life’s fortunes
that was not their way
one day a package arrived from hamburg, where she had ordered several things, and it contained a dressing gown—trimmed, this time, not with velvet, of course, but with little cotton bows
is it the case that our intentions are at cross purposes, that you wanted to ask her to be your wife?
they would certainly not have it so good
but after dr grabow’s brief but serious conversation with the consul on the stairs, after consultation with a second doctor—a newcomer to town, a stout man with a black beard and a gloomy expression—who now began to arrive and leave with grabow, the physiognomy of the household changed, so to speak
that way, i thought, only the stars would be left
he treated adrian, on whom he had cast a vaguely expectant eye, very much like his own son and enjoyed having a family member round out his table, which had so long consisted of only the aforementioned frau butze and, by a patriarchal gesture, his apprentice luca
there was something absolutely repulsive about the boy, but herr ballerstedt praised him for his efforts
and with that, she began dripping honey on her slice of country bread
yes, that’s the popular understanding
there was a splendid party on the eve of the wedding, to which half the town was invited
and whistled—no, that was just too crazy!
assez, christian, madame buddenbrook said
ah, that’s tous-les-deux, he said
it was a brawl, an unseemly and indecent wrestling match, between babette the cook and herr permaneder
i do understand that you don’t always want to turn your head to watch
tony, her mouth full of bread and butter, looked at her father, then at her mother, with a mixture of curiosity and alarm
into that volume had been inserted a note, written in an unknown hand, with the dictum:
if someone wants something from you, she seemed to want to say, you jump
i most certainly do not have a pony
leverkiihn attended these shows and, as i noticed, also studied literature on the very ingenious hand puppets and shadow plays of the javanese
the director, his neck arched, was just rowing off toward home; hans castorp broke into a trot, even took the freedom of shouting—but got no response
there she stood, victorious in the good fight that she had waged all her life against the onslaughts of reason
and when these good things arrived, he greeted them with gusto, rubbing his hands and attempting to share his emotions in a few words that broke off impressively, but nevertheless proved quite effective, at least as a general display of personality
making use of exhaustive and graphic detail in an effort to be understood, he was able to describe, however, a horrible anomaly which he had noticed of late, the nature of which was that on certain days—depending on the weather and his mood—he could not look at an open window without being overcome, for no reason whatever, by the urge to leap out of it—a savage instinct, a kind of mad and desperate foolhardiness that he found almost impossible to suppress
how does one burst the cocoon and become a butterfly?
not long before, about a week after new year—and it must be kept in mind that while we tell our story, the silent, restless current of time sweeps on—news spread at breakfast that the bath attendant had found them that morning lying on their beds still in wrinkled evening clothes
and yet, at moments when no one had so much as mentioned his dead father, tears would slowly fill his eyes—with no change at all in his facial expression
god took her, and the buddenbrooks received a lot of money, a nice round sum of one hundred thousand thalers courant, which increased the firm’s working capital in a most timely fashion
heaven knows, the mattress is just seaweed—we’re simple folk
yes, there’s no mistaking that whiff of spookiness
the imitation was convincing, full of passion and subterfuge, irresistibly comic, with a touch of the eccentric burlesque that the english and americans do so well—yet never for a moment unpleasant, because christian was enjoying himself much too much
as always, patients had gathered to watch the departure: frau iltis of the stirletto, fräulein levi of the ivory complexion, drastic herr popóv and his wife
edgar—that was lüders, fat lüders, there, by the window, the letter l, and it wasn’t even close to being his turn
i mean the world is normally arranged so that it meets people’s needs and is salutary to their love of life, there’s no denying that
generally speaking, the females seemed less endangered in this regard
what he had wanted from
a swallow fluttered so low over the street that its wings seemed to brush the cobblestones
i discovered that he was increasingly preoccupied with an interest in music wedded to word, with its vocal articulation; he was engaged now almost exclusively in composing lieder, shorter and longer songs, even fragments of epics, taking his material from a collection of mediterranean verse in a rather felicitous german translation, which included proven�al and catalonian lyrics from the twelfth and thirteen centuries, italian poetry, visionary highlights from the divina commedia, as well as some spanish and portuguese works
the most contemptuous word from his mouth was progress; he had a scathing way of saying it, and one indeed sensed that he understood the conservative scorn he devoted to progress to be his true passport into this society, the badge of his presentability
the ground was rather slippery and he would have to move with a good deal of grace—which made it that much more suited to him
and when i say, not indifferent, that's not the right way of putting it exactly
she no longer slept—at first because of pain, coughing fits, and shortness of breath, but later because she resisted sleep and fought to stay awake
he had bought it; indeed, he had apparently set his heart on it, because he had immediately outbid an offer that siegismund gosch had received from a party in bremen
at seven o’clock he died—alfreda schildknecht was out in the hall, only his mother and cousin were present
herr settembrini pressed his lips together, and so hans castorp hurried to add that he himself, of course, would refrain from taking sides or endorsing any viewpoint, but he had found it worth listening to what naphta said about the desires of youth
and automatically one set to work to join him in this attitude
the older children attended the local grammar school; although the intellectual offerings of this institution were sufficient for leo’s brothers and sisters, that was anything but the case for him, the oldest
and the moment something begins to subside, to relax, to grow weary, then everything around us is turned loose, resists us, rebels, moves beyond our influence
admittedly, however, kotzebue had been in the employ of the russians, that is, of the holy alliance; and so sand was presumably striking a blow for freedom—but that, too, turned improbable when one considered the fact that he counted jesuits among his closest friends
but once joachim had returned home alone and spread the news among their relatives of how things stood up here, an attack was due, indeed overdue; and so hans castorp had not been the least bit surprised when, barely two weeks after joachim’s departure, the concierge handed him a telegram, whose content he surmised even as he opened it: an announcement of the imminent arrival of james tienappel
laying both hands on the portrait to lift it off its hook, he began hastily by saying, yes indeed, yes indeed
you are part of it the moment you wish to be
european pharmacology had known of it, by the way, for less than three hundred years, and chemistry had discovered quinine less than a hundred years before—that is, the alkaloid that was the basis of its virtue—discovered and to some extent analyzed it, though thus far the chemists could not claim to understand its composition well enough to produce it artificially
you look like you’ve struck root
hans castorp thought, listening intently
behrens was a brick of a fellow and would come up with a cure
he fell silent, sorry that he hadn’t added a final and before letting his voice fall, since he didn’t know what else to say now
i need to speak with you
frau chauchat looked ten years older than she was—as usually happens when amateurs try to capture character
and brotherhood of fidelia, with its great overture in c played before the final scene
recently arrived in ephrata was a young man named herr ludwig, who was skilled in the art of music and held singing classes, and beissel loved to sit in on his musical lessons
both doctors, head nurse von mylendonk, madame chauchat, and the valet were present
but it was unthinkable that she would have reminded young ziemssen, for instance, of his anniversary in february, though the thought probably occurred to her, since her unhappy head was filled with useless dates and facts and she loved keeping track of other people’s affairs
what a fine and gallant conclusion for them to draw!
longhaired goats leapt from ledge to ledge, watched over by a young shepherd, who stood farther up and wore a little hat cocked over his brown curls, the brim rolled up at the back; he leaned against his long staff, grasping it tightly in one hand, setting the other to his hip
but once the word had been recognized, it did not seem appropriate for someone to relieve him of it, to do what we sometimes did and call it out to him in jovial helpfulness
then he examined me and said that everything was going splendidly, but that i should drink mineral water, because i might be just a bit anemic
she founded a sunday school, for example
she turned red and cowered in her seat, feeling as if every eye were watching her
and, propping herself with one hand on a sofa cushion, she rose slightly, since she was not yet sure whether manners required that she stand up

good heavens, i’m a sensible woman, with both feet planted firmly in life, i’ve matured
upon my honor as an old adviser to this family, i know what such a constitution can do
those people knew how to honor death
this earnest, industrious, but chipper man with a rough exterior and no social graces whatever, this man who devoted himself to his work with a dogged sense of duty—this man was alleged to have committed a serious offense, not just once, but repeatedly
they quoted alexis de tocqueville, who had said that two streams flow from the wellspring of revolution-one allowing men to build free institutions, the other leading to absolute power
it only kept me from having to close up shop
with his most devoted compliments and kissing your hand most affectionately, he remains
by noon, streamers were already flying at the table where gänser, rasmussen, and kleefeld sat, and several people—round-eyed marusya for instance—were wearing paper hats, which were also on sale at the limping concierge’s desk in the lobby
gerda looked from one to the other with a rather ironic expression on her face
afraid sometimes of being alone with him, emotionally alone, tu sais
tilting his head forward and to one side, hans castorp followed the whole procedure, but was soon lost in thought as he regarded joachim’s upper body, the way the ribs—thank god he still had all his ribs—rose under the taut skin while the stomach fell with each breath he took
even if, should it be god’s will, his situation were to change and he were no longer in a position to surround you with all these things?
not outside, not at the door?
i don’t know what became of her
he spoke of how easy it would be to divide the lot, emphasized the responsibility he had to his brother and sister, and insisted on a price of thirty thousand thalers courant, whereupon he was forced to listen—with some nervousness, but also with relish—to yet another well-turned rebuttal by herr gosch
the first time he tried this maneuver, she measured him with her eyes, from top to bottom, quite brazenly and without the least embarrassment, while still some distance off; but as she drew nearer she turned her face away indifferently and walked right by him
it was supposed to be a galop, with drum and cymbals to accentuate the strong rhythm, but the other, muddled masses of sound were out of sync, either ahead or behind—a brassy, jangling, insufferable, naïve hullabaloo of growls, blasts, and twitters, and, above it all, the mad fitful tootles of the piccolo
was he satisfied with her answer?
but how delighted i am now to meet you after all
and then i have the vague feeling that one would do better to study metaphysics in germany
and what is this fixation he has about work?
he ran his hand over the smooth, polished surface of the piano, let his eyes glide shyly over the faces of all those present, and, encouraged a little by the gentleness shining in his grandmother’s and aunt tony’s eyes, he began in a low but slightly hard-edged voice:  the shepherd’s sunday song’ … by uhland
i at least did so and endeavored to pay our timorous nackedey the same tacit respect, although adrian, given the complete inattentiveness of his nature, may have always merely tolerated his devotees' ovations and offerings
it was most regrettable that the local public gave him almost no opportunity to prove his theory
and then gradually, from moment to moment, the passionate tone had opened up, swelled, unfolded, grown ever brighter and more radiant
flushed with festivities celebrated between epiphany and ash wednesday at all sorts of public and private affairs, in which i, still a youthful high-school professor from freising, participated either on my own or in adrian's company
let me touch in devotion your pulsing femoral artery where it emerges at the top of your thigh and then divides farther down into the two arteries of the tibia!
it was whispered to her what she had to do, very softly, but quite clearly and distinctly
it’s all so cruel
the olfactory membranes covered an extensive surface; his ears stuck out and were movable, so that they not only played a role in facial expression but also were more adept at catching sound than at present
but when it came time for the funeral—when the whole crowd of relatives, acquaintances, business friends, delegations of grain haulers, office personnel, and warehouse workers filled the rooms, stairwells, and corridors, and every hired carriage in the city stood below on meng strasse—he reappeared, to the genuine delight of the consul, even bringing along his wife and his three grown daughters: friederike and henriette, both very tall and very lanky, and pfiffi, the youngest at eighteen, who was very short and very plump
they heard the first double door open, and in the next moment they heard the latch of the inner one
but then, why did it occur to me?
just among us, it’s even possible that the skin’s task of protecting and defending us may go beyond the merely physical
someone brought a menu from the dining hall, so that several people, both men and women, could try at once, and for each contestant there was an audience keeping a close eye out and someone waiting to grab the pencil being used
but i realized that it left me unstable, erratic, out of control
he had not planned to take this trip particularly seriously, to become deeply involved in it
when she left, nepomuk cried a little, but then promised always to be good until she came to fetch him again
as a child—my god, how tiny she must have been as a child—therese weichbrodt had called herself sesame, and had retained this mutation of her name, allowing the better and more studious of her charges, both boarders and day students alike, to call her that
he was a poly his tor, who could talk about anything and everything, a philosopher of culture, whose opinions, however, were directed against culture insofar as he affected to see all of history as nothing but a process of decline
he loved to smoke it with a good jug of merseburg beer as a nightcap
and then we’d all blow cigarette smoke in his face
occasionally they would all look at one another and suddenly recall what had just happened
i cannot take this any longer, he said, and, supporting himself on pieces of furniture that stood between him and the door, he limped out of the room
arise, go thy way, my good man
yes, i must admit this is the first time i’ve heard about these
the senator shouted, slapping hanno’s cheek with a lightly rolled-up notebook
you maintain that the morality of christian economics, with all its beauty and humanity, creates men who are not free
in those days, the eyes, protected by a third, blinking lid, were at the sides of the head—except for a third eye, of which the pineal gland was a vestige, that was able to patrol the upper air
she had probably only mentioned that previous renter in order to put words to her own guess· and find out more or less with whom she was dealing
no one has ever seen even a speck of dust on him, he never allowed that, his whole life long
herr albin decided to ask what holger’s status and profession had been in life
so, and why not?
from the moment she had realized she was overblown, just picturing what he would do had set her laughing
ah, pah-we will manage in any case!
he could have prevented it, but his influence had not even been put to the test
there is nothing particularly remarkable in her reaction, not when one takes into account how very much the behavior of women—and you may well smile that at my tender age i generalize about women in this way—is dependent on the behavior of a man toward them
and this earned him another rebuke from his father, for speaking in such disparaging tones about the authorities
and there he would sit in its shade-the people at the farm soon found they could leave him to his vacant dozings-on the same circular bench where bawling barnyard hanne had once practiced rounds with us children

he walked to meet the demands of honor, went through the motions required by the force of circumstance
erature and music-after which the destiny of art proved to be an even deeper, more alienating rupture between what is good and easy, admirable and diverting, progressive and generally enjoyable
he mentioned the jerusalem evenings and her sunday school; employing all his rhetorical brilliance, he reviewed the long, rich, and happy life upon earth of her who had now gone to her heavenly reward—even the word end had to have its adjective, and he concluded by speaking of her peaceful end
madame krauseminz takes good care of her and sees that she doesn’t starve
most certainly not, what a foolish undertaking that would be
but he’s not here just for the fun of it, by the way, because in addition to a proper mucus obstruction caused by alcohol, it appears to be a case of a malign tropical fever, intermittent, you see, protracted, chronic

i could not help accentuating my farewell with the mention of his name-his first name, as was natural for me
do freemasons believe in god?
as they are leaving, however, and still standing in the doorway, frau permaneder turns around once more
what he forgot was the respect he owes me and our family name—he never understood that from the very beginning
although klothilde buddenbrook was not much older than her married cousin—she had just turned twenty-one—there were already pronounced lines in her long face, and her hair, which had never been blond but more a mousy gray, was parted and drawn back tight to complete the picture of an old maid, a state with which she was quite content and which she did nothing to remedy
habit arises when our sense of time falls asleep, or at least, grows dull; and if the years of youth are experienced slowly, while the later years of life hurtle past at an ever-increasing speed, it must be habit that causes it
to the absolute, to the broader application of categories
before going to sleep, whether lying in the grass or curled up in a chair, he would also put out his hand to shake as he said, night!
she was one of behrens’s private outpatients, and the director had commended her to the cousins’ charity
crude sets of stairs formed from protruding roots and jutting rocks led from one tier to the next, and at each level white wooden tables, benches, and chairs were set out among the trees
at their very first meeting, in fact, the supervising physician had found him very anemic, and in consequence of all this, it now appeared that the length of stay that he—hans castorp—had originally planned could no longer be regarded as sufficient
it must have been during our early years at school, though the exact moment cannot be determined, when he ceased to grant me that intimacy and, if he addressed me at all, began to use my last name-whereas it would have seemed to me impossibly harsh to reply in like fashion
a loose woolen jacket, a kind of peacoat that buttoned high and thus required no cravat, worn with any ·old pair
my, but you are being hard on me, herr behrens
lactantius, whom constantine the great chose to be his son’s tutor, put the question quite directly: how would it help him gain his salvation if he knew the sources of the nile or the ravings of physicists about the heavens?
but is it only his?
it’s sad—the way the firm fell off in the last twenty years
and grabbing hans castorp by the arm, he pulled him over to the rows of dark glass plates; he flipped a switch
but the most bone-chilling sound is the appli-
these creatures have fixed their rigidity on the outside, not as a framework, but as a house, and the fact that it is external and not internal must be the reason for such beauty
i’m sitting in the pensée room, which serves as our sitting room
the dancing would get much more lively as the evening progressed; countless patients from the various sanatoriums and patients living brazenly on their own at the kurhaus or other hotels would join in later in much greater number than now, and many a serious case had danced his way to eternity here, first tossing back the beaker of life and then hemorrhaging one last time in dulci jubilo
and so forth, little johann said
and it was all so different, so totally and blissfully different from that glance at his boots—it was a stroke of good fortune, a turn for the better, indeed for the best, an unparalleled event almost beyond comprehension
you see, i am overcoming my legitimate reserve and am already practicing this rash form of address
he howled and began to drum both fists on the table, setting all the dishes rattling and dancing
they had all joined in the laughter, mainly out of respect for the head of the family
would the gentleman like to speak with the young lady?
the sun and the waning moon both stood rather high in the pure blue
but an argument carried on as if it were a matter of life and death, and with such wit and polish as if it were not, but merely an elegant competition—and that was how all disputes were carried on between settembrini and naphta—such an argument is, in and of itself, quite naturally entertaining to listen to, even for someone who understands little of it and only vaguely comprehends its significance
but now, one morning at first breakfast, quite surprisingly, out of the blue so to speak, he had a fit, a seizure, arousing general commotion and bringing the entire dining hall to its feet
yes indeed, his own body might be venomous, but he had kept his mind healthy and uninfected enough to defy naphta’s priestly views concerning the body and to ridicule what he called the soul
doubtless they constituted a significant plus for his final exams, of which, to be sure, he spoke disdainfully, though he was in the midst of preparing for them
and what do you know: sitting there next to his stepbrother in the back seat of the high, wide, overstuffed carriage, he crossed one short leg over the other, and proved quite conciliatory and cordial
and capitalist europe wills its own, as well
a new house, a radical change in his outward life—that would mean packing, moving, refitting his life, casting aside everything old and superfluous, the detritus of years past
but no more than half an hour
then as a discharged soldier restored to his teaching post in freising
the mark of such a neurotic descent into the depths of antiquity, of the secret psychological state of such a town, is found in the many
and again, his last drink with his friends, the st john's farewell, has all the marks of ritual, is presented as another last supper
i had indeed begun to suspect that you had departed when i saw your place vacant down in the refectory
you go to classes when you feel like it, quite voluntarily, you sit down and listen just like in the theater
but taking of nourishment’ is basic physiology, and to tell someone to savor’ it is pure sarcasm
to repeat, i felt happy to know that i was in the same situation as he, and not left to sit behind the men now guarding our nation
he thrust his head forward like a bull
so heavy was the weight that in comparison they seemed diminished, impaired—which not only the sly observer noticed, but also, without doubt, those involved, both the two frail hyperarticulate gentlemen and the grand stammerer himself
it appears first in what is probably the most beautiful of the thirteen brentano lieder, all composed while he was still in leipzig, in the heart-wrenching song: oh sweet maiden, how bad you are, which is totally governed by the motif; and then in the late work, with its unique blend of boldness and despair, most especially in lamentation of dr faustus, which was written in pfeiffering and displays to an even greater extent a tendency to present those melodic intervals in harmonic simultaneity
as he lies in remote, feverish dreams, lost in their heat, the patient is called back to life by an unmistakable, cheering voice
since my parents were in the leverkiihn's circle of
those are the trombones!
he left half his cocoa and refused the egg; his mouth still wrenched with pain, he made some sort of sound that might have been a goodbye and ran out of the house
but what did i hear a few minutes ago?
there you are surrounded by both business and professional men, where everyone can hear you, and you say, seen in the light of day, actually, every businessman is a swindler’—you, who are a businessman yourself, a part of a firm that strives with might and main for absolute integrity, for a spotless reputation
she met mamselle jungmann on the stairs to the third floor and whispered something to her in a strained voice
what hindered him from doing so was an inherited and ingrained sense of family, which meant that he looked not only to the past with a reverent interest in its intimate history, but also to the future; his thoughts were influenced as well by the loving, expectant curiosity with which his friends and acquaintances in town, his sister, and even the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse regarded his son
introduced into the bloodstream, they brought forth results we considered quite astounding, simply because we were not used to equating protein and poison
but as the child was of flesh and blood and it being conditional that i might love no human creature, so did he slay it without mercy and to that end did use my own eyes
not because he wanted to defy his father, or hurt him
the wind, by the way, was at his back, and somewhat to one side, so there was little reason to turn around and take it head-on; and this consideration, added to his obstinacy and his basic oh, so what!
around ten o’clock the sun would appear like a wisp of softly illumined vapor above its mountain, a pale spook spreading a faint shimmer of reality over the vague, indiscernible landscape
frau stöhr’s affectations were dreadful to behold
hans castorp appeared to have joined the quietists, who claimed that to act was an affront to god, who alone can will to act; his activities during this week, at any rate, were limited to a visit with behrens
with many apologies, they carefully put it back in its proper place
she runs—as a lady is not supposed to run
just above the secretary hung a painting in muted colors, a depiction of an old-fashioned marketplace and a church, and in its steeple, a real clock had just struck ten in its distinctive tones
but you must explain one thing for me, he went on
he was still flushed and had just lit a cigar to reward himself
why, if i may ask?
there was proof enough that it did so in his restatement of ideas adopted from kretzschmar about how the sensual was not to be disdained in art, and not just in it-plus many of his remarks about wagner and such spontaneous comments as the one about the nakedness of the human voice and how older vocal music had compensated for it intellectually with the most confounded artistic devices
but you see now, don’t you?
what sort of stature do i have—judge for yourself
not long after he left, joachim would appear, already dressed by then, to say good morning and ask his cousin about his seven o’clock temperature and inform him of his own
during this period, ice-packs and cold dousings of the head were prescribed morning therapies, and they proved more useful than those that had preceded them, although only as palliatives whose mild effect did not justify any talk of recovery
the same applied to joachim
and the wind, the west wind, which had been playing in the trees in st mary’s cemetery and driving the dust in little whirlwinds along the dark streets, no longer stirred
it also irritated me that bullinger, the manufacturer, was among those invitedauthorized solely on the basis of his high income-tax bracket loudly to blow off steam about the weightiest cultural issues
the fact is, i had wanted him to notice, and remember, even then—otherwise i would not have said it
in reality he was already badly battered, and was struggling against his incipient sensory muddle—but in a muddled and feverish way
dour spruces, symmetrical and gigantic, stood solitary and in small groups along the bottom of the gorge and farther up the slopes
she claimed by far the largest share of the furnishings for herself, her daughter, and her granddaughter
i do not suppose, he said, you were expecting me to burst into moral indignation and fits of rage
something to help me sleep
well, castorp, i don’t want to be like that, and so i’ll return you to human society
through a glass door, opposite the windows, a columned hallway was visible in the semidarkness, and to the left of someone entering the room were wide folding doors that opened onto the dining room
the ring is not quality gold, and it is rather small, i notice
it was generally known that he was tipsy as hell, a man in a highly lambent state, who did not care who noticed
yes, well, as far as it’s in my powers and to the extent i have any influence
she laughed a great deal and likewise spoke russian, only russian
would you please be so kind?
he concluded, and throwing his head back, he downed his burgundy and champagne in two great gulps
and then he went on to speak of clerical demagoguery, of the absolute lust for power that condescended to rouse the denizens of the underworld when the gods quite understandably did not wish to hear from them, and suggested that the church was apparently more concerned with the quantity than the quality of souls saved, which indicated a profound lack of spiritual nobility
this so-called benefactor of mankind talked a fine game about purification and sanctification, but in fact he was bent upon the emasculation of life, wanted to let it bleed to death
she was an old woman, a woman from a different time, with a different way of looking at things
you could almost say: if that’s all it wants, then in god’s name, let it have it
and yet no one felt all that easy about the word, even if it was a standard word for their cheerful comrade, dr krokowski
in a word: hans castorp had found courage up here—if courage before the elements is defined not as a dull, level-headed relationship with them, but a conscious abandonment to them, the mastering of the fear of death out of sympathy with them
it’s very becoming for clavdia
and how’s it going?
and, indeed, there in the shadows little christian lay huddled on the padded bench that encircled the middle column
there was a bleeding entrance wound below one eye
we’ve been up here together for so long now—seven months, if you stop to count—which isn’t all that much by our standards up here, but when viewed from down below, now that i think back on it, it’s quite a long time
as for hans castorp’s case, the optical and acoustical results corresponded as precisely as one could ever demand of science
we assert, we recount, that he had
and then the way he would slip in those quotes from heine and other poets, even when talking about the most practical matters, about business or civic issues
hans castorp had not slept much that night
as for yourself—you’ve always been rather anemic, am i right?
joachim asked in a low voice after a while, although he had not actually seen hans castorp consult his thermometer
you call them grand’ and i call them intimate’—what they’re called doesn’t make any difference
at last everything was in order
the physical harassment whose victim he had been for so long-the gastric catarrhs, the throat infections, the agonizing migraine attacks-had vanished
and those are the commitments between which we have to choose at present
and then followed the question as to how permaneder intended to act in light of these facts
the books lay piled high on the table with the lamp, but one was on the floor mat next to his lounge chair and another, the one hans castorp had last been reading, lay across his stomach, its weight making it very difficult for him to breathe, although his cerebral cortex had sent no order to the appropriate muscles to remove it
everything could truly have turned out differently, had he not been such a lame sonny boy and clarissa had found in him a more dependable support
the lawyers, however, were gentlemen who, in his opinion, understood nothing about such matters, they lived in a different world; and, proceeding from a totally different perspective, they judged him guilty of fraud—a verdict backed up by the power of the state
he had tried to bring up the subject of this latest death with his tablemates, but had been met by a unanimous rebuff so sullen that he felt both chagrined and outraged
or rather, in light of our duty, our holy obligation—for example, the debt of honor incumbent upon me to turn with a most cordial heart to you, so small but full of character—a gin, my love!
we did not have to wrest the revolver from her; she had dropped it, or rather thrown it away, in the direction of her victim
now hans castorp lifted his head, and without having to search, his eyes looked in the right direction
well, we all will belong to it sooner or later
she cried several times and demanded that they play beethoven’s erotica at his graveside
not only a disgrace, but probably also an act of stupidity
for the ascetic spirit—if he might be permitted a tautology—the spirit that denied and destroyed the world, was nobility itself, the aristocratic principle in its purest form; it could never be popular, and indeed the church had been essentially unpopular throughout the ages
fine, i am ready to accept responsibility
tony walked slowly and rather gingerly toward the glass door
but the infection hans castorp knew was going round had even influenced the freemason’s clear intellect, robbing him of his laughter, leaving him seriously vulnerable to the inflammatory charms of slaps exchanged in the name of honor; in addition, though he had his good days, which were more like teasing setbacks, the old affirmer of life had turned gloomy watching the inexorable deterioration in his health; feeling intensely ashamed, he cursed it and despised himself when it forced him to take to his bed every few days now
but it’s getting late, the senator said, flipping open the cover on his pocket watch
just a girl of course, armgard von schilling, who lives over there, the one i told you about
religion and ethics were related only insofar as the latter was the former in decay
do you mean your husband, perhaps, my child?
he rinsed his eyes and washed his hands, combed his hair and set his clothes to rights
one day she had a very nasty attack of stomach cramps—right after friederike, henriette, and pfiffi buddenbrook had proclaimed in unison that the hagenströms were the cream of society
messengers scurry in all directions and pay a visit as well to the fisherman, who recollects
it was only out of great desperation that he had managed to utter the word damned
there was still light in her room
they were ill, both of them—all the same, it certainly showed what peculiar social customs young people had up here
the mood was very lively at the good russian table, where the first pop of a cork was heard from the champagne being served at almost all the tables
the young lady's father had been a high-ranking judge, up in bayreuth, and had bought himself an electric automobile-that had been the start of all his troubles
and, gasping for air, exhausted, stiff, and sweaty, he dragged himself across the red-brick schoolyard and pushed his way inside through one of the swinging doors with its pretty panel of stained glass
that, that, that, is his love for her!
we europeans can’t wait
if i’m not sadly mistaken, you can’t be all that blasé, either, given what went on before, you purple-cheeked widower with your lifelike oils
but adrian's relationship to art was too proud and critical for him to have wished to let his light shine in the darkness
do you catch cold often?
and now just imagine, my good engineer, and you my fine lieutenant, what i, the son of such a father, must suffer in this damnable and barbaric place, where my body shivers with cold at the height of summer, even as my soul is constantly tortured by debasing sights
that would be, we repeat, not only possible, but when viewed in the spirit of a tolerant relativism a la when in rome, it might also be considered legitimate, healthy, and respectable
he accused him of a 'lack of intelligence' -avec que/que raison, for bruckner was indeed a simple, childlike soul lost in his own majestic, figured-bass music and a complete idiot in all other matters of european culture
very kind of you, he said, adopting formal pronouns himself, and it was the correct thing to do
and then, too, this grandfather’s seditious conspiracy, or so they were told, had been bound up with the love of his fatherland, which he hoped to see free and united—indeed, his subversive activities were the fruit and outcome of that honorable affection; and however strange this mixture of rebellion and patriotism might seem to both cousins (accustomed as they were to equating patriotic feelings with preservation of the established order), they did have to admit in private that as things had stood back then, rebellion might very well have been commensurate with civic virtue and sober loyalty with idle unconcern about matters of public order
obtuse frau stöhr went on and on in this way with ghastly thoroughness until the brief, if ample meal was over
and with that he stood up, squared his chair back into its place, and turned toward the door
the pulse was rapid
the unrest and conflicts in both  and the present year of  had cost the firm as well
my heart falters when i think
our friends had been ceded a truly extensive realm on the ground floor, including a living room the size of a salon, which had two windows and a stone floor (but so did all the other rooms in the house), was cool, shady, a little dark, and simply furnished with wicker chairs and horsehair sofas, but was indeed so large that two people could live there, separated from one another by considerable space, each pursuing his business undisturbed
even when he wasn’t busy, herr brecht thought it incumbent upon him to let his patients wait a little
and, then, i’m not all that rash about forming opinions
at the next two parties he still had to attend, he would presumably do much the same thing again
but he had no time to worry about that now
he quickly got to his feet, grabbed his large gray hat from the table, kissed her hand, and hurried out through the glass door
and would you believe that i’ve laid them out thirty-two times in a row now, without being able to get halfway through even once?
what title did she wish, did she claim?
then he told about how when playing the piano as a lad, long before he knew anything about brahms, he had come up with a motif that was almost identical with the highly romantic horn theme in the final movement, without, to be sure, the rhythmic trick of the dotted eighth following the sixteenth, but melodically in exactly the
a chivalrous and high-spirited man, peeperkorn repeated without picking up on the remark about naphta, although—permit me a qualification—although not without his prejudices
he was also an officer in the reserves—and served enthusiastically
took off for daghestan, i heard
and then there was caustic little naphta, who was bound to strict vows—and such a freethinker that he came close to being a libertine himself, making the italian look like the dupe of virtue, so to speak
—and rapp replied, oui, sire, plus que le grand!
then, deeply moved, she would stand on her tiptoes and place an expressive kiss on tony’s brow, making a soft popping sound
and frau grünlich was so overcome with spasms of contrition that she tossed her hymnal aside and left the room
please understand me now—if it were nothing more than muffled tones and scars on your aeolus’s bellows there, merely some calcified foreign matter, then i would send you packing to rejoin your lares and penates, and not worry one whit more about you
if the senator’s widow had remained here in town, she would have retained her station and rank in society and kept her fortune here as well—and the family name would have retained a little of its prestige
and so did my grandfather, he thought to add
do any of you know, he asked, what it’s like when you’ve drunk too much brandy smash?
and it may cost the government a few windowpanes, that’s all
i’m not afraid of failing, i’m afraid of the whole brouhaha that goes with it
to be honest, i expect to be frequently delighted by our visitor, don’t you?
i have no idea what you may know or suspect about the present situation
with words that float up out of-if not to say, degenerate into-a spectral, ghostly world ?
rowed upright piano, always buried under music, some of which he had written himself
frightfully pale, he had the same reddened eyes of everyone in the house, and although his mouth was closed, his tongue flicked back and forth mechanically against his lower lip
of all those present, only dr ting-fu, wenzel the czech, and the medium herself had not known the person now named
i beg your pardon?
his demeanor was open, detached, and urbane—all of which was not lost on frau permaneder, particularly since he courteously directed his comments almost exclusively to her

he kept his seat
i would never have taken their bombast so much to heart as i did, had it not provided frosty intellectual commentary to a scalding experience of art and friendship-by which i mean, the birth of a work of art near to my heart (near to me because of my friendship with its creator, not because of itself-that i dare not say, for to my mind there was something far too off-putting and frightening about it), of a work that was taking shape with feverish speed there in that lonely, all-too-homey rural retreat and that strangely corresponded to and stood in intellectual congruence with what i had heard at kridwiss's
his heart was pounding

they knew that he had found a job in london with his former boss, mr richardson, and that recently he had sent a telegram containing the absurd wish to make fräulein aline puvogel his wife, which had met with the sternest rebuff from madame buddenbrook
christian, however, gazed at his sister from one side with a mixture of mockery and misgiving, as if he wanted to say, can you really justify that?
yet he loved adrian very much, was truly devoted to him; and adrian did not hold the rebuff against him, and was generally quite tolerant of his foibles-about which schildknapp could laugh himself as welland was much too grateful for his genial conversation, his tales of his father, and his english foolishness ever to want to hold a grudge against him
just as she had accepted all things in this world, poor klothilde, her cousin, now accepted gerda’s departure with gentle calm

not only in the environs of pfeiffering (or pfeffering, the spelling could indeed vary) was there a communal bench set atop a hill-not, however, called mount zion, but the rohmbiihel; not only was there a pond like the cattle trough-here named klammer pool-about the same distance from the farm and likewise with very cold water

you’ll have to do it all by yourself now, she said
a convoluted process, the italian said with a laugh
but when you looked at mynheer peeperkorn—and the secret pull in his direction was irresistible—where was the nerve, the lightning flash, the current?
once he even spoke softly about what a disgrace it was that he had to spend it this way—but then, to mollify him, added that he didn’t know himself how to take better advantage of it, since experience had taught him to avoid extensive exercise here
what kind of scholar remained u�decided for a long time, but even as a boy his whole moral demeanor, the way he expressed himself, his formal decisiveness, even his gaze, his facial expression, never left a doubt in my father's mind, for example, that this branch on the leverkiihn family tree was called to

she called into the dining room, raising her voice
for their part, these wives of jewish publishers and bankers looked up to him with that profound admiration their race has for german master blood and long legs, and took great pleasure in giving him presents-the sporty socks, belts, sweaters, and scarves he wore were presents for the most part, and had come not always totally unprompted

it is a matter of simple justice, which you have ignored in the most outrageous fashion
lauritzen was an honest man and a splendid merchant, no question of that; but he was merely middle-class, solidly middle-class—why, his father had fished the pickled herring from the vat himself and wrapped them up in paper before handing them to cooks and housemaids
or is it because things have gone uphill until now, and the turning point has come, the slippery turning point, midsummer night?
his arrival seemed the most natural thing in the world—justified both by his old acquaintance with the berghof residents and his relationship with naphta, which despite profound differences of opinion was evidently characterized by regular and very lively visiting back and forth
but for god’s sake, don’t tell my father!
nevertheless, as long as i was still at school with him, i could follow his progress literally from day to day

something no one could have known anything about this morning, beg the consul’s pardon
freedom is the law of brotherly love,  settembrini says, and that sounds like it comes from his ancestor, the carbonaro
it was something in between the two, a phenomenon borne by matter, like the rainbow above a waterfall, like a flame
i began, not all too diplomatically, but with trusting naivete, by admitting straight out that clarissa had preferred death to a life of dishonor, but the clergyman, a robust man of god of the best
the first question i answered with a yes

in his best days, grandfather had a good , at his disposal
morten lay on his side, turned toward her, his chin propped in one hand
they all felt it—most bitterly, of course, the gentleman in question, who twirled his sweeping moustaches while he searched for a counterblow, giving his foe time to engage in further attacks against classical models, against the rhetorical literary tradition of european education and schooling, with its mania for grammatical form, which only served the interests of bourgeois class domination and had long since become an object of ridicule among the masses
the mere mention of the word theater’ makes me happy
in her chaste country garb-a habit of olive-green wool that was a testimony to clerical stricture, with a bodice that was studded with two closely set rows of metal buttons, closed high at the neck, flattened her youthful bosom, and fell to a tapered point over the wide full-length gathered skirt, its only ornament a chain of old silver coins worn under the ruche at her throat-the brown-eyed maiden sat beside the invalid and like a schoolgirl intoning a litany, read to him from texts to which the parish priest would certainly have had no objection: early christian and medieval visionary literature and speculations about the world beyond
i learned that adrian was looking for a text for an opera, and that already, years before he seriously approached the task, he was considering love 's labour's lost

he took charge of the bank at first, but quickly gave it over to herr albin, remarking, if they understood correctly, that its duties prevented him from freely enjoying the occasion
exhaustion asserted itself generally after so many vigorous hours spent in the wintry mountain air
and here she came, he heard her footsteps, her dress trailing behind; she was beside him, she was holding a letter by one corner and waving it back and forth in the air, and she said in her pribislav voice: the concierge is gone
stern and majestic, frau permaneder leaned back in her armchair—and the smiles of the ladies buddenbrook from breite strasse became a shade more caustic
they petted her, comforted her, kissed her brow, and sent her to bedfräulein levi declared she was willing to spend the night with frau stöhr, since that limited lady was so frightened that she did not know how she could ever go to sleep

and, as hans castorp happened to notice one day, this fellow’s eyes were staring in the same direction as his own; like his own, they were fixed fondly—and shyly and insistently, if not to say fawningly—on madame chauchat’s supple body
now your papa has to go to work
he went so far as to celebrate the human body as the veritable temple of god, whereupon naphta declared our stuff to be nothing more than a curtain between us and eternity, which resulted in settembrini’s forbidding him ever to use the word humanity again—and so on
the card game was over, although no one had troubled to gather up the cards and money from the table
as it was high tide, it read, and the ships of the northern line had arrived, we were having considerable difficulty working our way among the other boats to our landing, and it happened that i was standing on the edge of a scout, my feet braced against its oarlocks and my back against our ship, as i tried to bring the scout in closer; unfortunately the oaken oarlocks against which my feet are braced break off and i tumble into the water
and that i can tell you how absolutely perfect those narrow cuffs look at your wrists, and how i love the way light silk billows around your arms—arms i know well
but you don’t have to know a single one of them to condemn the lot
to tell the truth, now that i stop and think about it, my bed—and by that i mean my lounge chair, you understand—has proved very beneficial over the last ten months, made me think more about things than i ever did in all my years down in the flatlands, i can’t deny that
for the sake of propriety they’ll order a little something to eat, a couple of marinated mushrooms or a piece of sturgeon, and chase it down with drink, quite to excess
he fell silent now, scowling, with eyes lowered
of that leipzig bamboozlement, i would have known to put a good face on things-no, but rather the reader should find in my feelings a characterization of adrian's nature and essence, for which the word
and they did just that, which won them the respect of their dumber, lazier classmates
i’m incapable of taking part in another learned conversation today, let me tell you that ahead of time
they are probably ashamed of the old ceremonies, see them as uncivilized hocus-pocus—and for good reason, since it really would be rather preposterous to dress atheistic republicanism up as a mystery

on mühlen strasse, he entered a house painted a yellowish ocher and climbed to the second floor, where a brass plate on the door announced brecht, dentist
they might have said:
a few guests cast glances my way that asked how all this was intended and how i could justify it; and perhaps i should have intervened and broken up the gathering-but on what grounds?
and wherever he went he exuded the oily odor of spirits, and some boys said that he drank kerosene
you called director behrens that once before
his favorite lesson consisted in teaching them the woodland green, during the singing of which several students were sent into the corridor so that they could echo, very softly and carefully, the last word of the chorus’s intoned we wander so merry through field and wood
his pocket watch said half past three when he was awakened by a conversation behind the glass partition on his left
i did not like those chills yesterday evening, and today there is in fact a little pain in one side and a shortness of breath
i serve suffering humanity
no event had been omitted from even her own brief past: her birth, her childhood illnesses, her first day of school, her enrollment in mademoiselle weichbrodt’s boarding school, her confirmation
there are judgments that pro-

henning kurz from becker grube was too old—it was high time for some fresh new energies
but here my eye is upon the fate of her gentle and sad sister inez, who cultivated the past and sorrow-as well as upon poor rudi schwerdtfeger's fate, which i recalled in horror just now when i could not refrain from speaking ahead of time about solitary adrian leverkiihn's involvement in these events
you didn’t see him, the way he was grabbing at her, and how drunk he was
i know all i need to know about you, my good man
good morning, my friend
herr kesselmeyer stood there somewhat confused, his hands buried in his pockets, musing absent-mindedly, his two yellow cone-shaped canines pressed to his upper lip
he got along best with the senator, who knew how to steer the conversation safely to politics and business and thus avoid any accidents
even though he was as sparing as always of his presence, whenever that threadbare gentleman did turn up, he was prepared to share in those long country walks that adrian loved to take, especially when he could not work, and that riidiger seasoned for him with bitter and grotesque humor
monsignor hinterpfortner and i certainly can no longer be alone in this dreadful and at the same time-god help us!-secretly uplifting realization
she requested that he not continue his attempt, that it was not a matter of her understanding the role he had accepted
i had to smile at the odd depth of feeling with which the composer accedes to the yearning for the sweet life of the south awakened by the immortal bird in the soul of the poet of the nightingale-since in italy adrian had never shown much enthusiastic gratitude for the consolations of a sunny world that lets man forget  the weariness, the fever, and the fret-here where men sit and hear each other groan
how, on his part, that fiddler and whistler would react was a secondary issue that i hardly found unsettling, since his boyish ambition had achieved its goal, his concerto
i was annoyed by your detachment, and that you were on such good terms with him for the sake of your own egoistic experience

farewell, my dear tony
that does not mean that i am offering you the brotherhood of informal pronouns—i was about to do so, but have reconsidered

we do not know if he should be exonerated because circumstances favored his lack of good intentions—that is, if one chooses not to speak of his bad intentions
read it in the score yourself!
oh, good god, it made not the least difference if it was true or not
autumn had settled in now
there must be some mistake here
you really should be able to understand and appreciate how under such circumstances a person might not be so tough-minded or find it perfectly natural for people to be so cruel—normal people, you know, who stroll about and laugh and make money and stuff their bellies
the deceptive thing is the epicanthic fold, or a variation on it, that you find among certain races, an extra piece of skin that begins at the flat-bridged nose common among such people and falls like a pleat across the lid down to the inner corner of the eye
not everyone in europe knows how to pull it off
how often had he looked at it and pressed it to his lips during the time that had passed since then, bringing forth its changes—changes, for instance, like getting used to life up here without clavdia chauchat present in a shared space

she was not crying now; she looked about her with curiosity
you must excuse me
i am considerate of what is popular, but samiel is foolish, and
it had been a good six weeks away when hans castorp had first been surprised to hear talk about the holidays—as long, if you stopped to count, as his originally scheduled stay plus the period he had spent in bed, which, as hans castorp looked back on it now, had seemed a very long time back then, particularly those first three weeks, whereas the same number of days now appeared to add up to very little, almost nothing
johann could never understand how, at the end of the school term, any teacher could bring himself to say something like: and we shall pick up here after summer vacation and then move on to this or that… after summer vacation!
i’m very fond of you, fonder than of anyone else i know
yup, ’nuff t’ floor y’!
he had, after all (as old man kretzschmar himself put it) sat in english, french, and italian opera houses-that had been music for the ear; beissel's, however, sounded deep in the soul and was no more and no less than a foretaste of heaven
at the next table on their left was an adolescent boy—still of school age, to judge by his appearance—whose coat sleeves were too short, and who wore thick, circular glasses; he chopped up everything heaped on his plate until it was a pasty hodgepodge, then bent over it and wolfed it down, now and then pushing his napkin up behind his glasses to dry his eyes—it was unclear whether this was to wipe away sweat or tears

and senator dr langhals arrived as well, with his wife, long-time friends of the family; and köppen the wine merchant—no forgetting him—with his large, ruddy face set between two overstuffed shoulders, and his equally stout wife
what a happy, friendly sight it was—the way the older lads worked with the unskilled, curly-haired boys, helping them string their bows, showing them how to draw and take aim, supporting them when they reeled back laughing from the recoiling bow as the arrow left it with a whir
i had no reason to doubt the pain with which he cried out,
dr langhals asked, searching little johann’s face with his conceited eyes
at the sight of the beautiful boy-while his indulgent big sister looked on, obviously expecting nothing else, having grown accustomed to everyone's falling in love with the youngest of her family
let me note just in passing, by the way, that the pretty first edition of clemens brentano's poems from which adrian worked was a present from me, a little volume i had brought to leipzig for him from naumburg
tony was so looking forward to life in a big city and had expressed her desire to live in the heart of hamburg—where herr grünlich’s office also happened to be located, on spitaler strasse
nature, settembrini said, lowering his voice and no longer speaking over his shoulder but merely looking down at it, certainly has no need of your spirit
because the truly sad part is that she’s not really trying to live at all

abstract, that the human voice may be-the abstracted human being, if you like
the first step toward true freedom and humanity would be to cast off your quaking fears of the term reactionary
and it dare not be different with any of us
just consider for a moment—nothing happened at all!
he stared out the dormer window; a certain obstinacy could be read in his ordinary, blue eyes
it was impossible for me to dispute it
you’ll have no complaints
and so frau stöhr,fräulein engelhart, young kleefeld, her girlfriend with the face of a tapir, the incurable herr albin, the young man with the saltcellar fingernail, and various other sanatorium residents would stand there with mouths pulled down at the corners and snort through their noses as they watched him gaze in one particular direction—a forlorn and passionate smile on his lips, the same flush on his cheeks that had appeared his first evening here, the same glint in his eyes that had been enkindled by the austrian horseman’s cough
he whispered with exaggerated fervor, so that both miss robinson and the teacher glanced at him in amazement
his face had turned quite red in the course of dinner and he was huffing and puffing audibly
but he was no less attentive in trying to influence the boy’s mind and provide him with vivid experiences in the practical world for which he was destined

you’re going out there, jean?
frau permaneder could not get beyond that drastic word—it was as if it possessed her completely
the cousins met in the corridor and went downstairs
the mountains reverberated, the valley boomed with it, and hans castorp was certain it would bring people running
herr gosch spoke this last word with his teeth clenched especially tight, and then continued, oh, one cannot deny that the whole affair has its sublime side
she’s always longed to go to heaven, frau permaneder concluded, drying her eyes
since joachim’s departure, hans castorp no longer sat at frau stöhr’s table—the same table that had been abandoned by the late dr blumenkohl and where marusya had sat, stifling her unfounded mirth in her orange-scented handkerchief
i didn’t want to ask for fear of leaving myself wide open
researchers had been able to isolate and concentrate the toxins from several such microorganisms and were amazed to find that, if injected into an animal’s bloodstream, even tiny doses of such materials, which could be classified as simple proteins, produced the most acute toxic effects, leading to rapid demise
but hans castorp could not get the cough he had heard out of his mind and kept repeating that it was literally like looking down inside the horseman; and as they entered the restaurant, his eyes, weary from the trip, had taken on a glint of nervous excitement
when herr grünlich entered the pensée room, tony was standing there with the bronze watering can in her hand
ah, he could still feel a little sand from the beach in his high-buttoned shoes—he would ask grobleben to leave it in there, forever
do you understand ?
at some point he would have had to admit that, given his pedagogic streak, his own masculinity was not of a strictly social, cock-of-the-walk nature, either, which explained why the grand peeperkorn was as much a disruption to his meditations as were naphta and frau chauchat; and finally, he could not hope to disabuse his pupil of the effects of a personality and superior nature, effects from which neither he nor his partner in cerebral matters was able to exclude himself
my dazed state transfer unto your person the chill of fever against which i have wrapped myself, and behold you merely but to see its source m you

in fact, he felt as if he had only just now reestablished a connection with yesterday, as if he were taking in the whole picture again, as it were, which had not really been the case since he awoke
he waved above their heads
in short, my situation is, i think, correct; it corresponds to the general state of affairs and in particular to my own sincere regard for your person, mynheer peeperkorn
he was simply not a hero, which is to say, he did not let his relationship with the man be determined by the woman
those were happy, easygoing times back then, when my grandfather’s crony good old jean jacques hoffstede strolled about and translated little off-color poems from the french
you were only waiting for mother to die, so that you could …
strange, how it looks like a bad conscience-homophonic music's bad conscience in the presence of polyphony
this morning she was wearing her dark-red dressing gown, its color exactly matched to the tones of the wallpaper above the wainscoting, its texture softer than the softest cotton, and its large-flowered print embroidered everywhere with sprays of tiny glass pearls in the same hue
the fact is, the account of the first three weeks of hans castorp’s stay with the people up here (twenty-one days at the height of summer, to which, by all calculation, it was supposed to have been limited) has consumed quantities of space and time that correspond only too well to what the author himself expected, and indeed half confessed; the coverage of the next three weeks of the visit, however, will require about as many lines—or words, or even seconds—as the first three weeks required pages, quires, hours, and working days
with a few suggestive phrases, he could turn a prosaic everyday scene into stark reality, so that they all shivered when he now spoke of the ice-cold water in the sponge that you pressed to the back of your neck on such a morning—and called it holy
what he felt was the satisfaction of a sufferer who has always known only shame and the bite of conscience for hiding the suffering that cold, hard life brings, and who now, suddenly, from the hand of a great and wise man, receives elemental, formal justification for having felt such suffering in this world—in this best of all possible worlds, which by means of playful scorn was proved to be the worst of all possible worlds
it’s not a pain, really, it’s an ache, a vague ache, because all these nerves here are too short
the consul emerged from his office, his quill behind one ear, just as brother and sister entered the passage, and he stretched his arms out to his daughter
and i realized that he understands me so well, respects me so much more than the others that he can call me a name, a name that one of your warehouse workers wouldn’t even call a dog
what was a day, measured for instance from the moment you sat down to your midday meal to the return of that same moment twenty-four hours later?
i would have wished to see you go in some other way, but it doesn’t matter
oh, but wait, that isn’t what i wanted to say, that isn’t what i want to reproach you for
the boy named teddy, to take just one example, was no longer a boy one day—though of course that did not happen one day, but emerged out of some quite indefinite day
i think the world and life are such that people ought to dress mostly in black, with a starched ruff instead of your military collar, and deal with one another in a serious, muted, formal way, always keeping death in mind—that’s how i’d like it, that would be moral
and indeed, there was in what he played for us more than enough reason besides for praise and joyful amazement!
each pops softly, and in between she says, you good chawld
since you wish it, that’s how it will be
although one’s general metabolism increases, the body stores the protein
you did a nice job with that, iwersen
which means that you’ll have to pry and pull four times?
do you know what that means, my good engineer: to be lost to life’?
when they merely wanted to say:
it would have been different had it been work, some worry or trouble, that interposed itself—his mind could not have overlooked or bridged that sort of thing quite so easily
settembrini said, the gentlemen are in high spirits—and with good cause, good cause
but i am falling into my old bad habits and getting ahead of myself
and what efforts we have made since then—all the sweet triumphs, the fine coups now and then
understanding had not exactly prevailed, neither the country nor the artistic sort, but just the wild fear of townsfolk for their social standing, and the young lady had literally writhed there on the floor in front of her parents, pleading and sobbing, while they cursed and shook their fists, until finally she had fainted dead away along with her mother
who convince themselves and others that what is tedious has grown interesting, because what is interesting has begun to grow tedious
but catarrhs are not colds, they come from an infection to which one is already susceptible, and the only question is whether what we have here is an innocent infection or one that is less innocent, all the rest is twiddle-twaddle
but no sooner had consul hagenström stepped out into the street than he turned to his companion, the broker, and engaged him in what was obviously a very lively discussion
yes, that was peculiar—but at the same time hans castorp was astonished that he found it peculiar, and the uneasy feeling that had sent him searching for advice and support rose up inside him again
when herr grünlich departed that evening, he had only strengthened the impression left behind on his first visit
you must play it again soon
the consul would immediately cut him off with an icy remark
he had placed an opened old testament against the back of the boy in front of him, and he read from it now with a look of total innocence and thoughtful concentration, then stared at a spot on the wall and provided a wretched modern german translation of what he had read, pausing frequently to give a squeaky cough
and we’ve always spent his salary
times of tempest and trouble
as the house stands
he wore a cinnamon jacket with broad lapels and leg-of-mutton sleeves that closed tight just below the wrist
herr settembrini, who realized that all possibility of human exchange, of a democratic chat or perhaps even argument, had now been cut off, flung one hand above his head in his gesture of despair and resignation
you’ve got a good thing there, something really solid
dates were known and recorded for this ancestor: duly entered were the dates when he had a case of boils and when he had genuine pox; there were tidy entries for when he had fallen from the fourth story onto the drying-room floor, and lived to tell of it, although he struck a great many beams on the way down, and for when he had been delirious with a high fever
an american woman died here the day before yesterday, joachim said
the quartan fever had been fierce that morning, in all three of its’ stages—the chill, the hot flush, and the sweats—and peeperkorn’s little pale eyes gazed out dully from under the idol-like tracery of his brow
yours is acute, but harmless
so much for now about the daughters, adrian's housemates, with whom he soon established friendly relations
for her part, tony raised her shoulders just a little, laid her head back, trying all the while to tuck her chin against her chest, and greeted them as if from unattainable heights, her glance brushing past julie möllendorpf’s broad-brimmed, elegant hat
he experiences headaches, and his mind feels numb, edgy, and dazed, with occasional spells of dizziness
my uncle is very apoplectic, you see—stout, hardly any neck
which only made his father’s voice sound that much louder when he interrupted
don’t hang on to the piano—fold your hands in front of you and stand up tall
joachim, whose temperature had likewise shown a welcome decline, had seconded this invigorating change of schedule and had not disagreed with hans castorp’s suggestion
at most, her smile and voice suggested the kind of excitement that comes when the first words in a long, silent relationship are spoken at last—a subtle excitement secretly incorporating into this one moment everything that has happened until now
what do these people want?
they have been called up, these comrades here, for a final push in a battle that has lasted all day, to regain that hill position and the burning villages just beyond, which were lost to the enemy two days before
and you are making a fool of yourself with your little love affairs, with your buffoonery, with your sicknesses, with your remedies for your sicknesses
his exams had meant a long period of concentrated work, and upon returning home he looked paler than he ought—even given his general type
revolution and preservation—they looked to peeperkorn as he trudged along with his hat pulled down low, hardly cutting a particularly grand figure as he tilted to one side with each step; they watched him jerk his head in jest toward the combatants, and heard those wide, irregular, ragged lips say: yes—yes—yes!
but for a moment hans castorp could see across the room to a waxen profile against pillows, a young man with a sparse goatee, who slowly rolled his very large eyes toward the door
just as things had once gone between elia naphta and his rabbi, so they went now—teacher and student did not get along, religious and philosophical friction increased, grew worse and worse
joachim had sat down on a kind of cobbler’s bench, facing a panel, against which he now pressed his chest, hugging it at the same time with both arms
you gentlemen will have to excuse me
oh, papa, she said softly, her lips barely moving, looking back now, wouldn’t it have been better if …
that happened here, in his parents’ home, across the way in the drawing room, in front of the middle window, and it was old pastor hesekiel who baptized him, the same one who almost got himself shot by the french when he was a young man, for preaching against their looting and burning—he’s been resting in the lord for a long, long time now
a blind man would have noticed how things stood with him; he had done nothing to keep it secret
he drank like a fish
that's the thing-you are not thinking of time in its courses, you are not thinking historically when you complain that some one or another could have it entire, joys and pains unending, without that his hour-glass had been turned or that at the end his bill be presented him
a partial payment, kesselmeyer
or they would make general remarks about how undignified and vain it was to dye one’s hair, or inquire all too sympathetically about how jakob kröger, elisabeth’s nephew, was doing
one can at least put it that way
now is not then, here is not there—for in both cases motion lies in between
for as the clock struck, once, then twice, the charming patient had slowly turned her head, and a little of her upper body, too, to gaze plainly and openly over her shoulder at hans castorp’s table—and not just at the table in general, no, quite unmistakably and very personally at him, a smile playing on her closed lips and in her narrow pribislav eyes, as if to say: well?
then he had set out for the funeral in riga, had returned with his brother-in-law, tiburtius, who had spent several days with the family of his dear, departed wife and had even visited christian in the hospital in hamburg
i find it most instructive to follow your train of thought
and had she told her parents about it?
the little hand tripped along paying no heed to the numerals as it came up on them, touched and passed them, left them behind, far behind, and returned to come up on them again
he had been sitting there drumming his fingers on the table and twirling his moustache
heliotropic as science says of life-forms
why had they approached him with this proposal just now, prematurely rousing him from sensible resignation, filling him with doubt and indecision?
premièrement l’un et maintenant l’autre
that is not what i wanted to say
david was already no less stultified and alienated from his origins-if not to say, grown no less brutish-than solomon
hans castorp mulled this over as rapidly as possible
they attended an ice-skating contest, a bobsled race—for the winter sport season in our alpine valley was in full swing
kesselmeyer, you’ve eaten at my table…
instead, the more they talked the more confused i got
for although silly enough, they placed what we had heard under a soothing and accepted aspect, the aesthetic, which, however inappropriate,
they simply belonged to the fixed schedule of a normal day, and ended the main rest cure with an apostrophe
he spoke the c of coffee far back in his throat, as if already tasting and swallowing it
how goes it, lad!
the doctor came to look at him
he took the violinist's instrument from him, and having first turned it around in his hands to establish its origin, he improvised quite grandly on it, even inserting, just to make us laugh, a few bars of the cadenza from his violin concerto
i remained in munich for two days to say goodbye here and there and to supplement my gear with some minor items
but we ought to have made a million long before this, he said, his voice edgy with excitement, his hands trembling
and since, as he had noted, hans castorp was looking robust and really quite splendid thanks to his stay at the sanatorium, which had gone on much longer than expected, he assumed that his nephew would be returning home with him now
why, you’re asleep, joachim said
oh no, it won’t turn out all right
if only there had not been something in that sublime exercise of intellect that kept one in a state of constant anxiety
hanno’s gratitude to his teacher was boundless, and he abandoned himself to his guidance
interrogation under torture, what did the gentlemen think of that?
he was in charge of the sanatorium, its highest authority—and hans castorp’s heart felt a restive longing for paternal authority
have you firmly resolved the matter?
and as winter set in and then lost its fury again, thomas buddenbrook’s new house rose above the roomy cellars
i’ve just returned from a situation that is much sadder, let me tell you
the consul felt an irresistible need to go back upstairs and see about the ladies
development had been a small part of the �onata, a modest refuge for subjective illumination and energy
a great many noble and prudent minds have detested tobacco smoke
all i have to do is make a few payments and advances here and there, and patience and respect will be restored
you have already experienced the advantages of such a relationship
and so bourgeois imperialism, accustomed now to victory, could not warn enough against anarchy,
i’ve used it with you all along, and will for all eternity
opiates are the devil’s tool, for they create dullness, rigidity, stagnation, slavish inertia
a k ferge, the simple martyr to whom all higher things were foreign, had held such a ghostly hand in his own hand one evening and had determined by touch that it was well formed and whole, whereupon, by some means he could not quite describe, it had withdrawn itself from his grip, which though hearty had been quite within the bounds of respect
i assure you that the whole mood was shot to hell
i don’t always remember everything that may burst from my lips
publicly, i shall stand quite aloof from the whole affair
i have taken a couple of rooms at the city of hamburg inn … and here i am, antonie, to hear from your own lips that last, decisive word that will make me happier than i can possibly express
the league in which you claim we stand, has itself to do with love, you ninny
i’ve already made it clear to him how he behaved, thomas, she interrupted, sitting up and laying a hand across her breast, more than clear, let me tell you
yes, you shall have your look at the state of my affairs, nothing can escape your eyes
a narrative, then, can set to work and deal with time in much the same way as those depraved dreams
but i ask you, it’s almost eight years now since i’ve seen him—and under the circumstances
the one a piano teacher, the other an active partner in a visceral enterprise, that is to say, in a firm that produced sausage casings
the horses of the funeral coach were shrouded in black, with only their restless eyes visible
the lamps were extinguished, the curtains flew apart, anemic daylight filled the room, and cold foggy air poured in through the wide windows
material, it is the person himself-and so hardly suitable for artistic segmentation
at present he was busy supplementing an english-german dictionary that he considered inadequate
no sooner would she take time to catch her breath than new words were gushing and surging out of her
and are you going to accept?
that’s what people call a passion, i believe
i love my violin and have come rather far with it, but i value the piano more
it was just like a day many years before, when hans castorp had been privileged to hear a world-famous singer, an italian tenor, from whose throat the power of grace-filled art had poured out over the hearts of men
but that could be demonstrated only if a chill was also present—otherwise the skin remained hot
it turned out that they had mistaken a precipitate of gypsum for protoplasm
what about you, christian?
herr gosch was not doing well; with a lovely, sweeping gesture he rebuffed any assumption that he should be counted among life’s fortunate
but the consul returned alone again and walked over to herr grünlich, who was standing at the window staring out into the rain, his hands behind his back
for a slightly tipsy young master of the muffling art with an abnormal skin condition, who was no longer totally lacking in experience when it came to illicit matters, this was a speculation that bore the stamp of logic and truth and, far from being absurd, seemed as perfectly obvious as it was illuminating
partial payment, my foot!
but that only seems to be the case
they quoted herr stengel: you were asked to draw a line, and what have you done?
what have i ever done to him?
yes, it’s almost too beautiful, tony
she was quite aware of her obligations to her family and the firm, was proud of those obligations
well, i later rendered that service to my friend and like to think back to that evening and our first exploratory conversation on the subject
honored friends!—this humble rhyming
settembrini, the italian corrected him with particular verve, accompanied by a facetious bow
hans castorp was angry at the italian, and at himself, too, because it was his own lack of self-control that had provoked the gibe
what folly, what a misconception!
it’s an honor to meet you, herr grünlich
but recently—it must have been, wait a moment—probably eight weeks ago—
he, too, was often confined to bed; the cracked-porcelain sound in his voice rattled more loudly now when he spoke, and as his fever rose, he spoke more—and more caustically and cuttingly than ever
but then, although tony was not present at his farewell visit, herr grünlich left for hamburg
but there’s so little love in you that you never once visited me—not once—when i was lying there in the hospital in hamburg, struck down by rheumatic fever
and i realized that nothing was keeping me there, and that it would be a disgrace to stay
and so when tous-les-deux—the pallid, black-clad mother from mexico—happened to meet the cousins in the corridor, she expressed her gratitude, chiefly by a series of mournfully becoming gestures, and in her clanking french asked for them to receive in person the thanks of her son—de son seul et dernier fils qui allait mourir aussi
what did he have to say about it today?
only one i would not and will not hear, for it is a most certain spiteful slander and befits me not in the least
that clear, fresh voice reaches his spirit wandering along strange, hot paths and leads it back to cooling shade and peace
life could cancel itself by such means, then there could be no possibility of informed life
in a gurgling voice with a serious impediment, he would address hans castorp—as he did all the patients—by his room number and then proceed to rub him down with alcohol
and, to cap it all, at almost the same time that b grünlich went bankrupt, something even worse happened at dahlbeck & co, where jakob worked in hamburg
the old woman asked after a pause
he always was concerned about his body, much more than i, or at least in a different way than i, because i was always the civilian, and more interested in a nice warm bath and good food and drink, when what he wanted were challenges and exploits
and for whom should he have gone to any trouble?
are you going to go, hans?
you may well imagine that many topics of conversation offered themselves as we dined; but no sooner was the soup course ended than we left old anecdotes behind and proceeded to more serious and fascinating subjects
the senate had already proposed the latter
it has a castle and a cathedral, where one is shown the tomb of kaiser otto i i i , adelheid's grandson and theophano's son, who called himself both emperor of the romans and saxonicus, not because he wanted to be a saxon, but in the same sense that scipio took the name africanus-that is, because he had defeated the saxons
it was the theme, the first theme again!
but the tone, which is no more, for which, as it hangs there vibrating in the silence, only the soul still listens, and which was the dying note of sorrow-is no longer that, its meaning changes, it stands as a light in the night
and what are you reading, fräulein buddenbrook, if i might ask?
this was a significant decision, which, as i saw it, was uniquely stamped with destiny and which in some sense both annulled the recent past and reconnected with our common life from long ago, with moments whose memory i bore in my heart: with the time when i had found the lad experimenting on his uncle's harmonium, and, still farther back, with our singing canons with barnyard hanne under the linden tree
and from under his fingers came a swelling, blossoming, interweaving melody, from which arose in elegant counterpoint—at first only sporadic, but then ever more clear and vigorous—a great, old-fashioned, wonderful, and grandiose march, which moved toward a climax, intertwining, modulating, and finally resolving as the violin entered fortissimo
true, i have learned something about life, but that just makes the prospect of sitting around here at home like a silly goose all the more depressing
here one likewise experienced how behind a contemporary f��ade the depths of time are constantly interposing in soft ghostly tones, and not without also confronting the eye with enduring architectural tokens and even picturesquely breaching the present now and again in historical masquerade, in the folk costume of halle, in the garb of ancestral salt-workers
joachim’s feet seemed very large, his legs very thin—and they looked as if they had been wrapped, more for sport than for any military reason
hans castorp sat half propped up in bed, his head tilted to one side and a blurry look of fond devotion in his eyes, and he listened now to the harmonies drifting in through the open balcony door—though not without a mental shrug at the thought of settembrini’s babblings about music being politically suspect
life is not squeamish, and cares not a fig for morality
before she even had time to read the name, a gentleman appeared in the room—wearing a bell-shaped coat and pea-colored trousers
mynheer sat with his jaw slack, his hands palm down on the plaid traveling blanket spread over both his and clavdia’s knees
it was a baroque idea, but one deeply rooted in his nature-composed of arrogance, a recluse's shyness, the old-fashioned german provincialism of kaisersaschern, and an explicit cosmopolitanism
by autumn at the latest, he said, frau salomon would be back again—but then for good
whereas death had scorned christian and would only continue to tease him with fifty little tricks and pranks that would command no one’s respect
the pleural lining is covered by flesh, isolated, inaccessible—for good and all
they won’t obey my will, you see
the tonal space it provides is too limited
the same thing has just happened with you, my good engineer
he is the chief of police…
herr dieckmann, however, did not quite understand what he’d said, and so began to rattle off his menu
i can indeed depend on my good memory; moreover, right after reading the draft i put several things to paper for myself, in particular the passage about apostasy
and he wept … and in the next moment he no longer knew why he wept
nevertheless, he would have been unable to leave his dressing room if he knew he had left something undone or had done it a little too hastily, for fear of forfeiting that sense of freshness, calm, and wholeness—which he would lose in any case within an hour and would then have to patch and cobble as best he could
pastor pringsheim, who had pulled on his wrist-warmers, began to speak again
gerda is at the casino—for a violin concert by tamayo
he now set them on his lap on such occasions, which both parties found just as delightful, even more so
it hasn’t emptied out entirely yet
’mid these halls with laughter chiming,
i did not tell him that it was in fact he who was politicizing things, and that nowadays the word german was in no way synonymous with intellectual purity, but a party slogan
that much is perfectly obvious
and the main thing is that mother will not be upset by my taking such a step—no more today than she would be a year from now
once the dilation of the stomach had been cured without any alleviation of the headaches and severe attacks of nausea, he began to assign more and more of the ailment's symptoms to the brain-bolstered in this view by his patient's desperate need to be kept out of the light
but never wash them first, dear—the blood has to go in, too, mercy sake
this effect is preceded by a kind of bold running start in a dramatic parlando-an obvious reminiscence of the first violin's recitative in the last movement of beethoven's a major quartet-except that the grand phrase there is followed by somethi;g quite different from a festival of melody in which the parody of being carried away becomes passion of such serious intent that one feels somehow embarrassed
i may be forgiven for a more or less randomly directed polemic, but i regard it as barbarism, as inhumanity, to term as soullessness such longings for a soul-the longings of the little mermaid!
but in the darkness into which he fled to escape confusion, he could hear settembrini’s voice droning on in praise of literature
for as she charmed me, so did she work her charm and yielded to me in love-and i was initiate and the promise sealed
world, a far more european space than the political colossus to its north, where the word international has long been spoken as a slur and where gloomy provincialism has fouled the air and turned it musty
we first have to let darkness wash over our eyes to see anything—that’s obvious
deeply worried, i asked myself what efforts, what intellectual tricks, detours, and ironies would be necessary to save art, to reconquer it and achieve a work that as a travesty of innocence could still confess the state of comprehension from which it would be wrested!
the consul stood in front of her—appalled, dazed, close to shock—and said nothing
their inedibility is known throughout the natural world, however, and they are secure-sadly secure
tacked to the wall above it was an arithmetical etching that he had found in some curio shop or other: a so-called magic square, like the one visible in durer's melancolia-along with hour-glass, compass, balance scales, polyhedron, and other symbols
he walked over to the glass door leading to a narrow veranda and gazed out at the soggy front yard for a few minutes
while day after day, in a constant state of silent agitation, i have faithfully attempted to do justice to my biographical task, to give worthy form to intimate and personal matters, i have simply let happen those outside events that are part of the age in which i write
his conduct, to be sure, never dissuaded me from my observation that from the very first day he dearly loved his little nephew, that the boy's arrival had brought a radiant daylight into his life
he is well known for his method of rhythmically modifying a fugue theme in the very first answer, in such a way that, although the thematic is strictly maintained, it can no longer be recognized as a repetition
this incurred the censure of sor alfo, who felt that in so doing the jurist-quest' uomo, he would say on such occasions-was presuming a bit too much
just lazin’ through my day,
finally they left the room to make way for an old woman, a disagreeable creature, who kept rubbing her toothless gums together and had come to help sister leandra wash and dress the body
moreover, not satisfied with just composing a hymn entitled to the fatherland for male chorus, he even wanted to dedicate it to the german kaiser
you were taking your life in your hands—a devil on the right, a devil on the left, how in the hell were you supposed to survive?
yet another guest, the art historian and diirer scholar, professor gilgen holzschuher, made me feel uneasy for similar reasons that i find it hard to justify; and that was doubly true for the poet daniel zur hohe, who was also often in attendance-a gaunt thirtyyear-old clad in clerical black up to his tight collar, with the profile of a bird of prey and a hammering way of speaking that went something like:  indeed, indeed, not bad, no doubt at all, one can well say that!
he did this with a metal whistle whose tone was adjustable by a screw and that could produce a frequency so high that the human ear barely perceived it even at close range, whereas its effect on the quite differently evolved eardrum of a dog was very powerful, even from astonishing distances, and kaschperl would keep still as a mouse whenever the secret tone that no one else could hear pierced the night
but now hans castorp realized to his amazement that the flush that had come to his freshly shaven cheeks had not subsided, or at least the warmth that had come with it was not about to depart—the same hot, dry face that had bothered him yesterday evening, and that had disappeared while he slept, was back now in full force
in any case, those words had spoken of liberated music's never extinguished homesickness for origins still bound to the cult; and beethoven's violent attempts at the fugue had been those of a great dynamic and emotional spirit wrestling with an ingeniously cool compositional form that upon its knees had praised god, the orderer of the cosmos and all its many rounds, yet all the while had been caught up in another world of passionsstrict, highly abstract, ruled by numbers and a chiming relationship with time
but then she continued, as lively as before, but, tom, you really needn’t see it that way
but god gave you both a child, the consul said, deeply touched
it all belongs to the realm of the intellect and has nothing to do with either of you personally, which is the only way something can be an insult
his name would be called out and he would stand up and not know a single line—and there would be a scene, a loud and terrible catastrophe, no matter how good a mood the professor was in
and jurisprudence, the making and executing of laws?
only the briefest, highly compact musical moment is genuine and serious
let me tell you something, he said in conclusion—they had arrived in joachim’s room, and his cousin was getting ready for rest cure
having again consulted only a leipzig street directory, he now sought treatment from a certain dr zimbalist, who resided on one of the commercial streets that converge at market square
there really is some resemblance—i’ve never been in a monastery, but i can imagine it’s much like here
his nose looked like a little flat button between his protruding cheekbones, and his gray eyes squinted and blinked in all directions a little stupidly, although at certain moments they could unexpectedly grow larger and larger, sticking out until they almost popped
it’s certainly prettier than if your name was jack or joe
let me feel, my child
say what you like, there is something pleasant about waking of a morning in a large bedroom with lovely, cheerful wallpaper and finding that the first thing you touch is a heavy satin quilt; and it is exceptional to have an early breakfast in a room opening onto a terrace, with the fresh morning air drifting in from the front garden through an open glass door, and to be served neither coffee, nor tea, but a cup of chocolate—yes, every morning, a cup of birthday chocolate, with a thick moist piece of pound cake
she expatiated on the pleasures of coughing—yes, there was something perfectly delightful and enjoyable about a tickle in the depths of your chest, that got worse and worse until you reached down deep for it, squeezing and pressing to let it have its way
remarkably enough, both our pastor, the reverend rector zwilling and
after a proper period of silence, he replied, my good engineer, i have not the remotest desire to disconcert or offend you in your protestantism
old buddenbrook repeated with a giggle
i’ve always been a great concertgoer, he said
and the closer election day drew near, the clearer it became that he and hermann hagenström had the best chances
and he wasn’t even wearing an overcoat
what do you know, she’s emerged from beyond the caucasus again
his hands, however, were genteel and long-fingered, with beautifully shaped oval and convex nails; and the finished effect was so undeniably that of a gentleman that he could dare to wear his informal street clothes to affairs where evening dress was the rule-and at such receptions, women preferred him just as he was to his rivals in correct black and white, and one would see him surrounded by females whose admiration was undisguised
his father was born on a norwegian ship, and ended up a captain on the same line
we no longer need indulge ourselves in dialectic extravagance for your sake
it was both tender and full at the same time—and cool, one could only presume
but if i use it, then i feel i’ve done my duty and that everything is in order; my conscience is clear, and i feel calm and content, and swallowing is absolutely effortless
timm sat down beaming with pride, and dr mantelsack apparently jotted down satisfactory beside his name
but on foot, how far is it then?
you relieve yourself noticeably—the same thing happens to you that happened to judas iscariot when he fell headlong from the bough—your bowels gush out
he was absent too often because of illness and was totally inattentive because his thoughts would linger over some harmonic relationship or some unraveled marvel in a piece of music that he had heard his mother and herr pfühl play
for long before i dandled with that poisonous moth, my soul, in its conceit and pride, was upon the road to satan, and my datum was fixed that i should strive after him from my youth on, for as you must know, man is made and predestined for bliss or for hell, and i was born for hell
but what i think is that it’s well-nigh—ida still used words like well-nigh—past time for advising, my child
what a shame, joachim said
you’re not really serious, are you?
what do you think, for example, of h c f burmeester & co in hamburg?
as light increased now early in the new year, adrian's health improved visibly, the series of tormenting illnesses that had confined him to his bed now halted abruptly; psychologically he appeared to have overcome the foundering of his life's plans and the shocking damage that had gone with it; his spirit rose anew-he may even have had difficulty remaining cool and collected amid the storm of ideas bombarding him, and the year   became the year that yielded a miracle harvest of finest chamber music
does it make you uneasy?
he could hardly put a glass of grog to his lips of an evening without spilling half of it, his arm trembled so damnably
i think a great deal of you, too
not that he had been unable to cover them; the firm had at once shown what it could do, without any hesitation or embarrassment
fine, the sacrifice of blood and fat, salted and seasoned with sweet odors, that once fed god, giving him his body, is for the psalmist nothing but a 'symbol'  (and i can still hear the indescribable disdain with which dr breisacher spoke that word); one does not slaughter the animal, but-as incredible as it may sound-thanksgiving and humility
but you hold on to something only as long as it is rising in value or at least steady
i think of a coffin as an absolutely lovely piece of furniture, even when it’s empty, and if there’s someone lying in it, it’s really quite sublime in my eyes
i definitely have a fever, there’s no other explanation
everyone burst iqto laughter-even adrian, who let his clenched hands rest on the keys and bent his head down over them
the madness of ascetics
but for the moment he was safe and sound, and all the rest could take its course
one could tell from herr settembrini’s expression that he was still busy pursuing his train of thought even after he fell silent
their names were von zutawski, cieszynski, von rosinski, michael lodygowski, leo von asarapetian, and the like
she went in there, then closed the shining doors
from four fountains, close to each other in a row, clear water flowed in various directions,
or think about his fate
and so i died
you men should be ashamed
for hector and aeneas, troy's best men
and then himself climbed in the ocean-going boat
eumaeus, by telling me these things,
even fair-haired niobe remembered food,with twelve of her own children murdered in her home,her six young daughters and her six strong sons
which a craftsman had once planed with skill
who started all this business, not because
by myself and then rub on the olive oil
always asking questions about everything—
my friends, is there some man confident enoughof his own daring spirit to venture outamong stout-hearted trojans, to seeif he can trap an enemy soldier,some straggler, or catch wind of some reportof what the trojans say among themselves,whether they are keen to stay beside the ships,away from home, or to go back to the city,now that they have beaten the achaeans?
around him, his close companions were all busy, in a hurry to get their morning meal prepared
and get all the women in the house to come
who, as they grieve around me, drain my heart, whenever you are not among us
and bright red wine
on the broad back of the sea
and if a man is harsh
escorting mortal men when any man
what form of drama remained, if it was not to be born from the womb of music, in that mysterious half-light of the dionysian?
what each man's destiny will be or not,
that fair-haired artemis would strike at me,
only very few of them are better
be the sort of men who would defend him?
as we recall them
the swineherd will bring me to the city
should welcome any guest in front of him
standing by the altar, prayed to lord poseidon
o my friend, that day menoetius sent you from phthia in agamemnon's cause, he gave you orders
get up now, stranger, and go to the city
oh, how far from me then was just this entire doctrine of resignation!—
to see if you did, in fact, entertain
he slew imbrius, a spearman, son of mentor, who owned many horses
so now, daughter of zeus, tell us his story, starting anywhere you wish
handed it to the wise old woman, who smoothed it out, and folded it, then hung the tunic on a peg
on those murderers of our sons and brothers
the spear struck amphion, son of selagus,who owned much property in paesus, with many crops
both good and bad—i know what's going on
i am finished with you
aided by malicious sleep, have injured me
through that, such an strange idiosyncratic glimpse into the hellenic was granted to me that it had to appear to me as if our classical-hellenistic scholarship (which is so proud of itself) had up to this point known, for the most part, only how to gloat over games with shadows and trivialities
goddess athena with the gleaming eyes replied to zeus:
in aeschylus we acknowledge the union of the frightened zeus, worried about the end of his power, with the titan
calling out to them:
lycaon's fine son saw diomedes moving fastalong the plain, pushing trojan ranks in front of him, in complete disorder
he has, first of all, as a dionysian artist, become entirely one with the primordial oneness of his pain and contradictory nature and produces the reflection of this primordial oneness as music, if music can with justice be called a re-working of the world, its second coat
and weeping, the old man of the sea
from the doors, since i am here by myself
they leapt up to get armour on
but we will not be going back to our estates
they set torches in between,
will say it is a wedding
gleaming-eyed athena said these words and left,
who's been gone so long
what fools you are, you strangers, or else you come from somewhere far away—
i do not care at all if this annoys you
telemachus to speak about his father,
when she’d recovered and her spirit had returned, she started her lament
the gold one stopped that ash spear from aeneas
teucer, son of telamon, master of your people,my dear comrade, keep on shooting as you are doing
with his sons and sons-in-law, to his lovely home
that woman, more than anyone, has covered herself
which seemed to him the finest place to go onshore
with one hand, lycaon grabbed achilles' knee
he cut down twenty trees,
so i gave him a cunning answer:
amphimedon, what have you suffered,
so from your chariots take out of harnessthose horses with their lovely manes, feed them,then quickly bring here from the citycattle and stout sheep
now lies dead—i mean antinous, the one
seduced by his own force and power,
will certainly see to it you acquire
after i would said this, he stretched out his hands to starry heaven
with these words, odysseus pulled socus' strong spear out of his flesh and removed it from his shield
and make things difficult, or odysseus
some god's just told me—he came and stood beside me—that even now
he took the food in his two hands and set it down right there at his feet, on his tattered bag, and ate, while the minstrel sang his song throughout the hall
his dear nurse eurycleia
but i do not think there's one
stand witness, and wide heaven above,
how can i handle those shameful suitors,
get going, you two
with impunity, but he stopped by antinous,
and zeus' child, what a bold man you are!
in all sorts of ways—a courageous warrior,
swift-footed achilles rose to speak:
and i would not miss my parents or my home,
in spite of all their literature on dreams and numerous dream anecdotes, we can speak of the dreams of the greeks only hypothetically, although with fair certainty
so now the god made manifest talks and acts in such a way that he looks like an erring, striving, suffering individual
as soon as you have escaped the dark blue sea
he would laid no hand on his fast, black, well-decked ship
would you support the suitors or odysseus?
for me, if the gods keep me safe and i get home,peleus himself will find me a wife
for as danaans fought, they shed their own blood also
i learned of this
we made it home—
she was the only god present at this battle
so let's think now
whom he included with the animals
as hector spoke, death's final end slid over him
nausicaa gazed at him in admiration,
that we ca not string his bow, it's a disgrace
you wo not want to acquaint yourself with work
listen to me, trojans, dardanians, allies—victory clearly falls to war-loving menelaus
with many noble riches, to collapse
a skilful speaker full of ancient wisdom,
lie there, son of otrynteus, of all menthe one we fear the most
athena, daughter of aegis-bearing zeus, cried out—
mother, do not encourage me to grieve,
and observed what happens, then let him woo
but there are no wide plains in ithaca,
concerning the process just described, however, we may still say with equal assurance that it is merely a glorious appearance, namely, the aforementioned apollinian illusion whose influence aims to deliver us from the dionysian flood and excess
she spoke to him—her words had wings:
sons of atreus: these are, of course, menelaus and agamemnon, for whose sake many achaean kings joined the expedition to troy, because of a promise they had made to menelaus to help him recover his wife, helen
lying on the portico, resting in their beds,
glorious menelaus, everything you sayis true enough
he feels the actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more elated when these actions annihilate their agent
then zeus, to make the fight for his dear son more difficult, spread ominous darkness over that fierce battle
right at the outer gate, with helmet on,
her sisters quickly plunged under the waves
just as a man longs for supper, when all day long a pair of wine-dark oxen pull a well-made plough
to bring about your reconciliation,a dowry bigger than any man so farhas ever handed over with his daughter
in fact, i would have run off long ago
were handling and inspecting it, haggling
at this point,we need to think with prudence
to use the long ladder to come down again
long-suffering lord odysseus answered him and said:
he drew back his long-shadowed spear, then hurled it unerringly
no, it's better to clash in battle right away
she burst out crying, rushed straight up to him, while there gathered round them other female servants of stout-hearted odysseus
with these words, she led headstrong ares from the battle,then sat him down by scamander river bank
when agamemnon saw dark blood flowing from the wound,
and reached the island of thrinacia
from this perfect primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended
and set it in the blazing fire to harden
were eating in the hut, with the other men as well
run into trouble they have brought on themselves
he would set before him
he urged hector, swift ares' equal, to challenge menelaus
if alexander slays menelaus, let him keep helen, all her property
odysseus' dear son jumped up out of bed and dressed
is she still living in the palace halls,
it was my longing for you,
far behind, prayers carry on their healing
in age i can claim to be his senior
so come on now,
encouraged, the wise prophet then declared:
old horseman peleus will not be welcoming me at my returnback to his home, nor will my mother thetis
in all quarters of the old world (setting aside here the newer worlds), from rome to babylon, we can confirm the existence of dionysian celebrations, of a type, at best, related to the greeks in much the same way as the bearded satyr whose name and characteristics are taken from the goat is related to dionysus himself
and perhaps several people remember, like me, amid the dangers and terrors of a dream successfully cheering themselves up by shouting: it is a dream!
and let that expert archer teucer come with him
then he took a massive fleece from a well-fed goat and grabbed a pointed spear
and hateful eriphyle, too, who sold
they all shouted speeches at me
then none of those many danaans there could claim the ends of the line are the most vulnerable
a god dried up the place
the land and forests
glorious odysseus, for your loving care,
brought me here by force
that said, telamonian ajax left
mighty son of atreus, why urge me on?
would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture, having trained himself for what is serious and frightening, to desire a new art, an art of metaphysical consolation, tragedy as his own personal helen of troy, and to have to cry out with faust:
into the middle of the crowd he then brought out the loser's prize, a woman skilled in every kind of work, worth four oxen
the man running off in front was a brave warrior, but the man going after him was greater
when i recall odysseus and think of him,
now we are brawling over beggars
around it poplars grow
apollo was so enraged at niobe,with his silver bow he killed the sons
this feature naturally destroys its nature completely, no matter how much aristotle approved of this arrangement of the chorus
looking like an old and miserable beggar,
with his fine comrades and many treasures
so he can wrap the heifer's horns with gold
where do i go, dear lad?
and yet another man can be so beautiful,
he came up to menelaus
i want to grieve
some fast ship, so all men will be amazed
menelaus, expert at war cries, then replied:
men closed their ranks around him, leaning their shields against their shoulders with their spears extended
woman, be happy about making love
or else her mind had changed
for helios hyperion we will build
in fact, i want her more than clytaemnestra, the wife i married
do as you wish
to begrudge what someone else may get
that makes things difficult, even for a man skilled in speaking
in dionysian art and in its tragic symbolism this same nature speaks to us with its true, undisguised voice: be as i am!
the women all wailed with her
would strike telemachus in his own house
of other things more pitiful than these
who are you among men?
because our fathers were good friends, as well,
around him were assembled shades of all those who would been killed with him and met their fate in aegisthus' house
will rule our home and slaves, battle spoils
of his ancestral house from years ago,
i will also send iris to great-hearted priam, telling him to go to the achaean ships,to beg for his dear son, bearing presentsfor achilles to delight his heart
all sorts of things—like traveling to the towns
when i would finished speaking, teiresias quickly gave me his reply:
prepare a meal as soon as possible
men are gathering up and treading other grapes
of what those suitors were scheming in their hearts
confused, our eyes look after what has disappeared; for what they see has been raised as from a depression into golden light, so full and green, so amply alive, immeasurable and full of yearning
and a crew prepared to take odysseus
flayed from a creature nine years old,
or from a stone
saying this, patroclus led off, and meriones, that godlike man, went too
he shot an arrow  and hit him on his sculpted body armour,in the right shoulder
athena dragged the fast ship down into the sea and stocked it with supplies, all the materials
mighty agamemnon's spear struck against his shield, but the shield could not hold out—the bronze went through,piercing deïcoön's belt and sinking in his gut
medon was a bastard son of noble oïleus and ajax's brother
to be held back here
drank some honey wine, then handed the cup back
eurymachus, if you gave me all the goods you got from your own fathers,
and were carried in the waves, like cormorants,
they might gain a breathing space, something rarein warfare
but the goddess with the gleaming eyes, athena,
and spoke to him, saying:
he will earn you an enormous sum of money,
encourage all your men
our bed, which no one else has ever seen,
saw him, shook his head, then spoke to his own heart:
this land of ithaca, goes to my mistress
the most painful figure of the greek stage, the unlucky oedipus, is understood by sophocles as the noble man who is destined for error and misery in spite of his wisdom, but who at the end through his immense suffering exerts a beneficial effect around him which is effective on those different from him
with its brass floors and high-pitched roof, i think you won’t leave here and go back disappointed,
after this whole courtship, i hope they never
amphiaraus, a man who could rouse people up,
grant that we two come back to the ships covered in glory, after doing something great,something the trojans will regret
let no sceptred king ever be considerate
just as pandareus' daughter,
then antinous addressed them both with this reproach:
but no fear gripped idomeneus, as if he were some pampered child
eager to slaughter us in war, even so,
the rock face rises sheer, the water there
but if agamemnon, son of atreus,or all achaeans learn that you are here,those sons you have left behind will have to paya ransom three times greater for your life
priam, lying at achilles' feet, wept aloudfor man-killing hector, and achilles also wept for his own father and once more for patroclus
not at all—many men have heard of it,
will take away from many excellent men
to the right—an eagle clutching in its talons
standing right beside her, swift-footed iris spoke:
who would match him as a gentle master,
grant that odysseus, sacker of cities,
thus the pair of them continued arguing
then hector of the shining helmet answered her:
behind the mules and wagon
for wise odysseus' return to his own home
and that's why now
mighty son of atreus, agamemnon,ruler of men, it would be far better to worry about all this some other time, when there's a let up in the fight, when the hearthere in my chest is less enraged
the sharp bronze pressed on through the other side,  coming out his forehead
when i was as far from land as a man's voice
but if your heart still resentsatreus' son and his gifts, then take pityon all achaeans, our exhausted soldiers
opened after loosening the lid
of bronze and gold and rich supplies of clothing
in every one two warriors bit the dust, slain by my spear
bright-eyed athena met him—she was disguised
if you are one of the immortal godscome down from heaven, i wo not fight you
to escape in his black ship
but he did not care for my sacrifice
to sleep, and there's a time to take delight
we would come to the well-built home of peleus, mustering men across fertile achaea
their father's sheep and bent-horned cattle
the next i saw was oedipus' mother,
a shepherd to his people, caeneus, exadios, god-like polyphemus,theseus, son of aegeus, all god-like men—the mightiest earthborn men, the strongest
let's rouse the powerful fighting spiritof horse-taming hector, so he challengesone of the danaans to fight him alone,in a grim single combat, one on one
you claim he was destroyed
and so he quickly ran away and then moved across
there i saw high-born tyro first of all, daughter, she said, of noble samoneus,
the people here are not fond of strangers—
i am surprised at that—at dawn yesterday
and i will guide you to men's cities there
she stood close by the famous earthshaker and said:
by those destructive winds
but he failed to reach old age—
do not wake her up
you dogs, because you thought i would not come back from troy to my own home,
all achaeans were then gripped with anxious expectation
when i picked the finest troops for ambush
and now the son i love
and ca not you now rouse yourself to save him,though he's a corpse, for his wife, his mother,and his child to look at, and for priam, too,his father, and the people, who would burn himwith all speed and give him burial rites?
his words had wings:
irus will soon be in trouble, something he brought on himself—he wo not be
great-hearted son of peleus, why ask memy lineage?
to themyou were great glory when you were alive
the men who ate the food this land produced
the noblest form of that other form of greek serenity, the alexandrian, is the cheerfulness of the theoretical man
there is a river minyeïus, which meets the sea near arene
peisistratus, will you promise to do something for me,
so i can give you your gift as my guest,
the spirit had departed, going underground like vapour, muttering faintly
god gives poetic power to your song
my own heart and spirit are urging me,in a strange and fearful way, to go there,to the ships and wide achaean camp
so now i think argives and trojans should part company,since you have suffered many hardships,thanks to the fight between myself and paris, a fight that he began
then raise a massive mountain round their town
so the two best fighters, achilles and the greater ajax, are encamped there
for i say to you, and this will happen,because of agamemnon's arrogance some day gifts three times greater than this girlwill be set down before you
once he sets off in his hollow ship, roaming
so many cattle and fat sheep and drained from jars so much wine
he needed me thereto protect him from destruction
all the men of ithaca will soon come here
but he's a crafty one
he did and ordered us to carve our way
stout-hearted epeians saw the man go down, leader of their horsemen, their best fighting man
you must stay here
we two, pallas athena and myself, have often sworn among immortalsnot to rescue trojans from wretched death,not even when all troy is being engulfedin all-consuming, blazing fire, set offby achaea's warrior sons
most of the day
roused them all to laugh with no sense of control
then he set on the shield a herd of straight-horned cattle, with cows crafted out of gold and tin
he lost his loyal friends on the wine-dark sea and his hollow ship,
and do not ever think about gods' anger
let him in his heart
terrifying screams, as they went at each other
my friends, how far east or west we are
as odysseus said this, they listened eagerly and then obeyed his words
were always in a group
is what they finally did, for it was their fate
from far away has visited my house
full of furious passion, they went at danaans,
he climbed into the chariot
my friend, son of capaneus, come on,get down from the chariot, so you can pullthis sharp arrow from my shoulder for me
six from every ship were killed
like horn or iron, and he kept up his deceit
just as thundering ocean surf crashes on the sand,wave after wave, driven by the west wind's power,one wave rising at sea, then booming down on shore, arching in crests and crashing down among the rocks,spewing salt foam, so then danaan ranks,row after row, moved out, spirits firmly set on war
tell me of noble odysseus' mother
the bronze on achilles' chest glittered like that star,  as he ran forward
then he removed the wondrous mist over achilles' eyes
because i did not welcome you this way
he held a golden cup, poured gleaming wine, libations, on the flaming sacrifice
athena then spoke out winged words of triumph:
or a stronger bond than when man and wife
when loaded down with wine
with a clatter of hooves, the mules moved quickly off, carrying the clothing and the girl, not by herself, for her attendants went with her as well
to get back to your own dear native land
after saying this, he went on board the ship,
had gone there to collect a debt the people owed—
he sailed for ten days on the water, then for seven more,
please rouse yourself to help me return home,
zeus himself addressed them
one man struck the door post of the well-built hall
to view in isolation from the rest
as athena spoke, white-armed goddess hera smiled
against me, blocked my route, and shook the sea in an amazing way
going in close,he took his stand
close to the fields, in reithron's harbour,
his mother went into the house, calling her attendants, who brought together the matrons from the city
laden with bread and meat, as the steward
i do not see you as someone with much skill in competition—
hang on, my heart
take off these clothes,
once, when i was eager to assist you, zeus seized me by the feet and threw me out,down from heaven's heights
the opposite of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to smash the mythical works that surround it
when he returns to his dear native land
but now i am dead
i will tell you something—and this will happen—
the world is at every moment the attained manifestation of god, as the eternally changing, eternally new vision of the person who suffers most, who is the most rent with contradictions, the one with the richest sense of protest, who knows how to save himself only in illusion
behind such a way of thinking and evaluating, which must be hostile to art, so long as it is in any way consistent, i always perceived also a hostility to life, the wrathful, vengeful aversion to life itself
they came to the ships and huts of the myrmidons
this titanic impulse to become something like the atlas of all individuals and to bear them on one's wide back, higher and higher, further and further, is the common link between the promethean and the dionysian
he would made the glittering shield for ajax from the hides of seven well-fed bulls
until the breaking seas had loosened off
so these two talked to one another, as they stood in the house of hades, deep beneath the earth
had had enough of crying and mourning,
any other injury against you
of the phaeacians, who by their descent
we were over there in troy,
my friends, you who believe in dionysian music, you also know what tragedy means to us
that you will kill a cow or sheep
and did so truthfully—i will not hide from you
on her golden throne, the lovely goddess
what cruel god has been attacking you?
his twelve children live there in the palace,
can tell his friends how much we excel
you can do me harm, destroy my manhood
if we know everything which is going to happen, who will want to sit around waiting to see that it really does happen?
mock you here, all of them
now, melanthius, you can really keep watch all night long,
prayers are the daughters of almighty zeus
with this staff as his support, agamemnon spoke:
his companions skinned it, then prepared the meat, slicing it skillfully and putting it on spits
menelaus then drew back his long-shadowed spear, and hurled it
and their dear delicate children to our ships,when we have destroyed their city
with this, the ethical basis of pessimistic tragedy is established together with the justification of human evil, that is, human guilt as the penalty for that sin
after the attending women had washed both men,
so xanthus cried out, calling to the god:
above her head, it spoke to her, saying:
at that point, their quarrelmight have got much worse, but achilles himself  stood up and said:
he's that stranger all the men dishonoured
since the time he left, when i was still a child, no one's looked after them, and smoky fires
but it's impossibleto deal with you, achilles
the bird came close to them, then veered off to the right before the horses
trojans held their spears up high, then turned to face achaeans
and zeus' child, poseidon did not kill me
to telemachus—his words had wings:
every item he would been asked to mention to her,
polydamas, keep all the best men here
this man will take you home
whoever's willing will give me something
we glad of that,
just as in autumn north wind sweeps the thistle down along the plain, and the tufts bunch up together, that how the winds then drove his raft to and fro across the sea
all right, then, do that
thanks to my plans and what i had in mind
when we saw charybdis, we were afraid we would be destroyed
in a black ship over to king echetus,
had ordered him to say
peisistratus, leader of men, stepped up
with this rod in hand, mighty hermes flew away
they told him to bathe there in the flowing river, but lord odysseus said to the attendants:
i could make trojans and danaans hate you, too
telemachus spoke, and everyone endorsed his words
she set up torches and pulled the work apart
what's happened to our sworn oaths, when we claimedwe were the best, the bravest?
they left the two men there, for their fighting days were done, and charged to battle, creating havoc
let's kill the enemy instead
with this idea we think we have, for the first time, reached a true understanding of the original and astonishing meaning of the chorus
with some assertive speech in front of you,
even sun god helioswill not see the two of us, and his rays
those illuminated illusory pictures of the sophoclean heroes are the reverse of that: briefly put, the apollonian of the mask, necessary creations of a glimpse into the inner terror of nature, are like bright spots to heal us from the horrifying night of the disabled gaze
why are you going like this to the ships alone,away from your army in the dead of night,when other warriors are fast asleep?
since he became a roaming wanderer
show me the town
with the remaining ships, which followed me
hector of the shining helmet, still weak, replied:
to which i have come—while you are present here
his skin grew dark once more, his countenance filled out,
so no one robs you on your journey,
he's already done great harm
the third one mixed deliciously sweet wine
and assigned a house
at priam's words, his wife cried out
now's not the time
but in some place far away odysseus
turn even someone really sensible
which you are giving me
felt great joy, happy to learn of his ancestral lands from what pallas athena said, daughter of zeus,
to cheer me up or secure my favour
then the breath of north wind boreas
in their distress they spoke winged words to me:
since you are the younger one,you must begin
when the two men had approached each other, standing at close range, menelaus threw but missed—  his spear point was deflected
our women, too, who wore their girdles low
fine men, who fight in the lycians' front ranks
once she would finished saying the oath, they both set off, wrapping themselves in mist
after athena spoke, she poured sleep on his eyelids
the two ajaxes, attendants of the war god ares,  were willing, meriones, too
as odysseus said these words, a black cloud of grief swallowed up laertes
back to his native land in empty ships,abandoning courageous menelaus
listen now to me
and, lady, that's how i am amazed at you, lost in wonder,
three of his fellows had gone off, herding pigs in different directions
though you will have trouble
just as a strong man with a sharp axe strikes a farm ox right behind its horns,  slicing clean through sinews, so the ox stumbles forward and falls down—that's how aretus jerked forward and then fell onto his back
old man, divinely bred, i ca not sit down
if indeed you are his son
of all of them
you are a disgrace, good only for display
over there, close to him, ask him questions?
it was an omen
the extraordinary courage and wisdom of kant and schopenhauer have succeeded in gaining the most difficult victory, the victory over the optimism concealed in the essence of logic--an optimism that is the basis of our culture
so he will take pity and not ring our city
meriones was the first to speak:
they give splendid presents and do not consume
as quickly as you can urge menelaus,
there were never any waves, large or small
will protect you from all suitors' insults
and all the roads grew dark
stranger, you have been speaking as a friend,
its revelation, being like a parable, seemed to summon us to teat the veil and to uncover the mysterious background; but at the same time this all-illuminated total visibility cast a spell over the eyes and prevented them from penetrating deeper
always to offer nasty provocation,
as soon as dawn arrives,
then, with a terrifying shout, achilles charged, lusting to kill
make sure you act with care—
those who flee help no one, and they get no glory
felt too much pain
by what sap is this parasitic opera nourished, if not by that of true art?
i know what you are saying—i understand
i did not have a large supply of food,
with his bronze spear odysseus killed pidytes from percote
dear wife, what sort of crimes have priamor priam's children committed against you, that you should be so vehemently keento destroy that well-built city ilion?
from all his boars
he would stand far off and shoot an arrow through them
they did not think he would killed the man on purpose
he is my guest,
in the fragrance waves'
your bride can wear it on her wedding day,
then let the wide earth open up for me
but while i was moving through the sacred groves on my way to circe's home, a goddess
she rubbed me with rich oil, then dressed me
so they could not move their limbs or lift their bodies
you have explained this well, exploring all these matters very fairly
with his own wits, unless some god himself
the ones who serve them
astonished, he recognized that all these famous people had no correct and clear insight into their occupations and carried out their work instinctually
other trojans, both men and horses,are being driven back in great confusion,routed by ajax, son of telamon
then, with athena going on board ahead of him,
they quickly rounded up the finest beasts
now he's come and killed our finest men by far
halls, corridors, and courtyards were full of people gathering—a massive crowd,
both sleep and food, for of all achaeans
i carried riches back
a massive ring of mountains round our city
you have got a shovel used for winnowing
till bright-eyed athena cast sweet sleep on her eyes
may prompt him to?
standing by him, theoclymenus spoke—
the soldiers, like a fire consuming all the land,moved on out
so these men occupied themselves with dinner
when sleep took hold of him and eased his aching heart by sweetly flowing round him—for his splendid limbs were tired out from chasing after hector by wind-swept ilion—then poor patroclus came to him as a ghost, looking exactly like him in all respects—in stature, handsome eyes, and voice
other than his wife and one house steward
on his way back, he did some fearful things,with keen support from you, divine goddess
when every man had eatenas much food and drink as anyone could wish,geranian horseman nestor was the first to speak
they senttheir gods' most important holy priests
once i would appeased the anger of those gods who live forever, i made a funeral mound
as he thought about it, it seem to him a better plan to stand apart
then medon, a shrewd man, spoke out
are not we concerned about them any more, as their evil fate accomplishes its purpose?
that would be wrong
penned in there at night
who has sufficient strength to draw a bow
meanwhile, once his group had eaten their hearts' fill of food as sweet as honey, lord odysseus,
so glaucus spoke in prayer
in between these layers was a piece of felt
scowling at hector, swift-footed achilles then replied:
on your painful wanderings
pheidon, ruler of the thesprotians,
for what you have said is gnawing at my heart—
his soldiers amused themselves beside the breaking sea by throwing spears and discus or with archery
o father zeus, none of the other gods
did not bring to fulfillment
will resent us, once they learn about
or by some trick
or tilled or known the work of human beings
go rule your myrmidons
there's the rocky island asteris
the greeks are, as the egyptian priests say, eternal children, and where tragic art is concerned, only children who do not know what an exalted toy has arisen under their hands, something which will be destroyed
on the strings he plucked the prelude to a lovely song
will be carried out
hector then addressed both sides:
others, the ones they saw clearly moving off, back from the fight, they taunted with abuse
who commands the restless sea
the wife of agamemnon, atreus' son,
when it comes to fighting, we are not ignorant
that curse which gives men all kinds of trouble
the other shadows of the dead and gone
with an infinite supply of tasty food
apollo did not disobey his father
the men were already keen to fight, but they took his words to heart and fenced in the ships within a hedge of bronze
for he, according to the experience of all ages, always says i and sings out the entire chromatic sequence of the sounds of his passions and desires
now there's aegisthus, who took for himself
for we are staring at a great disaster
anything that's appropriate for guests
once he came to mycenaeas a peaceful guest with godlike polyneices, mustering men to assault the sacred walls of thebes
to marry whoever is the finest man
put armour on,and quickly
my friends, we are so amazed prince hectoris such a spearman, so courageous, warlike
then achaeans, who breathe fighting spirit, feared for machaon— they thought he might he captured, should the battle change
from his own friends
but not one of those men he would entertained now stoodin front of him, protecting him from wretched death
their lovely voices answering each other
but winds and waves still carried him ahead
but soon the argives by their ships would have reason to remember him
out of their wagon harnesses, then drove them
i think he might bitterly regret all this,  once our army is destroyed
my fame extends all the way to heaven
if you are being sincere in asking me
it delights my heartthat you think of me always as your friend
child of aegis-bearing zeus, untiring goddess, hear me
they hang around our house, day after day,
when the first growth of hair is on his lip,
two vultures sat there,
through her house, rousing my companions,
repeat in public everything i say, so other achaeans will grow angry,if he, still clothed in shamelessness, hopes at any time to deceive some argive
as soon as rose-fingered early dawn appeared,
meriones went after phereclus as he ran off, hurled his spear straight into his right buttock
was with immortal gods, enjoying their feasts
now agamemnon has even shamed achilles,a much finer warrior than himself, stealing a prize, keeping it for his own use
on the left flank of that destructive battle, hector met paris, husband of fair-haired helen, encouraging his comrades, urging them to fight
moving from the surf where it pounded on the shore, he swam out to sea, but kept looking at the land, hoping to come across a sloping beach somewhere
without saying a word
who keeps him there by force
with these words, hector raised his spear and threw it
in a mortal man who lacks my wisdom
here also we become aware of the victory of appearances over the universal and of the delight in the particular, rather like an anatomical specimen
old man,you are a hard one
then eupeithes' son, antinous, said to them:
and spoke out, saying:
stretching out their arms in my direction,
and speaking morally, something like cowardice and falsehood?
my friends, leaders and rulers of the argives,since gods have granted that this man be killed,who's done much damage, more than all the rest, let's test these trojan by attacking themwith armed excursions round their city,to see what they intend—whether they will leavetheir lofty city now that hector's dead, or stay there, still keen to fight without him
when the noble lady reached the suitors, she stood beside a pillar holding up the well-made roof,
it smashed through his white teeth
my husband—you have lost your life so young,leaving me a widow in our home,with our son still an infant, the childborn to you and me in our wretchedness
those companions you just mentioned have been killed
and wiping the encrusted brine out of his hair
i formed a plan to move up close beside him,
they have understood, and it now disgusts them to act, for their actions can change nothing in the eternal nature of things
we moved across the island quite amazed
when hector did not meet his fair wife in the house,  he went and, standing in the doorway, asked his servant:
i have seen other menwho trusted their strong power and courageand with their numbers held their countryagainst zeus' will
have spun the threads of this
you can assess the plant
may you never meet her when she swallows!
when melanthius the goatherd was coming out
aeneas, counselor to bronze-armed trojans,from all i see, i think that man must bethe warlike son of tydeus
but i shall list the leaders, commanders of the ships, and all the ships in full
once i would plugged my comrades' ears with wax,
who has zeus as witness?
now at last, upon returning to the primitive source of its being, it may venture to stride along boldly and freely before the eyes of all nations without being attached to the lead strings of a romanic civilization; if only it can learn constantly from one people--the greeks, from whom to be able to learn at all itself is a high honor and a rare distinction
are not you content to share a feast with us,
achilles pulled out his sharp sword and struck, hitting him on the collar bone, beside his neck
her name is arete, born of the same line
we can understand why so feeble a culture hates true art; it fears destruction from its hands
the image which now reveals his unity with the heart of the world is a dream scene, which symbolizes that original contradiction and pain, together with the primordial joy in illusion
the spear struck him as he was strutting forward
at last diomedes, skilled at war shouts, cried out:
i do not thinkyou will long escape complete destruction at my hands
for their violent ways
and if the german should hesitantly look around for a leader who might bring him back again into his long lost home whose ways and paths he scarcely knows anymore, let him merely listen to the ecstatically luring call of the dionysian bird that hovers above him and wants to point the way for him
yes, indeed, dear wife, everything you have said
salutes the herdsman moving his beasts out
but when that great voice issued from his chest, with words like winter snowflakes, no man alivecould match odysseus
the arrow had been loosed by alexander,
who recognized him, in spite of his disguise
in peace, and do not compete with younger men
i am the son of apheidas, lord polypemon's son
on their heads the girls had lovely flower garlands
aeacus came from zeus himself, and zeusis stronger than rivers flowing to the sea, so zeus' line is stronger than all thosedescended from a river
when calypso, that lovely goddess, tried
but finally he reached the surface, spitting tart salt water from his mouth, as it streamed down from off his head
oh my child, why did i rear you,
but you are much too proud,
never would come back
but if she keeps on doing this for long,
those are the facts, and i do like to speak the truth
so long-suffering lord odysseus lay down there,
i do not blame you, but agamemnon
but come now, so we may rouse another man,someone who should be there when we discussour plans, whether we should flee or battle on
let's have no more crying
i must keep going
or were you fighting to seize their city and their women?
three times trojans and their allies were thrown into confusion
that's what he said
to strike at me unfairly, and by force
those weapons were the cause earth swallowed up
some were wiping tables down with porous sponges and setting them in place, while others passed around huge amounts of meat
when morning comes, we will go on board, set off on the wide sea
or i will seize himand pitch him into black tartarus, way down,into the deepest pit below the earth,where the gates are iron, the threshold bronze,as far below hades as heaven lies above the earth
waving two sharp spears, he roamed through all the army,rousing men to fight, steeling hearts for dreadful war
was true, when she claimed that out at sea,
it is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists of the time combated the old ecclesiastical conception of man as inherently corrupt and lost, with this newly created picture of the paradisiacal artist: so that opera is to be understood as the opposition dogma of the good man, but may also, at the same time, provide a consolation for that pessimism which, owing to the frightful uncertainty of all conditions of life, attracted precisely the serious-minded men of the time
while this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable aeternae veritates [eternal verities
his life was cut short on great ajax's deadly spear
and please your honoured mother and father
i can boast that i am no worse than her
may that never be
but you can hear a man's distress from anywhere
that life really so tragic would least of all explain the origin of an art form--assuming that art is not merely imitation of the reality of nature but rather a metaphysical supplement of the reality of nature, placed beside it for its overcoming
three and four times blessed, who died back then in spacious troy, while doing a favour
other than the two of us, you and me,
once odysseus had clearly seen how firm their minds were, he spoke to them again, saying these words:
one of the phaeacian elders there among them:
we have shared this food, and music has accompanied
wife, i will not disregard what you advise
warm up some water, so he can bathe,
the father of gods and men agreed
by now light was shining on the ground,
once the wine had addled cyclops' wits,
quickly they brought in a male ox, five years old, flayed it, and prepared the beast, slicing up the limbs
tragedy grew up out of this foundation and, for that very reason, has, from its inception, been spared the embarrasing business of counterfeiting reality
where are his horses?
now it's time to get a dinner ready
the battle shouts fill heaven
it was his apollonian insight that, like a barbarian king, he did not understand a divine image and was in danger of sinning against a divinity through his failure to understand
his sons were sitting with their father inside the courtyard, wetting garments with their tears
with loyal servants keeping watch on them
led him to a fatal destiny, the day he met
out of the violet sea, and moved on shore,
the slaughtered sheep, the wine and bread consumed
nausicaa, whose beauty was a gift from god,
for warmth and light
i hope angerlike this rage you are nursing never seizes me
odysseus will not stay away much longer
once the funeral gathering broke up, the men dispersed, each one going to his own ship, concerned to eat and then enjoy sweet sleep
when they would drunk down
lead out great priam to administer the oathin person, for his sons are over-proud, untrustworthy
though it's essential we move really fast
the first to begin the rout was peneleus, a boeotian
with this chorus, the profound greek, capable of the most delicate and the most severe suffering, consoled himself, the man who looked around with a daring gaze in the middle of the terrifying destructive instincts of so-called world history and equally into the cruelty of nature and who is in danger of longing for the denial of the will of buddhism
whipping you in shame from our assembly
these proud suitors telemachus and i
hear me, child of aegis-bearing zeus,
gleaming wine, and cattle for sacrifice,
to be sad all the time and never stop,
called the swineherd to him and, taking a whole loaf from the fine basket and as much meat as he could hold in both his hands, he spoke to him, saying:
i have managed hereto ease somewhat my heart's grief for the deathof menoetius' son, though the man i have killedis a lesser man than he
then his noble heart gave out a mighty groan,
men from aspledon and minyan orchomenus were led by ascalaphus and ialmenus, ares' sons
at cassandra's shout, no man or woman was left unaffected
no man stops zeus' plans,
purged the house and yard completely
by phaeacian noblemen enjoying his song,
in ithaca, and gave him countless gifts—
like a child—you are now too old for that
would not be sweet
attempting to get home, we had to take
i chopped off a piece, six feet in length,
we sat there eating rich supplies of meat
and kindness, as a father for a son
began to blow, and so our ships moved fast
we went inside the cave and looked around
sought her hand in marriage
his wife and noble son
and there i offered a full sacrifice
and prepare a place to sleep—a bed, cloaks,
i have come now from our shipshere to the plain
fleeing from argos because he would killed a man
so you are putting onthe immortal armour of the finest man,who makes other men afraid
i wish it were as certain that i wasthe son of aegis-bearing zeus himself,
he quickly spoke winged words to telemachus,
arrived from their fine ship
i have twenty geese come from the water
created out of merely premature and really immature personal experiences, which lay close to the threshold of something communicable, and built on the basis of art (for the problem of scientific research cannot be understood on the basis of scientific enquiry)—a book perhaps for artists with analytical tendencies and a capacity for retrospection (that means for exceptions, a type of artist whom it is necessary to seek out and whom one never wants to look for), full of psychological innovations and artists' secrets, with an artist's metaphysics in the background, a youthful work full of the spirit of youth and the melancholy of youth, independent, defiantly self-sufficient as well, even where it seemed to bow down with special reverence to an authority—in short, a first work also in the bad sense of the word, afflicted, in spite of the antiquity of the problem, with every fault of youth, above all with its excessive verbiage and its storm and stress
daughter of aegis-bearing zeus, in shape and form looking just like mentor, had both parties swear a solemn treaty designed to last forever
although some dear companions had been killed
the walls and beautiful pedestals,
but as the seasons came and went, the year arrived
through these gates the goddesses led out their horses, hera lashing them ahead
the cicones, and then came to the fertile land
tell me about the number of the suitors,
had quickly called achaeans to assembly,
she found him working with his bellows, moving round,
after that, peleus' son quickly set out other prizesfor the footrace—a finely crafted silver mixing bowl, holding six measures
now, at that moment, feelings between zeus and other immortal gods could have become much harsher, more incensed, if athena, fearing what might happen to the gods, had not jumped from the throne where she would been sitting, rushed out the door, seized ares' helmet from his head,  grabbed the shield from off his shoulders and the spear out of his mighty fist, and thrown them to one side
and let old nestor know what's happening
mother, you are a cruel woman, with an unfeeling heart
innards, flesh, and marrow—leaving nothing
divine charybdis terrified us all,
for a long time he stood in shock, speechless
the dialects they speak
to my own hut and entertaining you!
in fact, if anyoneever spoke rudely to me in the house—one of your brothers or sisters, some brother's well-dressed wife, or your mother—for your fatheralways was so kind, as if he were my own—you would speak out, persuading them to stop,using your gentleness, your soothing words
did you not tell us
with bread and meat and wine
if you gorged yourselves, then someday soon
having said this, queen hera went inside the house, sat on her throne
that's what hermes said, but his fine words did not persuade aegisthus in his heart
then he sprinkled over them
no one's heart went unsatisfied
then he created two splendid cities of mortal men
he may hear of it somewhere—and to gain
on his right shoulder he waved his dreadful spear made of pelian ash
then climbed out through the surf
and agree with what i am going to tell you—
that's what i asked, and he gave me his answer right away:
and eased disturbing worries he had in his heart
for gods and all achaeans understand
of those companions of the son of atreus
the best one for you, and then, when that ship
but come,let's enjoy our love together on the bed
but then the din of war raged round the sturdy wall
they boarded quickly and sat down at their benches
is telling her to ask about her husband
no island sloping down into the sea
this said, the two men pulled on fearful armour
any of his comrades who defend him
constantly disturbing them in their roadside nests— those fools make mischief for all sorts of people
attendants passed these hairsamong the leaders of the trojans and achaeans
the marriage or invent some other scheme
hector did not stay in the well-armed trojan group, but, like an eagle swooping down upon some flock of winged birds feeding by a river bank— wild geese or cranes or long-necked swans—he rushed straight at the dark-prowed ships to take on ajax
acroneus, ocyalus, and elatreus,
those two spectators he honoured as the only judges capable of rendering a verdict and as the masters of all his art
patroclus did the same, standing up as soon as he saw the embassy
once penelope said this, the old woman went through the chamber to instruct the women and urge them to appear
athena went down into the trojan crowd, looking like laodocus, antenor's son, a strong spearman, seeking godlike pandarus
he stood up quickly, looked at trojans and achaeans,saw trojans running off with argives driving themfrom the back, among them god poseidon
some newsfrom phthia that only you have heard?
but to be trapped here,all alone, that could be worse
and can you nownot face menelaus?
poseidon watched odysseus sailing on the sea,
so they could all offer sacrifices
when she would told me this, i replied and said:
let zeus judge between trojans and achaeans, as his heart desires
who loves lightning, for he accompanies
find their delight in different kinds of work
again and again we experience how a beethoven symphony makes it necessary for the individual listener to talk in images, even if it's true that the collection of different worlds of imagery created by a musical piece really looks fantastically confused, even contradictory
where i have twelve mares and sturdy mules
as he came out
that he is dead and gone, then come back here,
my honoured mother answered me at once:
could have a contest working in the spring,
looking round now, i ca not see them here,any of them
my heart fears that man, but i respect himtoo much to rob him, in case something bad comes to me later
then you would quickly learn
though i suspected something, i had to go
first to rise, well before the rest, was agamemnon, king of men
and then, when you have offered prayers of supplication to celebrated nations of the dead,
you sons of priam, that god-nurtured king,why are you still allowing the achaeans to keep slaughtering your troops?
hence, in the song and the lyrical mood, willing (our personal interest in our own purposes) and pure contemplation in the setting which presents itself are miraculously mixed up together
land rich in grass and wheat
but he has perished
past this island and not listened to us,
but some, i think, will not obey him
the point did not pass through, but its momentum knocked sarpedon back in the middle of his charge
where are you rushing off?
seeing him do that,they leapt quickly from their chariots and left them there
just as the mind races in a man who's voyaged to many lands,when in his fertile head he recalls everything, and thinks i wish i were here!
horse-taming trojans and bronze-clad achaeans,men who earlier were fighting one anotherin wretched war out there on the plain, both keen for war's destruction, are sitting still
back to his lair and brings to both of them
but we rushed on
the fish have eaten him down in the sea,
you speakin triumph about widowing his wifein her new bridal home, bringing sorrow, grief beyond enduring, to his parents
how i sail across the fish-filled seas
sufficient trouble—you here lamenting
that's how the loyal swineherd hugged telemachus
skilled in many magic potions, i met hermes of the golden wand
he, one solitary individual, stepped forward with an expression of contempt and superiority, as the pioneer of a brand new style of culture, art, and morality, into that world, a scrap of which we would count it an honour to catch
immortal night would end before i finished
he was pasturing his rich flocks in the fields
so he can quickly tell that fair-haired nymph
i will take care of this, make sure it comes to pass
phaeacians, how does this man seem to you for beauty, stature, and within himself,
king agamemnon stood up, hands gripping his staff, one fashioned by hephaestus' careful craftsmanship
when all of us, astonished, questioned him, he spoke out,
hephaestus is not home
until the cries of warfare reached my ships
hector, aeneas, and godlike chromius, afraid of both ajaxes, moved back once again, leaving aretus lying there with a mortal wound
the way you men behave
odysseus was alert enough to drop his staff
who hears and watches over everything
the two lapiths now began to kill in earnest
they straightened it, while i,
underneath he spread an untanned hide and on top
a double fold across her shoulders, and sandals
which i have reached, all these things will happen
went to the dark-water spring
does not happen to them later
in the home of the son of atreus,
for these cows and lovely sheep belong to helios,
for no matter what he says, she undermines it
when the fighting spirit in xanthus had been broken,the two gods fought no longer
then diomedes grabbed a spear and went away
meanwhile four women serving in her home
when this task was over,
he sliced up small pieces, then got them ready on the spits
they strike at me and hatch their wicked plans
seven talents of finely crafted gold,
and we found warrior menoetius and yourself, together with achilles
the sound of reconciliation from another world echoes most purely perhaps in oedipus at colonus
were more attracted to a nasty scheme
about your noble father
is always harder than a stone
where does he come from?
away from there and sailed in here at night
then my provisions would have all been spent,
feed your swift-footed horses properly
no god,hephaestus,can stand against you
but, yielding to my strength and power,
through her tears, she spoke to him—her words had wings:
but once i would reached my ships beside the sea
half-way between tenedos and rocky imbros, a wide cavern sits deep within the sea
greek art and pre-eminently greek tragedy delayed above all the destruction of myth
what is left now for music is music of stimulation or memory, that is, either music as a means of stimulating jaded and worn out nerves or sound painting
spoke out, and we came in and caught her
our guest, when he gets back, can tell his friends just how much we surpass all other men
she would come down there
and i agree with them
they were amazed to see these birds with their own eyes
he moved through those fighting in the front, like a swift hawk swooping down on daws or starlings
daughter of zeus,leave war and fights alone
one of them may hear
but telemachus ignored what he would just said
eurymachus—he gives more courting gifts
and give him a sharp spear, as a defense
they will both soon lose the urge to stay in bed
then housekeeper eurynome said to her:
out of this house against her will the one
which you may have seen with your own eyes
hector understood her words
why talk that way?
if i would had the foresight to anticipatewhat zeus is doing now when eurystheussent hercules down to the house of hades,the gate keeper, to fetch back from erebushades' dreadful hound, he would never have escapedthe deep rushing waters of the river styx
by that corpse ajax took many of their lives
in earlier days, all mortal men would claimthat priam's city was rich in gold and bronze
menelaus, son of atreus,
you must run quickly to achaean shipsto tell achilles, so he can bring the corpsein safety to his ship—the naked body,for now hector of the gleaming helmetwears his armour
let that bird appear over to your right,so, once you witness it with your own eyes,you can have faith, as you go to the shipsof those fast-riding argives
mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing zeus,planted elm trees all around his body
then one of her women
all other choral lyrics of the greeks are only an immense intensification of the apollonian solo singer; whereas in the dithyramb a congregation of unconscious actors stands before us, who look upon each other as transformed
she came out, bringing with her a basin and a water jug
there the attendants quickly set about their work
for agamemnon, to make sure his fame
was such a great one, and he killed so many
and have returned from pylos
wise penelope heard his words and rebuked melantho, saying to her:
because on trojan soil you were the king
among them, peleus' son began the urgent lamentations, placing his murderous hands on the chest of his companion,
what if i go out to stand against himbefore the city?
in his stubbornness, he refused to do that, swearing this oath:
if i, acting all alone, was overwhelmed
at these grinding stones twelve women used to work, making barley meal and flour, which feed men's marrow
noemon, son of phronius, then answered antinous:
they saw hector, skilled at war cries, his companions, all the soldiers standing idle in the rear,  all those warriors battling on by their swift ships
they found him inside his house, at a marriage feast he was providing for his many relatives,
but my heart prompts me nowto stand against you face to face once more,whether i kill you, or you kill me
with my people prospering around me
the bonze point drove on through
with a bright veil on her face
when they all came inside the son of atreus' hut, agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed an ox,a male five years old, to the exalted son of cronos
now, let's talk of something else
a much larger stone, swung it round, and threw it, using all his unimaginable force
since you owe your life to me
for agamemnon had dishonoured the god's priest, chryses, who would come to the ships to find his daughter, chryseis, bringing with him a huge ransom
with a boar to be butchered for the suitors,
the man who triumphs will call you his dear wife
groups of men are quick to grow enraged
are you suffering now?
or shall i tell the truth?
the river's stream flowed once more in its channel
but she left behind
supporting irus will use his heavy fists
instead his fate decrees
that mare i was awardedi freely give you
perhaps a goddess, or maybe a woman—
i must be frank
if you string the bow, you will face great trouble
i will take him someday on a trim black ship
back to his father's house
well, see how nicely this filthy beggar talks,
but hera,unable to contain her anger, burst out:
with that, dream flew off, sweet sleep released me
or have you come with news?
that's what i said, and their proud hearts agreed
and about a feast
what you have said
at that moment, achilles, slapping his thighs, said to patroclus:
now suddenly a tidal wave of the dionysian takes the single small individual crests on its back, just as the brother of prometheus, the titan atlas, shouldered the earth
a mighty oath i would not tell you,
returning from the ethiopians, saw him
a youthful palm-tree shoot growing up
who would find it easy to shift that bed
helen, child of zeus, who bears the aegis, sat down
while we are moving through the countryside
son of lord aretias, spoke to them and said:
they gathered piles of wood and made perfect sacrificial offerings to the gods
all the crew fell overboard and floated on the waves, like cormorants,
when he came to the wealthy land of ithaca,
as for the flocks those arrogant suitors stole,
the men must know our claim: we are sworn friends from our fathers' days till now!
no way to escape it now
helen the child of zeus replied, that's laertes' son, the great tactician odysseus
that was the time he shipped him to lemnos fortress, sold him off and the son of jason paid the price for the slave, but a stranger there released him from his chains, eetion out of imbros paid a princely ransom and sent him off to arisbe's shining walls
no messenger brought the truth of how her husband made his stand outside the gates
and what were the fighters thinking?
you raw recruit, green at the skills of battle!
i know him too well — he will never win me over!
that's what saved them, that alone, they and their ships along the churning surf
i yearned, in a boy’s way, to approach the king and take him by the hand
as he tries to lift an enormous rock, pallas rifles a spear that strikes his spine midway where it parts the ribs, and wrenches back the shaft that’s wedged in the bone as hisbo pounces down on him, filled with the hope to take his man off guard
no change of heart, not even a little?
but aeneas’ force is locked fast in its own ramparts now, no hope of a breakout
she nurses a lifelong love of chastity and the hunt while she remains untouched
what, are you apollo’s sister?
he vowed to me long ago, he bowed his head that i should never embark for home till i had brought the walls of ilium crashing down
throned in their midst, greatest in years and first in power, sits latinus, the king’s brow hardly marked by joy
latinus replied in a calming, peaceful way: brave of the brave, my boy, the more you excel in feats of daring, the more it falls to me to weigh the perils, with all my fears, the lethal risks we run
now turnus glories in that spoil, exults to make it his
but would to god i would hit you deep in the guts and ripped your life away!
like zeus's bolts when the lord of bright-haired hera flashes lightning, threatening to loose torrential rain or pelting hail or snow when a blizzard drifts on fields — or driving on, somewhere on earth, the giant jaws of rending war — so thick-and-fast the groans came from atrides, wrenching his chest, heaving up from his heart and rocked his very spirit to the core
love me as you do, you ca not persuade me now
but ajax, shielding patroclus round with his broad buckler, stood fast now like a lion cornered round his young when hunters cross him, leading his cubs through woods — he ramps in all the pride of his power, bristling strength, the heavy folds of his forehead frowning down his eyes
capaneus' good son sthenelus saw them coming and quickly alerted diomedes, warnings flying: tydides, joy of my heart, dear comrade, look!
so he must have commanded — you maniac, you obeyed
but i, i will be there in person at your tents to take briseis in all her beauty, your own prize — so you can learn just how much greater i am than you and the next man up may shrink from matching words with me, from hoping to rival agamemnon strength for strength!
so he dispatched me, to teach you all these things, to make you a man of words and a man of action too
if my songs have any power, the day will never dawn that wipes you from the memory of the ages, not while the house of aeneas stands by the capitol’s rock unshaken, not while the roman father rules the world
aeneas said no more
then men who lived in methone and thaumacia, men who held meliboea and rugged ridged olizon: philoctetes the master archer had led them on in seven ships with fifty oarsmen aboard each, superbly skilled with the bow in lethal combat
but i with my courage, my hands, never conquered — for all their force not all the gods on olympus heights could ever turn me back
here nisus halts, looking back for his lost friend, no use— my poor euryalus!
exhausted, frenzied with building hunger, starved so long, his jaws parched for blood
soon as you ripen into manhood, reaching back for the models of your kin, remember— father aeneas and uncle hector fire your heart!
come, this handsome cup: accept it from me, i beg you!
rising in anger, zeus who drives the storm clouds thundered, insatiable hera!
you’ve earned your rest at last
you all stand forewarned!
digging a heel in his chest menelaus stripped his gear and vaunted out in glory, so home you will run from our racing ships, by god, all as corpses — see, you death-defying trojans?
he never commanded you to settle here on crete
king latinus has them summoned into the palace and takes his fathers’ throne amidst them all
the fighters loosed their sweating teams from the yokes, tethered them by the reins, each at his own chariot
still you could bring them round with gifts and winning words
he clutched a thrusting-lance eleven forearms long; the bronze tip of the weapon shone before him, ringed with a golden hoop to grip the shaft
he lunged in with a spear at thestor's son alcmaon, stabbed him, dragged out the shaft as the victim, caving into the spear's pull, pitched headfirst and his fine bronze armor clashed against his corpse
so you are no offspring of tydeus, the gallant, battle-hardened oeneus' son!
these, these were the captains of achaea and the kings
what a cortege you’ll see, old tiber, flowing past the massive tomb just built!
then, their weeping over, they lay his corpse on a litter, swathe him round in purple robes that form the well-known shroud
the true name of the old river albula’s lost and gone
he made his way through achaea's ships and shelters, flaring his great crimson cape with a strong hand and stopped at odysseus' huge black-bellied hull, moored mid-line so a shout could reach both wings, upshore to telamonian ajax' camp or down to achilles' — trusting so to their arms' power and battle-strength they would hauled their trim ships up on either flank
meriones gave odysseus bow, quiver and sword and over his head he set a helmet made of leather
first agamemnon lord of men spilled the giant odius, chief of the halizonians off his car — the first to fall, as he veered away the spearhead punched his back between the shoulders, gouging his flesh and jutting out through his ribs — he fell with a crash, his armor rang against him
but if they are bent on seizing other countries, other people now, and it’s in their power to put our land astern, then we’ll build them twenty ships of italian oak
just step this way!
and our bravest man is dead, sarpedon, zeus's son — did zeus stand by him?
never without you, when i am bent on glory, whether in word or action, peace or war, you have my trust forever
so rose the relentless din of horse and fighting men breaking against them now as they struggled back to shore
no more running away
but you wo not lift a hand to fight beside them
then back over her brow she draped her headdress, fine fresh veils for hera the queen of gods, their pale, glimmering sheen like a rising sun, and under her smooth feet she fastened supple sandals
all hot pursuit, aeneas brandishes high his spear, that tree of a spear, and shouts from a savage heart: more delay!
or have the trojans sworn to carve you a fine estate?
but there you sit, hurling abuse at the son of atreus, agamemnon, marshal of armies, simply because our fighters give atrides the lion's share of all our plunder
with that, he binds his own brows with his mother’s myrtle
— queen hera wondered, her eyes glowing wide
the son of atreus, that skilled breaker of horses?
now tell me, muse, who were the bravest of them all, of the men and chariot-teams that came with atreus' sons?
resounding applause, cries of partisans fill the woods and the curving bayshore rolls the sound around and the pelted hillsides volley back the roar
but once at the front, hold off from the spear-play, out of range ourselves since who of us wants to double wounds on wounds?
to me your mother bore you
but here i fear the worst, i dread a breakthrough
three thracians too, of the northwind’s lofty stock, and three whom their father, idas, and fatherland ismarus sent away to the wars, but clausus kills them all with a novel twist of death for each
look at this prize!
go home with your ships and comrades, lord it over your myrmidons!
if only i’d gone down under your right hand—diomedes, strongest greek afield— and poured out my life on the battlegrounds of troy!
that's his hope, his prayer, thanks to achilles, ironbound by the ships and filled with anger still
give us this chance to make our way to aeneas, pallanteum too, and you’ll soon see us back, loaded with spoils, some bloody killing done
four altars to neptune
we will hand you agamemnon's loveliest daughter, lead her here from argos, marry her off to you if you will just help us raze the walls of troy
beachhead in latium, armies gather in death, caieta, aeneas’ nurse, you too have granted our shores a fame that never dies
and troy up in flames?
and do not go flying off on your own across the halls, a bird of evil omen — you ca not dissuade me now
the rest of the gods had feasted full on oxen, true, but the huntress alone, almighty zeus's daughter — oeneus gave her nothing
yours was the first bread i broke, demeter's gift, that day you seized me in priam's well-fenced orchard, hauled me away from father, loved ones, sold me off in holy lemnos and i, i fetched you a hundred bulls — and once released i brought three times that price
but if this image of devotion cannot move you, here, this bough—showing the bough enfolded in her robes— you know it well
there is the story of italy, rome in all her triumphs
that breathed enormous strength in the good captain — right through the front he went, helmed in flashing bronze
at once he went for automedon with that spear — quick as a god, the aide of swift achilles — keen to cut him down but his veering horses swept him well away — magnificent racing stallions, gifts of the gods to peleus, shining immortal gifts
but you’re not slow when it comes to nightly bouts of love, when the curved flute strikes up some frantic bacchic dance!
— and they vowed a princely gift
far in front, palinurus leads the tight formation, a line commanded to set their course by him
taking their lead, the ladies fill the shrine with the smoke of incense, pouring out their wails from the steep threshold: you, power of armies, queen of the battle, pallas, virgin goddess, shatter that phrygian pirate’s spear!
teuthras first, orestes lasher of stallions next, an aetolian spearman trechus, oenomaus and helenus, oenops' son, and oresbius cinched with shining belt who had lived in hyle hoarding his great wealth, his estate aslope the shores of lake cephisus, and round him boeotians held the fertile plain
all looked up, overjoyed — the people's spirits lifted
and with that he flung a javelin at his enemy, planting one shaft after another, racing round in a sweeping ring but the golden boss of aeneas’ shield stands fast
he thought he would take the city of priam then, that very day, the fool
and it’s no new love, you know, that stirs diana, no sweet lightning bolt of passion
i tell you this, and it would have come to pass: once my lightning had blasted you in your chariot, you could never have returned to mount olympus where the immortals make their home
and camilla too, our ally sprung from volscian stock, heading her horsemen, squadrons gleaming bronze
all but my prize of honor
she swore as he urged and sounded out the names of all the gods in the tartarean pit we call the titans
they cried with one voice
there he stood, tensing, braced to take them on — his huge pike kept beating the trojans off the hulls, any attacker flinging tireless fire, and all the time that terrible voice of his, bellowing out to cohorts, friends!
and the more they fight, the hotter their battle fury grows and now the trojans mass, regrouping to storm the site, clashing man to man, daring to foray farther out
i feel the wrong i do to one so dear, robbing him of his kingdom, lands in the west, his fields decreed by fate
and their backbones creaked as scuffling hands tugged for submission-holds and sweat streamed down their spines and clusters of raw welts broke out on ribs and shoulders slippery, red with blood, and still they grappled, harder, locking for victory, locked for that burnished tripod: odysseus no more able to trip and bring to ground his man than ajax could — odysseus' brawn held out
and ares led them in with the deadly queen enyo bringing uproar on, the savage chaos of battle — the god of combat wielding his giant shaft in hand, now ranging ahead of hector, now behind him
hector in glory cutting patroclus down with hacking bronze then tearing the handsome war-gear off his back?
three aides at his side the trojan killed—off guard, sprawled in a snarl of arms, then remus’ armor-bearer, then his charioteer, he caught him under his horses’ hoofs
quickly they swerve their prows and row for town
once they reached the warships moored at the hellespont the contingents scattered, each man to his own ship, but achilles still would not dismiss his myrmidons, he gave his battle-loving comrades strict commands: charioteers in fast formation — friends to the death!
noemon led her off while atrides took instead the polished cauldron bright in all its sheen
struggling shoulder-to-shoulder, triton and cymothoë hoist and heave the ships from the jagged rocks as the god himself whisks them up with his trident, clearing a channel through the deadly reefs, his chariot skimming over the cresting waves on spinning wheels to set the seas to rest
he will even honor you on a par with his orestes, full-grown by now, reared in the lap of luxury
he knew the goddess' voice — he went on the run, flinging off his cape as eurybates picked it up, the herald of ithaca always at his side
and the great rout you see is helpless, still not buried
how wretched we are, she cries, that no greek soldier dragged us off to die in the war beneath our country’s walls
all face the sea at the far edge of sandy pylos and the men who live within them, rich in sheep-flocks, rich in shambling cattle, will honor you like a god with hoards of gifts and beneath your scepter's sway live out your laws in sleek and shining peace
achaeans will never know where to find his bones, never collect them now — i will bury that man so deep in mud and rocks!
wild with striving, sergestus— wheeling his prow toward the rock, risking an inside track, the dangerous straits—crashes into the jutting reefs, unlucky man
myself, now that i’ve reached my peaceful haven, here at the harbor’s mouth i’m robbed of a happy death
where’s your fame that thrilled all sicily once?
officiating, aeneas produced two pairs of gauntlets matched in weight and bound both fighters’ hands with equal weapons
and last he picked up two tough spears, tipped in bronze, honed sharp, and the glare flashed off their brazen points and pierced the high skies — and awestruck at the sight athena and hera loosed a crack of thunder, exalting the great king of mycenae rich in gold
his trusty comrade achates keeps his pace and the same cares weigh down his plodding steps
permit us to haul our storm-racked ships ashore, trim new oars, hew timbers out of your woods, so that, if we are fated to sail for italy—king and crews restored— to italy, to latium we will sail with buoyant hearts
this she bears away, her features veiled in a heavy mist, this she distils in secret into the river water poured in burnished bowls, and fills them with healing power and sprinkles ambrosial juices bringing health, and redolent cure-all too
treat your guests like kings
lunging at paris, he grabbed his horsehair crest, swung him round, started to drag him into argive lines and now the braided chin-strap holding his helmet tight was gouging his soft throat — paris was choking, strangling
that's how far we outnumber them, i would say — achaeans to trojans — the men who hail from troy at least
hugging the shaft he writhed, gasping, shuddering like some wild bull in the hills that herdsmen shackle, trapping the beast with twisted ropes and he fights them all the way as the men drag him off — so he gasped with his wound
jove is just that brief, but golden venus is far from brief as she replies: oh father, everlasting king over men and all the world, what other force could we implore to save us now?
any decent man, a man with sense, loves his own, cares for his own as deeply as i, i loved that woman with all my heart, though i won her like a trophy with my spear
look at the souvenirs she left me!
worthless husks, the men you rule — if not, atrides, this outrage would have been your last
oh i had my share of troubles for you, achilles, did my share of labor
he gave you, mantua, walls and his mother’s name, mantua, rich in the rosters of her forebears
and at last she tears herself away, his enemy forever, fleeing back to the shadowed forests where sychaeus, her husband long ago, answers all her anguish, meets her love with love
pray god the news will never reach my ears!
i give way, my son
no more wavering now, now buoyant spirits seize aeneas’ heart
zeus let loose a terrific bolt and blazing white at the hoofs of diomedes' team it split the earth, a blinding smoking flash — molten sulphur exploding into the air, stallions shying, cringing against the car — and the shining reins flew free of nestor's grip
nevertheless — clearly victory goes to menelaus dear to ares
he stood there speechless a while, struck dumb
i will infiltrate their entire army, i will, all the way till i reach the ship of agamemnon!
the armies massing
once it had burned down and the flames died away, he scattered the coals and stretching the spitted meats across the embers, raised them onto supports and sprinkled clean pure salt
and achilles led them now in a throbbing chant of sorrow, laying his man-killing hands on his great friend's chest, convulsed with bursts of grief
an eerie numbness unnerved him head to toe with dread, his hackles bristled in horror, voice choked in his throat
and i, if i would lanced your guts with bronze — strong as you are and cocksure of your hands — you would give me glory now, you would give your life to the famous horseman death!
up to his side he dashed and flanked great ajax tight, let fly with a spear and the glinting spearpoint hit the son of phausias, apisaon captain of armies, square in the liver, up under the midriff — his knees went limp as eurypylus rushed in, starting to rip the armor off his shoulders
and then, once he has bowed down to an unjust peace, may he never enjoy his realm and the light he yearns for, never, let him die before his day, unburied on some desolate beach!
but if you dare help your brother at closer range, go and do so, it becomes you
far apart on the shield, what’s more, he forged the homes of hell, the high gates of death and the torments of the doomed, with you, catiline, dangling from a beetling crag, cringing before the furies’ open mouths
they crowd the thwarts, their arms tense at the oars, ears tense for the signal; hearts pounding, racing with nerves high-strung and a grasping lust for glory
i have my own fate too, counter to theirs, to stamp out these accursed people with my sword— they’ve stolen away my bride!
and here the dreaded ferryman guards the flood, grisly in his squalor—charon
stop confusing my fixed resolve with this, this weeping and wailing just to serve his pleasure, atreus' mighty son
coroebus could not bear the sight of it—mad with rage he flung himself at the greek lines and met his death
seven women he will give you, flawless, skilled in crafts, women of lesbos — the ones he chose, his privilege, that day you captured the lesbos citadel yourself: they outclassed the tribes of women in their beauty
at that, helenus first performs a sacrifice, slaughters many bulls
the fates have given mortals hearts that can endure
that's why the archer sends us pains and he will send us more and never drive this shameful destruction from the argives, not till we give back the girl with sparkling eyes to her loving father — no price, no ransom paid — and carry a sacred hundred bulls to chryse town
and as for our wives, each in her own hall must set big fires burning
not all of us here will die today without revenge
but aeneas, pressed by a crowd of friends and iulus grieving sorely— the fighter stood there bridling, fuming, hunched on his rugged spear, unmoved by all their tears
his daughter had married hector helmed in bronze
fearing this, the almighty father banished the winds to that black cavern, piled above them a mountain mass and imposed on all a king empowered, by binding pact, to rein them back on command or let them gallop free
i know of no troves of treasure, piled, lying idle, anywhere
so the blissful gods were rousing both opposing armies, clashing front to front but then, in their own ranks, their overpowering strife broke out in massive war
so i must do all i can to pay her back, the price for the life she saved
stop the attack, do not fight them at their ships!
our part is always to magnify your power
but, oh, how little they know, the omniscient seers
no more standing back, no fighting these argives at a distance — kill them hand-to-hand
but the rest of the long-haired achaeans will hold out, right here, until we have plundered troy
next mnestheus goes for gyas, the huge chimaera stripped of her helmsman, giving up the lead
he found polydamas, panthous' son, and prince agenor and reaching aeneas and hector helmed in bronze, shoulder-to-shoulder let his challenge fly: hector, you have wiped your allies from your mind!
but now meriones pulled back to his cohorts, stung with rage for two defeats at once: victory shattered, spearshaft smashed to bits
how can i go on living?
we must hurry now
piercing the tendons, ankle to heel behind both feet, he knotted straps of rawhide through them both, lashed them to his chariot, left the head to drag and mounting the car, hoisting the famous arms aboard, he whipped his team to a run and breakneck on they flew, holding nothing back
be gracious, guard your faithful
sped home on the winds to greece
too late for such defense, such help
off they went to the tents of agamemnon — a few sharp commands and the work was done
first we sight the gulf of tarentum, hercules’ town, if the tale is true, then looming over the waves ahead, lacinian juno’s temple, caulon’s fort on the rugged coast of scylaceum, wrecker of ships, then far across the seas, rising up from the swells, we can see mount etna, sicily, hear the tremendous groaning of waters, pounding rocks, the resounding roar of breakers crashing on the shore— reefs spring up, swirling sand in the sea-surge
you are his wife, with every right to probe him with your prayers
spurring them on and first to seize a deadly brand, she held it high in her right hand, shook it to flame and with all her power hurled the fire home
the old charioteer moved in and woke him roughly, dug a heel in his ribs, chiding him to his face, up with you, diomedes!
you are my son
if, with turnus dead, i am ready to take the trojans on as allies, why not stop the war while he is still alive?
even priam might pity our embattled troops
forced back from them, true, they braced for battle still and made a stand
the crime they committed once should be enough!
weaving a growing web, a dark red folding robe, working into the weft the endless bloody struggles stallion-breaking trojans and argives armed in bronze had suffered all for her at the god of battle's hands
already i have let fly at two of their best men, diomedes and menelaus — i have hit them both, and the blood gushed from both, direct hits, but i only roused their fury
rhipeus falls too, the most righteous man in troy, the most devoted to justice, true, but the gods had other plans
so now dismiss them from the pyre, have them prepare an evening meal
else for a good long while i would have felt the pain, writhing among the corpses there, or soldiered on, weak as a breathless ghost, beaten down by bronze
the latins, their eyes, their looks are trained on you
— you with the gall to go against my onslaught
and the quick oilean ajax heard him clearly, first on the run along the fighting front to meet him — idomeneus after him and idomeneus' good aide, meriones, a match for the butcher god of war
and the old king motioned a steward standing by to pour some clear pure water over his hands, and she came forward, bearing a jug and basin
breaking ranks they rushed ahead in their chariot, charging diomedes already dismounted, rearing up on foot
menacing so that tydeus' son pulled back, just a little, edging clear of the distant deadly archer's rage
and once you have roused our lines to the last man, we will hold out here and fight the argives down, hard-hit as we are — necessity drives us on
with that, he extends his right hand toward his friend ilioneus, greeting serestus with his left, and then the others, gallant gyas, gallant cloanthus
stunned by pictures of these disasters blurring through his mind, turnus stood there, staring, speechless, churning with mighty shame, with grief and madness all aswirl in that one fighting heart: with love spurred by rage and a sense of his own worth too
radiant gifts the gods presented peleus that day they drove you into a mortal's marriage bed
so he pleaded and hearing the old man's prayers, zeus who rules the world let loose a great crack of thunder, rending the skies
she and the boy and a servant finely gowned were standing watch on the tower, sobbing, grieving
let him get used to watching you in action, admire you as his model from his youth
aeneas the trojan captain checked him sharply: no talk of turning for home!
by now early dawn had risen up from the saffron bed of tithonus, scattering fresh light on the world
if only some other fighter had your years and you could march with the younger, fitter men!
the common people are split into warring factions
take up a long spear, shield on your shoulder, go for the trojans, urge your troops to battle
did i press him to leave his camp or cast his life to the winds?
from then on, we have solemnized this service and all our heirs have kept the day with joy
they’d come on the man by chance, a total stranger
we achaeans will pay you back, three, four times over, if zeus will grant us the gift, somehow, someday, to raze troy's massive ramparts to the ground
let idaeus add this too, a good sound proposal: see if they are willing to halt the brutal war until we can burn the bodies of our dead
no one at all to fear
or did your own itch for glory spur you on?
no more for them
i slipped through the door, up to the jutting roof where the doomed trojans were hurling futile spears
they lived off branches, berries and acorns, hunters’ rough-cut fare
the first among all, you would bear off shining, priceless gifts from him
so he triumphed and now he was bent on outrage, on shaming noble hector
apollo comes to your call
when he saw aeneas striding toward him over the fields, he reached out both his hands as his spirit lifted, tears ran down his cheeks, a cry broke from his lips: you’ve come at last?
zeus knows, no doubt, and every immortal too, which fighter is doomed to end all this in death
three times the cliffs roared out from between the hollow caves, three times we saw the spume exploding to spray the stars
when hector heard that challenge he rejoiced and right in the no man's land along his lines he strode, gripping his spear mid-haft, staving men to a standstill while agamemnon seated his argives geared for combat
i’ll lull him into a deep sleep and hide him far away on cythera’s heights or high idalium, my shrines, so he cannot learn of my trap or spring it open while it’s being set
let it remind you of the burial of patroclus
before his eyes the god of the lovely river, old tiber himself, seemed to rise from among the poplar leaves, gowned in his blue-grey linen fine as mist with a shady crown of reeds to wreathe his hair, and greeted aeneas to ease him of his anguish: born of the stock of gods, you who bring back troy to us from enemy hands and save her heights forever!
the guide and giant-killer refused him firmly, you test me again, old man, since i am young, but you will not persuade me, tempting me with a gift behind achilles' back
i seem to remember once before you fled my spear
there's powerful diomedes brought down by an archer, odysseus wounded, and agamemnon too, the famous spearman, and eurypylus took an arrow-shot in the thigh
they look up—the terrific peals come crashing over and over— and see blood-red in a brilliant sky, rifting a cloudbank, armor clashing out
i dedicate you, lausus, decked in the spoils i strip from that pirate’s corpse— my son, my living trophy over aeneas!
the skies have begun to rumble, peals of thunder first and the storm breaking next, a cloudburst pelting hail and the troops of hunters scatter up and down the plain, tyrian comrades, bands of dardans, venus’ grandson iulus panicking, running for cover, quick, and down the mountain gulleys erupt in torrents
what will your rutulians, all the rest of italy say if i betray you to death—may fortune forbid!— while you appeal for my daughter’s hand in marriage?
with my own eyes i saw him, clear, in broad daylight, moving through your gates
even if zeus the thundering lord of hera lets you seize your glory, you must not burn for war against these trojans, madmen lusting for battle — not without me — you will only make my glory that much less
diomedes killed the man and his aide-in-arms at once, axylus and calesius who always drove his team — both at a stroke he drove beneath the earth
but paris replied at once to helen's challenge: no more, dear one — do not rake me with your taunts, myself and all my courage
and with that he issues orders: trim your sails!
time and again i heard your claims in father's halls, boasting how you and you alone of all the immortals
rumor flies that idomeneus, famous cretan prince, has fled his father’s kingdom, an exile, and the shores of crete are now deserted, clear of enemies, homes derelict, standing ready for us to settle
now, again, your phoebus apollo pulls you through, the one you pray to, wading into our storm of spears
tell atrides to arm his long-haired achaeans, to attack at once, full force — now he can take the broad streets of troy
since fighting hector's flanked by god almighty
their cries rang out
the king of men agamemnon hailed him quickly: nestor, son of neleus, great pride of achaea, why turn your back on the lines where men are dying?
he picked off clitus, pisenor's shining son — the charioteer to noble panthous' son polydamas — wrestling the reins, struggling to head his horses straight for the point where most battalions panicked, eager to please prince hector and all his trojans, clitus raced on but his death came even faster
in the same breath he stretched his loving arms but could not seize him, no, the ghost slipped underground like a wisp of smoke
with that he put new strength in each man's spirit
all the warlords sounded their assent
which pact can he embrace?
come now, my olympian, swear your inviolate oath that he shall lord it over all who dwell around him — that child who drops between a woman's knees today, born of the stock of men who spring from zeus's blood
oh, my poor doomed people!
but now the son of tydeus came upon the king, the thirteenth man, and ripped away his life, his sweet life as he lay there breathing hard
from here i sailed
we broke our sworn truce
you, phoebus, herded his shambling crook-horned cattle along the spurs of ida's timbered ridges
they say you are peleus' son, that fine, flawless man; your mother, thetis, sleek-haired child of the sea
now as the king and queen provoked each other, glistening-footed thetis reached hephaestus' house, indestructible, bright as stars, shining among the gods, built of bronze by the crippled smith with his own hands
but i live on, not yet have i left the land of men and light of day but i will leave it all!
and so in the same breath i mourn for you and me, my doom-struck, harrowed heart!
yes, so the generation of dardanus will not perish, obliterated without an heir, without a trace: dardanus, dearest to zeus of all the sons that mortal women brought to birth for father
as mezentius spied him routing the lines far off, crested in purple plumes, the blue of his bride-to-be— like a famished lion stalking the cattle pens for prey, for the hunger will often drive him mad, just let him spot some goat on the run or a stag’s antlers branching high: his big jaws gape at the sport, his mane bristles, then a pouncing assault!
the great tactician odysseus gave him a dark glance and shot back at once, now what's this, atrides, this talk that slips through your clenched teeth?
and you used to plan their victory!
laodamia lay in the arms of zeus who rules the world and she bore the god a son, our great commander, sarpedon helmed in bronze
and now achilles set out a lump of pig iron, the shot eetion used to put with all his power before the swift runner pelides brought him down and hauled it off in the ships with all his other wealth
oh how wrong it is, this anger you keep smoldering in your heart!
his brains burst from the wound in sprays of blood, soaking the weapon's socket — his strength dissolved on the spot, his grip loosed and he dropped the foot of brave patroclus' corpse
and many reap the benefits of that treasure: troops of men he saves, as he himself knows best
what if it's fated for us to die beside this body — all dead in a mass?
nor do you lack the other brands of outrage, all that shame you heaped on me, you rabid dogs!
they lie when they say you are born of storming zeus
as soon as the wretched latin women hear the worst, the queen’s daughter lavinia is the first to tear her golden hair and score her lustrous cheeks, the rest of the women round her mad with grief and the long halls resound with trilling wails of sorrow
for awaiting the queen, beneath the great temple now, exploring its features one by one, amazed at it all, the city’s splendor, the work of rival workers’ hands and the vast scale of their labors—all at once he sees, spread out from first to last, the battles fought at troy, the fame of the trojan war now known throughout the world, atreus’ sons and priam—achilles, savage to both at once
why have swords or useless lances gripped in our fists?
and king agamemnon, thrilled to see his efforts, cheered him on with a flight of praise: old war-horse, if only your knees could match the spirit in your chest and your body's strength were planted firm as rock, but the great leveler, age, has worn you down
now, again, your phoebus apollo pulls you through, the one you pray to, wading into our storm of spears
are you that aeneas whom loving venus bore to dardan anchises on the simois’ banks at troy?
up with you — before all troy is torched to a cinder here and now!
in your hands alone the glory and power of king latinus rest, you alone can shore our sinking house
none of them knew it, each denied the mark
or you, serranus the sower, seeding your furrow?
the memories flooded over him, live tears flowing, and now he would lie on his side, now flat on his back, now facedown again
first pour out cups to father zeus and the other gods, then refresh yourself, if you would like to quench your thirst
and here is thetis now, in our own house!
she joined him now, and following in her steps a servant holding the boy against her breast, in the first flush of life, only a baby, hector's son, the darling of his eyes and radiant as a star
nestor stood there, stunned
and all my trojans join me, drinking deep of a trojan city’s welcome
here are the terms that i set forth — let zeus look down, my witness!
the great fighter sank to his knees, bracing himself with one strong forearm planted against the earth, and the world went black as night before his eyes
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind his heels with silver ankle-clasps, next he strapped the breastplate round his chest then over his shoulder achilles slung his sword, the fine bronze blade with its silver-studded hilt, then hoisted the massive shield flashing far and wide like a full round moon — and gleaming bright as the light that reaches sailors out at sea, the flare of a watchfire burning strong in a lonely sheepfold up some mountain slope when the gale-winds hurl the crew that fights against them far over the fish-swarming sea, far from loved ones — so the gleam from achilles' well-wrought blazoned shield shot up and hit the skies
our kingdom is new
i know of no other armor
castaways, we know nothing, not the people, not the place— lost, hurled here by the gales and heavy seas
hope no more the gods’ decrees can be brushed aside by prayer
the old king woke in terror, roused the herald
but their master polydamas marked the kill at once, ran and planted himself across the horses' path and handed them on to protiaon's son astynous, shouting strict commands — watch my every move!
nearby, two four-horse chariots, driven to left and right, had torn mettus apart—man of alba, you should have kept your word— and tullus hauled the liar’s viscera through the brush as blood-drops dripped like dew from brakes of thorns
and on it flies, faster than spear or wind-swift shaft while the rest race on in her wake
lift up your prows, thrust them on, beaks plowing this enemy coast, keels cutting their own furrows!
all eyes are fixed on him—his blood is up and nothing can quench the fighter’s ardor now
the sword decides all once turnus sees his ranks of latins broken in battle, their spirits dashed and the war-god turned against them, now is the time, he knows, for him to keep his pledge
on it they always fixed their gifts to the local god and they hung their votive clothes in thanks for rescue
next diomedes lord of the war cry prayed aloud, hear me too, daughter of zeus, tireless goddess!
the rushing tiber still steams with our blood, the endless fields still glisten with our bones
lord marshal agamemnon rose up in their midst, streaming tears like a dark spring running down some desolate rock face, its shaded currents flowing
but night came on too soon
instantly there he stands, that immense man, dares, jaw thrust out, tremendous in all his power
they make a menace for every man in sight
acamas and the old hero pirous led the thracians, all the hellespont bounds within her riptide straits
listen to me, quickly!
so staunch they stood the trojan onslaught, never shrinking once as atrides ranged the ranks, shouting out commands: now be men, my friends!
so the outcome proved when the awestruck prophets sang the signs to later ages
the third can leave content with this greek helmet
everywhere — rocks, ramparts, breastworks swam with the blood of trojans, argives, both sides, but still the trojans could not rout the argives
have it your way
for all your power, soldier, crushed at my hands you will breach the gates of death!
mothers stand on the ramparts, trembling, eyes trailing the cloud of dust and the troops in gleaming bronze
holding it dear she tended it—marvelous devotion— draping the snow-white fleece and festal boughs
that sight was bruited about as a sign of wonder, terror: for lavinia, prophets sang of a brilliant fame to come, for the people they foretold a long, grueling war
book fourteen: hera outflanks zeus
poor fool — as if apollo would lift a hand to save him now from death, grim death
they hover at jove’s throne, crouch at his gates to serve that savage king and whet the fears of afflicted men whenever the king of gods lets loose horrific deaths and plagues or panics towns that deserve the scourge of war
here, flocking the altar, hecuba and her daughters huddled, blown headlong down like doves by a black storm— clutching, all for nothing, the figures of their gods
he screamed in flames, his clear currents bubbling up like a cauldron whipped by crackling fire as it melts down the lard of a fat swine, splattering up around the rim — dry logs blazing under it, lashing it to the boil — so the river burned, his clear currents seethed and lost all will to flow
saturn’s second child— such tides of rage go churning through your heart
he begged the whole achaean army but most of all the two supreme commanders, atreus' two sons, agamemnon, menelaus — all argives geared for war!
certain it is, i warn you, we wo not break off from battle and leave the field with no more than a youngster's banter light as this
but nisus storms the thick of them, out for volcens, one among all, volcens his lone concern
sighs heaved from his depths as achilles burst forth, ah god, time and again, my doomed, my dearest friend, you would set before us a seasoned meal yourself, here in our tents, in your quick and expert way, when argive forces rushed to fight the trojans, stampeding those breakers of horses into rout
so jove declares, and turns his glance away from the latian fields below
if father hyrtacus ever gave you gifts in my name to grace your altars, if i have ever adorned them with hunting trophies, hanging them from your dome, fixing them to your roofs— help me rout my enemies!
then achilles called the serving-women out: bathe and anoint the body — bear it aside first
but they had no lust for the grind of battle now — where was the man who marched their lines to war?
low as the first stir of stormwind caught in the trees when the rustling unseen murmur keeps on rolling, warning sailors that gales are coming on
you are the ones i chose, my troops at troy’s last stand
to see if zeus will stretch his hands above your heads and save your craven lives?
don’t just stand there!— iapyx cries, the first to inflame their hearts against the foe
but all lies in the lap of the great gods
i will lie in peace, once i have gone down to death
smoldering at the father, seized with wild resentment
now, once they’d paraded past the assembled crowd, triumphant on horseback, bright in the eyes of kinsmen, all riders took their places and epytides from afar called out get set— a crack of his whip, and watch, the long column, split into three equal squads, splits into rows of six, in bands dancing away, then recalled at the next command they wheeled and charged each other, lances tense for attack, wheeling charge into countercharge, return and turn through the whole arena, enemies circling, swerving back in their armor, acting out a mock display of war, now baring their backs in flight, now turning spears for attack, now making peace and riding file by file
but asius captain of armies, hyrtacus' son refused to leave his horses there with a driver reining back — and on he drove at the fast trim ships, chariot and all, the fool
i bring you a message sent by zeus: he says the gods are angry with you now and he is rising over them all in deathless wrath that you in heartsick fury still hold hector's body, here by your beaked ships, and will not give him back
whenever odysseus met some man of rank, a king, he would halt and hold him back with winning words: my friend — it's wrong to threaten you like a coward, but you stand fast, you keep your men in check!
blind to your own realm, oblivious to your fate!
the best men donned the best, the worst the worst and soon as they strapped the bronze around their bodies, out they moved and the god of earthquakes led them on, grasping his terrible long sword in his massive hand, the grip of power, the blade like a lightning flash
aeneas struggled long, wasting time on the tough stump, no power of his could loose the timber’s stubborn bite
but till that hour i will never cease my anger
then all night long till the breaking light of day we keep the watch fires blazing, hundreds of fires and the rising glare can leap and hit the skies, so the long-haired achaeans stand no chance tonight to cut and run on the sea's broad back
she flung to the winds her glittering headdress, the cap and the coronet, braided band and veil, all the regalia golden aphrodite gave her once, the day that hector, helmet aflash in sunlight, led her home to troy from her father's house with countless wedding gifts to win her heart
and there was mnestheus too, his glory riding high with yesterday’s triumph—driving turnus off the walls— and capys too, whose name comes down to us in capua, the famed campanian town
he set two-handled jars of honey and oil beside him, leaned them against the bier — and then with wild zeal slung the bodies of four massive stallions onto the pyre and gave a wrenching groan
i call on the springs and streams, the gods enthroned in the arching sky and gods of the deep blue sea!
eyes widening, noble hera coaxed him further: so troubled, sleep, why torture yourself with that?
aeneas broke in now, for he saw a young man walking at marcellus’ side, handsome, striking, his armor burnished bright but his face showed little joy, his eyes cast down
he will never force the man to go
at last, gaining the door of father’s ancient house, my first concern was to find the man, my first wish to spirit him off, into the high mountain range, but father, seeing ilium razed from the earth, refused to drag his life out now and suffer exile
ascanius strong as a god and phorcys led the phrygians in from ascania due east, primed for the clash of combat
then, tired of all delays, of ripping out the shafts— outmatched, on the defensive—aeneas now at last, at his wit’s end, bursts forth and hurls his spear and it splits the temples of mezentius’ warhorse
why, you have paphus, idalia, steep cythera too— why tamper with brute italians, a city rife with war?
that’s not how father, the old soldier, opheltes, brought me up in the thick of the greek terror, the death-throes at troy
and teucer gave his captain a faultless answer: great field marshal, why bother to spur me on?
by this sign, after thirty years have made their rounds ascanius will establish alba, bright as the city’s name
does someone need me?
he suddenly feared for red-haired menelaus but diomedes strong with the war cry answered, is that an order?
but admetus' son eumelus came in last of all
when will you ever let them lift the siege?
trust me, either the greeks are hiding, shut inside those beams, or the horse is a battle-engine geared to breach our walls, spy on our homes, come down on our city, overwhelm us— or some other deception’s lurking deep inside it
they stowed them safe in his shelters, settled the women and proud henchmen drove the teams to his herds
turnus, soon as he saw aeneas falling back from the lines, his chiefs in disarray, ignites with a blaze of hope
such limited vengeance hurts me most of all — but i intend that we will part in peace, at last, trojans and achaeans
then liris, pagasus over him: liris struggling to clutch his reins, thrown from his horse as it goes sprawling under him—pagasus rushes to help his falling comrade, reaches out with an unarmed hand and both of them side by side pitch headlong down
adamas, asius' son, and asius son of hyrtacus — where's othryoneus, tell me
the point impaled his shield, a flimsy defense for the youngster’s brash threats, and the shirt his mother wove him of soft gold mesh and his lap filled up with blood, and then his life slipped through the air, sorrowing down to the shades and left his corpse behind
if i slip inside the gates and walls, polydamas will be first to heap disgrace on me — he was the one who urged me to lead our trojans back to ilium just last night, the disastrous night achilles rose in arms like a god
on the same night theano brought into light the son of amycus, hecuba, great with the torch, bore paris
pleading, springing up with a two-handled cup, he reached it toward his loving mother's hands with his own winning words: patience, mother!
while the men themselves, armed for full assault, leapt down and swarmed to the trench's edge on foot and a long undying roar went up in the early dawn
and now the two returned to the halls of mighty zeus — hera of argos, boeotian athena, guard of armies, both had stopped the murderous ares' cutting men to pieces
so the pilot countered, iron grip on the tiller, never loosing his grasp, his eyes fixed on the stars
i urge you, mother — you know that i am right — work back into his good graces, so the father, our beloved father will never wheel on us again, send our banquets crashing!
go on, now mock our courage with high and mighty talk!
that day he sent you out of phthia to agamemnon
but your queen has not deserted you, shorn of honor, not in your hour of death, nor will your death lack glory among the race of man, nor will you bear the shame of dying unavenged
mortal labor — the sweat i poured, my horses panting, spent from launching achaea's armies, heaping pains on priam and priam's sons
odius and eurybates, you escort them
but you won’t escape my blade, whirling in my right hand, cries turnus
no, medon formed them up, oileus' bastard son whom rhene bore to oileus, grim raider of cities
and swift achilles kept on coursing hector, nonstop as a hound in the mountains starts a fawn from its lair, hunting him down the gorges, down the narrow glens and the fawn goes to ground, hiding deep in brush but the hound comes racing fast, nosing him out until he lands his kill
i fathered hero sons in the wide realm of troy and now not a single one is left, i tell you
but the mortals there soon nursed a fallen immortal back to life
it's sacrilege for a single drop to touch my head till i place patroclus on his pyre and heap his mound and cut my hair for him — for a second grief this harsh will never touch my heart while i am still among the living
surely his body can be pierced by bronze, even his — he has only one life, and people say he's mortal: it's only the son of cronus handing him the glory
while he spoke, evander had marked his eyes, his features, his whole frame, and now he replies, pointedly: bravest of the trojans, how i welcome you, recognize you, with all my heart!
for my own father—now i remember—anchises left to me these secret signs of fate: when, my son, borne to an unknown shore, reduced to iron rations, hunger drives you to eat your own platters, then’s the moment, exhausted as you are, to hope for home
shrilling a woman’s cries and tearing her hair, insane, she rushes onto the high walls, seeking the front ranks posted there—without a thought for the fighters, none for the perils, the spears, no, she fills the air with wails of mourning: you— is this you i see, euryalus?
and spinning in terror off he ran but as he spun odysseus plunged a spear in his back between the shoulders — straight through his chest the shaft came jutting out and down socus crashed, odysseus vaunting over him: socus, son of hippasus, skilled breaker of horses, so, death in its rampage outraced you — no escape
nobody boasted he had struck aeneas
and out he marched, leading the way from council
and he sets afield a pair of trophies for the boxing: for the winner a bull with gilded horns and wreaths, a sword and a burnished helm to console the loser
but now the father gave it over to hector to guard his head in war since hector's death was closing on him quickly
but the trojan captains recognized the god, his immortal arms, and heard his arrows rustling in his quiver as he flew
why waste your breath?
and he shows him the grove of hallowed argiletum too, he swears by the spot, retells the death of argus, once his guest
do not pass over the better man and pick the worse
the men were forced to their seats, marshaled into ranks, the shouting died away
just as he dragged that corpse the brave agenor spied his ribs, bared by his shield as he bent low — agenor stabbed with a bronze spear and loosed his limbs, his life spirit left him and over his dead body now the savage work went on, achaeans and trojans mauling each other there like wolves, leaping, hurtling into each other, man throttling man
many a sleepless night i have bivouacked in harness, day after bloody day i have hacked my passage through, fighting other soldiers to win their wives as prizes
nothing can save you now — not even your silver-whirling, mighty-tiding river — not for all the bulls you have slaughtered to it for years, the rearing stallions drowned alive in its eddies
young men all come pouring from homes and fields and crowding mothers marvel, stare at her as she strides— awestruck, breathless, how the beauty of royal purple cloaks her glossy shoulders!
yes, thanks to you i rule this humble little kingdom of mine
there is an island fronting the bay of syracuse—over against plemyrium’s headland rocked by breakers—called ortygia once by men in the old days
down come the sails, the crewmen leap to the oars, no time to lose, they bend to it, churn the spray and sweep the clear blue sea
why, he would leap to accuse a friend without a fault
so she wavered, but the earth already held them fast, long dead in the life-giving earth of lacedaemon, the dear land of their fathers
none more just, none more devoted to duty, none more brave in arms
where have the fighting taunts all gone?
i see with my own eyes how zeus has blocked their finest archer's arrows
and the iron warrior brought his brother round — rough justice, fitting too
priam wept freely for man-killing hector, throbbing, crouching before achilles' feet as achilles wept himself, now for his father, now for patroclus once again, and their sobbing rose and fell throughout the house
finally diomedes lord of the war cry broke forth: atrides — i will be first to oppose you in your folly, here in assembly, king, where it's the custom
and he forged a fallow field, broad rich plowland tilled for the third time, and across it crews of plowmen wheeled their teams, driving them up and back and soon as they would reach the end-strip, moving into the turn, a man would run up quickly and hand them a cup of honeyed, mellow wine as the crews would turn back down along the furrows, pressing again to reach the end of the deep fallow field and the earth churned black behind them, like earth churning, solid gold as it was — that was the wonder of hephaestus' work
one hope saves the defeated: they know they can’t be saved!
does he still love his mother lost and gone?
the mass of troops i could never tally, never name, not even if i had ten tongues and ten mouths, a tireless voice and the heart inside me bronze, never unless you muses of olympus, daughters of zeus whose shield is rolling thunder, sing, sing in memory all who gathered under troy
come here, old friend, stand by me!
but father anchises lifts his eyes to the stars in joy and stretching his hands toward the sky, sings out: almighty jove!
it is no small labor to rescue all mankind, every mother's son
and next, once day broke in the east and put the stars to flight, aeneas summons his crews from down along the beach and greets them all from a mounded rise of ground: gallant sons of dardanus, born of the gods’ high blood, the wheeling year has passed, rounding out its months, since we committed to earth my godlike father’s bones, his relics, and sanctified the altars with our tears
quick, my friends, stand by him!
now, not far from here agylla city stands, founded on age-old rock by lydian people once, brilliant in war, who built on etruscan hilltops
why look, that man is worth an entire army, the fighter zeus holds dear with all his heart — how he exalts him now and mauls achaea's forces!
his war-belt lay beside him, gleaming in all its fire
but now, as it is, let him die and pay his debt to the trojans, pay with his own loyal blood
and they have no stomach left to fight to the end against the warships' sterns
strewn across the world, we all have borne unspeakable punishments, yes, we’ve paid the price in full for all our crimes
on one flank, caesar augustus leading italy into battle, the senate and people too, the gods of hearth and home and the great gods themselves
save your strength for better times to come
true, and what profit for us in the long run?
so he gloried but queen hera stirred in outrage, she shook on her throne and mount olympus quaked as she cried in the face of the rugged god poseidon, you ruthless — the earth-shaker with all your power — not even a twinge of pity deep inside your heart for all these argives dying!
what shattering anguish i would have suffered then if thetis had not taken me to her breast, eurynome too, the daughter of ocean's stream that runs around the world
only the twin snakes escape, sliding off and away to the heights of troy where the ruthless goddess holds her shrine, and there at her feet they hide, vanishing under minerva’s great round shield
and he forged on the shield two noble cities filled with mortal men
and zeus heard the chaos, throned on olympus heights, and laughed deep in his own great heart, delighted to see the gods engage in all-out conflict
they clung to their deathless hate of sacred troy, priam and priam's people, just as they had at first when paris in all his madness launched the war
if such a glorious destiny cannot fire your spirit, [if you will not shoulder the task for your own fame,] at least remember ascanius rising into his prime, the hopes you lodge in iulus, your only heir— you owe him italy’s realm, the land of rome!
and penthesilea leading her amazons bearing half-moon shields— she blazes with battle fury out in front of her army, cinching a golden breastband under her bared breast, a girl, a warrior queen who dares to battle men
i broke the faith i swore to the ashes of sychaeus
now a sharp ridge rises out in front of troy, all on its own and far across the plain with running-room around it, all sides clear
i will tell of horrendous wars, tell of battle lines and princes fired with courage, driven to their deaths, etruscan battalions, all hesperia called to arms
deucalion next — he lanced his arm with a bronze-shod spear, he spitted the trojan through where the elbow-tendons grip and there he stood, waiting achilles, arm dangling heavy, staring death in the face — and achilles chopped his neck and his sword sent head and helmet flying off together and marrow bubbling up from the clean-cut neckbone
but king agamemnon would not stop the quarrel, the first threat he hurled against achilles
achilles was lifting his spirits with it now, singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes
they all collected now, crowding into the royal halls through milling streets
these rites to jove of the styx that i have set in motion, i yearn to consummate them, end the pain of love, give that cursed trojan’s pyre to the flames
whose life would weigh him down to death?
you could hear some trojan or achaean calling, zeus — god of greatness, god of glory, all you immortals!
then they collected the white bones of hector — all his brothers, his friends-in-arms, mourning, and warm tears came streaming down their cheeks
in their command sailed thirty long curved ships
idomeneus cut down phaestus, maeonian bonis' son who shipped to troy from the good rich earth of tarne
after them, fast, full gallop!
hold on, full force — spur all our men to battle!
but he raged on, grimly camped by his fast fleet, the royal son of peleus, the swift runner achilles
then in the first light when we can trust the waves—a breeze has calmed the surf and a gentle rustling southwind makes the rigging sing, inviting us to sea—my crewmen crowd the beaches, launch the ships, and out from port we sail, leaving the land and cities sinking in our wake
and i thought his vaunts were empty, hollow boasting
they wage a relentless war against the latin people
camilla could skim the tips of the unreaped crops, never bruising the tender ears in her swift rush or wing her way, hovering over the mid-sea swell and never dip her racing feet in the waves
so she mocked, and the father of gods and mortals smiled broadly, calling the golden aphrodite over: fighting is not for you, my child, the works of war
next the men who held the strong-built city of athens, realm of high-hearted erechtheus
what heartbreak, now you lie in an unknown land, fresh game for the dogs and birds of latium!
gripping a sturdy spear, bronze-edged and sharp, he no sooner left his tent than stopped at once — what a grim, degrading piece of work he saw
he went on the run to achaea's ships and shelters, out for the heavy lance he would left aslant his hut
and he set to stripping his kill, paeon's spearman son
when he heard that, diomedes' spirits lifted
not that one trojan will ever take your lead — i will never permit it
let him whip the achaeans in headlong panic rout and roll them back once more, tumbling back on the oar-swept ships of peleus' son achilles
and men who lived in zelea under the foot of ida, a wealthy clan that drank the aesepus' dark waters — trojans all, and the shining son of lycaon led them on, pandarus, with the bow that came from apollo's own hands
zeus's daughter athena tended him once the grain-giving fields had borne him, long ago, and then she settled the king in athens, in her own rich shrine, where sons of athens worship him with bulls and goats as the years wheel round in season
oh, now at last i know the griefs of exile— i, in all my pain—at last a wound strikes home
mnestheus riding high, the higher for his success— oars at a racing stroke, wind at his beck and call— shoots into open water, homing down the coast
death never came, so now i can only waste away in tears
then the priceless ransom for hector's body: hauling it up from the vaults they piled it high on the wagon's well-made cradle, then they yoked the mules — stamping their sharp hoofs, trained for heavy loads — that the mysians once gave priam, princely gifts
how strong was achilles?
acestes, first to rush to his aged friend, pities entellus, hoists him off the ground
in her two sons' command sailed thirty long curved ships
phylas' daughter, polymela the gorgeous dancer bore the man when irresistible hermes, hermes the giant-killer lusted for her once — she ravished the god's bright eyes, swaying among the dancers singing goddess artemis with arrow of gold and cry that halloos the hunt
taking the trojans on alone, on the front lines but your comrade's dead, look, and hector himself, strapped in achilles' armor, swaggers on in glory!
both hands clawing the ground for soot and filth, he poured it over his head, fouled his handsome face and black ashes settled onto his fresh clean war-shirt
other hands can defend our city walls
wavering back and forth as their two attackers closed in a rush, whipping that purebred team along and pandarus shouted first, what mad bravado — lofty tydeus' boy will brave it out!
and now no man who waded into that work could scorn it any longer, anyone still not speared or stabbed by tearing bronze who whirled into the heart of all that slaughter — not even if great athena led him by the hand, flicking away the weapons hailing down against him
now — come, let's go to bed, let's lose ourselves in love!
a joy to your rivals, rank disgrace to yourself
but i, our home in flames, was shipped over strange seas, i bowed to the high and mighty pride of achilles’ son, produced him a child—in slavery
bear him first to his place of rest, bury him in his tomb
you are nothing to me — you and your overweening anger!
with that he dons androgeos’ crested helmet, his handsome blazoned shield and straps a greek sword to his hip, and comrades, spirits rising, take his lead
refrain from going hand to hand with the trojans!
when they had put aside desire for food and drink each went his way and slept in his own shelter
come, all we can do now is sit in the halls, far from our son, and wail for hector
the gods gave him beauty and the fine, gallant traits that go with men
who can stand against you?
go to athena's shrine, the queen of plunder, go with offerings, gather the older noble women and take a robe, the largest, loveliest robe that you can find throughout the royal halls, a gift that far and away you prize most yourself, and spread it out across the sleek-haired goddess' knees
little iulus, clutching my right hand, keeps pace with tripping steps
the entire army answers his call to arms and brazen trumpets blast their harsh assent
the champion, never slowed by a fall, unshaken, goes back to fight and all the fiercer, anger fueling his power now, shame fires him up, and a sense of his own strength
his spear aimed in the melee — but adamas, asius' son missed nothing, he saw it all, rushed him, rammed antilochus' buckler dead center with sharp bronze but the blue-haired god poseidon crushed the spear, denied him the argive's life
juturna, terror-struck at the thought, the woman warrior knocks metiscus, turnus’ charioteer, from between the reins he grasps and leaves him sprawling far from the chariot pole as she herself takes over, shaking the rippling reins like metiscus to the life, his voice, his build, his gear
but he was a lightweight, trailed by a tiny band
now we will see, once and for all we will know if he returns as fast from his newest destination — or the firm life-giving earth can hold him down, the grave that hugs the strongest man alive
but soon as the lapiths saw the trojans storm the wall, and cries broke from the argives lost in sudden panic, then the two burst forth to fight before the gates like wild boars, a pair of them up on the hilltops bracing to take some breakneck rout of men and dogs and the two go slanting in on the charge, shattering timber round about them, shearing off the trunks at the roots and a grinding, screeching clatter of tusks goes up till a hunter spears them, tears their lives out — so the clatter screeched from the gleaming bronze that cased their chests as blows piled on blows
what good's to be won from tears that chill the spirit?
and so their spirits soared as they took positions down the passageways of battle all night long, and the watchfires blazed among them
turnus can sooner burn the ocean dry than burn these sacred pines of mine
apollo the son of zeus and leto
i bring you a message sent by zeus, a world away but he has you in his heart, he pities you now
arms, my comrades, bring me arms!
as long as morning rose and the blessed day grew stronger, the weapons hurtled side-to-side and men kept falling
tearing his hair, defiling it with his own hands
here the enormous whirlpool gapes aswirl with filth, seethes and spews out all its silt in the wailing river
but thetis, clasping his knees, held on, clinging, pressing her question once again: grant my prayer, once and for all
not even they could bring his fighting spirit round until, at last, rocks were raining down on the chamber, curetes about to mount the towers and torch the great city!
priam and noble trojans command me to report, if it proves acceptable, pleasing to one and all, the offer of paris who caused our long hard campaign
as i scanned the horizon, yours were the first ships that i’d seen come ashore
obey me, all you argives
down he went, crushed by racing achilles' hands, destroyed in the river where he slaughtered other trojans too
where can he aim his rage?
he rose from his seat, not moving toward the center
and despite the god's undying lust for battle ares might have wasted away there on the spot if the monsters' stepmother, beautiful eriboea had not sent for hermes, and out of the cauldron hermes stole him away — the war-god breathing his last, all but broken down by the ruthless iron chains
who could deny your nerve there, your fighting hands?
all his paternal care is focused on his son
the old majestic priam gave his answer: dear woman, surely i wo not resist your urging now
i’ve journeyed through the course that fortune charted for me
look how they wear you out, the sons of achaea — curse them — battling round our walls!
agonizing now he probed his own great heart: why, why?
straightway rumor flies through libya’s great cities, rumor, swiftest of all the evils in the world
athenians all, and peteos' son menestheus led them on, and no one born on the earth could match that man in arraying teams of horse and shielded fighters — nestor his only rival, thanks to nestor's age
the archer sent them a bracing following wind, they stepped the mast, spread white sails wide, the wind hit full and the canvas bellied out and a dark blue wave, foaming up at the bow, sang out loud and strong as the ship made way, skimming the whitecaps, cutting toward her goal
they’re dazed, they’ve just debarked, they’ve got no land-legs yet!
the deathless aphrodite sank in dione's lap and her mother, folding her daughter in her arms, stroked her gently, whispered her name and asked, who has abused you now, dear child, tell me, who of the sons of heaven so unfeeling, cruel?
so aeneas says, in tears, turning back to his gates where pallas’ lifeless body lay outspread, guarded by old acoetes
but sarpedon hurled next with a flashing lance and missed his man but he hit the horse bold dancer, stabbing his right shoulder and down the stallion went, screaming his life out, shrieking down in the dust as his life breath winged away
i am on my way with a message for achilles, our great man of war — the plan that nestor, achaea's watch and ward, urged me to report
now, at this point, torn as i am with doubts, here is what i propose
with those words, fully aware, he offers up his throat to the sword and across his armor pours his life in waves of blood
just because some god exalts you in battle you think you can beat the rest at tactics too
all our argives dying there in droves!
the more he vaunted the more the river's anger rose, churning at heart for a way to halt his rampage, godlike achilles, and stop the trojans' rout
and iris racing the wind went veering off and priam ordered his sons to get a wagon ready, a good smooth-running one, to hitch the mules and strap a big wicker cradle across its frame
and there was helen of argos, sitting with all the women of the house, directing the rich embroidered work they had in hand
this maneuver will never work for them, this scheme they hatched for the moment as i raged on and on
not when i stormed europa, far-famed phoenix' daughter who bore me minos and rhadamanthys grand as gods
and now as he glanced back at achaea's troops and ships he tore out his hair by the roots, he looked to zeus on high, groaning from the depths of his proud, embattled heart
there lies my wealth, hoards of it, all i left behind when i sailed to troy on this, this insane voyage — and still more hoards from here: gold, ruddy bronze, women sashed and lovely, and gleaming gray iron, and i will haul it home, all i won as plunder
so he cried, driving them on, and all ears rang with his cries and a tight phalanx launched straight at the wall, brandishing sharp spears, swarming the bastions as hector grappled a boulder, bore it up and on
holding formation now the trojans rolled across it, apollo heading them, gripping the awesome storm-shield and he tore that argive rampart down with the same ease some boy at the seashore knocks sand castles down — he no sooner builds his playthings up, child's play, than he wrecks them all with hands and kicking feet, just for the sport of it
like shoals of fish darting before some big-bellied dolphin, escaping, cramming the coves of a good deepwater harbor, terrified for their lives — he devours all he catches — so the trojans down that terrible river's onrush cowered under its bluffs
as ajax heaved him up odysseus never missed a trick — he kicked him behind the knee, clipping the hollow, cut his legs from under him, knocked him backward — pinned as odysseus flung himself across his chest!
we’ll hunt these trojans down where victory opens up the first way in
the fourth was led by the old horseman phoenix, alcimedon led the fifth, laerces' gallant son
the troops were sleeping, weary from pitching camp, their weapons piled beside them on the ground, three neat rows of the burnished well-kept arms and beside each man his pair of battle-horses
with that sleep went drifting off to the famous tribes of men, stirring poseidon even more to defend the argives
so come, follow my orders
the greeks charged him with treason, a trumped-up charge, an innocent man, and just because he opposed the war they put him to death, but once he’s robbed of the light, they mourn him sorely
let each fighter think of his own wife, his home, remember the great works, the triumphs of our fathers
our aides will handle them — we will steer these racers straight at the trojans now, the great breakers of horses
this is the twelfth day he's lain there, too, but his body has not decayed, not in the least, nor have the worms begun to gnaw his corpse, the swarms that devour men who fall in battle
recognizing the fury’s ruffling wings at a distance, wretched juturna tears her hair, nails clawing her face, fists beating her breast, and cries to her brother: how, turnus, how can your sister help you now?
halting close beside it, he taunted fighting menelaus: back, high and mighty atrides, captain of armies — back from the corpse, and leave the bloody gear!
so he pleaded, lost in his own great innocence
fight like men, my comrades — call up your battle-fury!
not a word in reply to that from the archer-god but zeus's regal consort flew into rage at once and her outburst raked the huntress armed with arrows: how do you have the gall, you shameless bitch, to stand and fight me here?
she feared some argive fast with chariot-team might hurl bronze in his chest and rip his life out
the great man of war breaking into a broad smile, his gaze fixed on his son, in silence
oh no, when they were flung loose from their native land i dared to hunt those exiles through the breakers, battle them down the ocean far and wide
rearing, bolting in terror down the plain his horses snared themselves in tamarisk branches, splintered his curved chariot just at the pole's tip and breaking free they made a dash for the city walls where battle-teams by the drove stampeded back in panic
suddenly strange light flares from turnus’ eyes and his armor clangs, horrific, the blood-red plumes shake on his head and his shield shoots bolts of lightning
they look our way in despair, they must
he burst into tears, pleading, take me alive!
how much lighter the war would be for trojans then if you, their greatest scourge, were dead and gone!
now then, you have heard, great king, the king’s response, the view he takes of this mighty war of ours
the contingents scattered, each to its own ship
but if you long so deeply to know what we went through, to hear, in brief, the last great agony of troy, much as i shudder at the memory of it all— i shrank back in grief—i’ll try to tell it now
since all the sibyl foretold of you was true, misenus, all too true
but aeneas, taking a long, deep breath, replied, do not think for a moment, achilles, son of peleus, you can frighten me with words like a child, a fool — i am an old hand myself at trading taunts and insults
by now dank night had nearly reached her turning-point in the sky, and stretched on the hard thwarts beneath their oars the crews gave way to a deep, quiet rest, when down from the stars the god of sleep came gliding gently, cleaving the dark mists and scattering shadows, hunting you, palinurus, bringing you fatal sleep in all your innocence
or let him reign over those he’s beaten down
here is our brother eryx’ land
well, look at these alarms!
but aeneas turned and gave the god an answer: son of priam, why press me to go against achilles?
safeguard this second troy, this remnant left by the greeks and cruel achilles
well you know how to double round the post
alcimedon sprang aboard the hurtling chariot, quickly grasping the whip and reins in both fists as automedon leapt to ground
no, what lasting thanks in the long run for warring with our enemies, on and on, no end?
— and she's just returned from olympian zeus, just now
and all in an onrush dark as autumn days when the whole earth flattens black beneath a gale, when zeus flings down his pelting, punishing rains — up in arms, furious, storming against those men who brawl in the courts and render crooked judgments, men who throw all rights to the winds with no regard for the vengeful eyes of the gods — so all their rivers crest into flood spate, ravines overflowing cut the hilltops off into lonely islands, the roaring flood tide rolling down to the storm-torn sea, headlong down from the foothills washes away the good plowed worfk of men — rampaging so, the gasping trojan war-teams hurtled on
our prince of beauty — mad for women, you lure them all to ruin!
then back to her mighty father's sturdy halls she went as troops moved out, pouring out of the fast trim ships
if ever in argos' golden wheatlands one of us burned the fat thighs of sheep or bulls and begged a safe return and you promised with a nod — remember it now, olympian
three daughters are mine in my well-built halls — chrysothemis and laodice and iphianassa — and he may lead away whichever one he likes, with no bride-price asked, home to peleus' house
and the trojan front shrank back, glorious hector too as the argives yelled and dragged away the corpses, pushing on, breakneck on
there our orders say to place our gifts
to kill him too in this present bloody rampage over sarpedon's splendid body?
he dragged the heavy spear of hardened socus squelching out of his own wound and bulging shield
achilles swarms over them — they are stampeding, a terrible mauling's coming
he struck him full in the right shoulder, under the breastplate's hollow the ripping point tore deep, shearing its way through, armor splattered with blood as pandarus triumphed, shouting over tydides wildly, move up, attack, my high-hearted trojans, lash your stallions!
aeneas erupts in anger, stung by treachery now and seeing turnus’ horses swing his chariot round and speed away, over and over he calls out to jove, to the altars built for the treaty now a shambles
with that, cocking back his arm he sends the javelin whirring on and the river roars out as over the churning rapids poor camilla flies along on the whizzing shaft
just say the word—i’ll lead my prize away
if we all formed up along the ships right now, our best men picked for an ambush — that's where you really spot a fighter's mettle, where the brave and craven always show their stripes
he sank on the spot, hunched in his dear companion's arms, gasping out his life as he writhed along the ground like an earthworm stretched out in death, blood pooling, soaking the earth dark red
let bygones be bygones now
antilochus sprang, he plunged a sword in his temple and mydon, gasping, hurled from his bolted car facefirst, head and shoulders stuck in a dune a good long time for the sand was soft and deep — his lucky day — till his own horses trampled him down, down flat as antilochus lashed them hard and drove them back to achaea's waiting ranks
now closer, closing, front to front in the onset till paris sprang from the trojan forward ranks, a challenger, lithe, magnificent as a god, the skin of a leopard slung across his shoulders, a reflex bow at his back and battle-sword at hip and brandishing two sharp spears tipped in bronze he strode forth, challenging all the argive best to fight him face-to-face in mortal combat
and the men obeyed the swift runner's orders
at that moment, cries— they could hear them now, a crescendo of wailing, ghosts of infants weeping, robbed of their share of this sweet life, at its very threshold too: all, snatched from the breast on that black day that swept them off and drowned them in bitter death
not one of them dared to sit for terror seized them all — the great achilles who held back from the brutal fray so long had just come blazing forth
how many fewer friends had gnawed the dust of the wide world, brought down by enemy hands while i raged on and on
tell me, sibyl, what are the punishments, why this scourging?
the god of battle is in your hands, my men
no, this fate was assigned to me in my old age
but the hearty son of anchises tests their heft, turning over and over the heavy coiling straps
yet two men there, famous fighters, antilochus flanking thrasymedes still had not caught word of patroclus' death: they thought the gallant soldier still alive, fighting trojans up on the clashing front lines
the trojans roared assent, lost in folly
just let him see menelaus, atreus' fighting son brought down by your shaft and hoisted onto his pyre, mourned with grief and tears!
and then you will learn your entire race to come and the city walls that will be made your own
now will you take me to your ships or leave me here — bound and gagged right here?
but the goddess roused him on, her eyes blazing: true son of tydeus, diomedes, joy of my heart!
oh if only the gods loved him as much as i do
down on the trojan front he swept like something superhuman and now from his deep whirls the river roared to phoebus, disgrace — god of the silver bow and born of zeus!
a crier put a staff in his hands and called for silence
now aeneas, standing high astern, no sooner catches a glimpse of his own trojan camp than he quickly hoists his burnished, brazen shield in his left hand
dogs and vultures would eat his fallen corpse at once!
nothing among the greeks, no place at all
nearby, there’s procas, pride of the trojan people, then come capys, numitor, and the one who revives your name, silvius aeneas, your equal in arms and duty, famed, if he ever comes to rule the alban throne
who has words to capture that night’s disaster, tell that slaughter?
i am all alone, defend me!
but marshal agamemnon called out to the armies, hear me now, you trojans, dardans, trojan allies!
but young ascanius, deep in the valley, rides his eager mount and relishing every stride, outstrips them all, now goats, now stags, but his heart is racing, praying— if only they’d send among this feeble, easy game some frothing wild boar or a lion stalking down from the heights and tawny in the sun
and achilles sprang up with a start and staring wide, drove his fists together and cried in desolation, ah god!
indeed, an age will come, as the long years slip by, when assaracus’ royal house will quell achilles’ homeland, brilliant mycenae too, and enslave their people, rule defeated argos
mestor the indestructible, troilus, passionate horseman and hector, a god among men — no son of a mortal man, he seemed a deathless god's
we are the gods, with you at the helm, who crossed the billowing sea in ships
and the argives wheeled and gave ground quickly
they have bucklers to shield their left side, sickle-swords for combat, cut-and-thrust
boasting you would face achilles man-to-man in battle!
fight it out with each other, duel before the troops!
landing, we just begin to admire apollo’s city when king anius, king of men and priest of the god, his brow wreathed with the bands and holy laurel leaves, comes to meet us, spotting a long-lost friend, anchises
and you too, your fate awaits you too, godlike as you are, achilles — to die in battle beneath the proud rich trojans' walls!
but let's trade armor
priam must not see his son
urging so, but at first the women wavered, looking back at the ships with hateful glances, torn between their hapless love for the land they stood on now and the fated kingdom, calling still—when all at once the goddess towered into the sky on balanced wings, cleaving a giant rainbow, flying beneath the clouds
as a stallion full-fed at the manger, stalled too long, breaking free of his tether gallops down the plain, out for his favorite plunge in a river's cool currents, thundering in his pride — his head flung back, his mane streaming over his shoulders, sure and sleek in his glory, knees racing him on to the fields and stallion-haunts he loves — so hector hurtled on, his legs driving, his knees pumping, spurring his reinsmen once he heard the god's command
look at the power they display and the oakleaf civic crowns that shade their foreheads
all the lookout peaks stand out and the jutting cliffs and the steep ravines and down from the high heavens bursts the boundless bright air and all the stars shine clear and the shepherd's heart exults — so many fires burned between the ships and the xanthus' whirling rapids set by the men of troy, bright against their walls
so turnus blazes up into full explosive fury, bursting out at the king with reckless words: turnus spurns all delay!
so he threatened but the dogs were not about to feed on hector
versatile odysseus took the helm as captain
his own huge spear— the fighter luckily bore it in his grip— rugged with knots, the oakwood charred hard
the king himself pitched in with the lead heralds, summoning troops
come, tell me the truth now, point by point
as thick as leaves in autumn woods at the first frost that slip and float to earth, or dense as flocks of birds that wing from the heaving sea to shore when winter’s chill drives them over the waves to landfalls drenched in sunlight
as crimson as indian ivory stained with ruddy dye or white lilies aglow in a host of scarlet roses, so mixed the hues that lit the young girl’s face
as a burly farmhand wielding a whetted ax, chopping a field-ranging bull behind the horns, hacks through its whole hump and the beast heaves up then topples forward — so aretus reared, heaving up then toppled down on his back
how on earth can a man rage on forever?
that was all, and patroclus armed himself in achilles' gleaming bronze
pity the son and father, i pray you, kindly lady!
brave patroclus first — just as areilycus swerved in sudden flight he gored him in the hip with a slashing spear and the bronze lancehead hammered through his flesh, the shaft splintering bone as he pitched face-first, pounding the ground — and veteran menelaus wounded thoas, raking his chest where the shield-rim left it bare, and loosed his limbs — and amphiclus went for meges but meges saw him coming and got in first by far, spearing him up the thigh where it joins the body, the spot where a man's muscle bunches thickest: the tough sinews shredded around the weapon's point as the dark swirled down his eyes — nestor's sons on attack!
your old affection for your people?
our team could race with the rush of the west wind, the strongest, swiftest blast on earth, men say — still you are doomed to die by force, achilles, cut down by a deathless god and mortal man!
close range too, hector stabbed the wrist of leitus, brave alectryon's son, and knocked him out of action
what noble parents produced so fine a daughter?
no one may pass below the secret places of earth before he plucks the fruit, the golden foliage of that tree
it's no longer ghastly war for troy and achaea — now, i tell you, the argives fight the gods!
they made three rapid charges, three lunges and then — ajax stabbed through tydides' round balanced shield but failed to reach his flesh — saved by the breastplate just behind the buckler!
what bad luck — to snatch this curved bow off its peg that day i marched my trojans hard to your lovely town of troy, to please prince hector
and with that threat he called out to his horses, golden and whitefoot, blaze and silver flash!
a flash of his helmet as rangy hector shook his head: ajax, royal son of telamon, captain of armies, do not toy with me like a puny, weak-kneed boy or a woman never trained in works of war!
next laocoön rushing quick to the rescue, clutching his sword— they trap him, bind him in huge muscular whorls, their scaly backs lashing around his midriff twice and twice around his throat—their heads, their flaring necks mounting over their victim writhing still, his hands frantic to wrench apart their knotted trunks, his priestly bands splattered in filth, black venom and all the while his horrible screaming fills the skies, bellowing like some wounded bull struggling to shrug loose from his neck an axe that’s struck awry, to lumber clear of the altar
all else is just as your mother promised
but the goddess venus, lustrous among the cloudbanks, bearing her gifts, approached and when she spotted her son alone, off in a glade’s recess by the frigid stream, she hailed him, suddenly there before him: look, just forged to perfection by all my husband’s skill: the gifts i promised!
one love bound them, side by side they’d rush to attack, so now, standing the same watch, they held one gate
they flung wine from their cups and wet the earth and no fighter would dare drink until he would poured an offering out to the overwhelming son of cronus
patroclus, over against him, leapt down from his car and hit the ground, his left hand shaking a spear and seized with his right a jagged, glittering stone his hand could just cover — patroclus flung it hard, leaning into the heave, not backing away from hector, no, and no wasted shot
you want these trojans to pin you against your high sterns beached in the surf?
there is a country— the greeks called it hesperia, land of the west, an ancient land, mighty in war and rich in soil
one girl, chryseis, the fiery-eyed achaeans ferry out in a fast trim ship to chryse island, laden with presents for the god
you heart of iron!
not waiting for welcome the running god of luck went straight up to priam, clasped the old king's hands and asked him warmly, father — where do you drive these mules and team through the godsent night while other mortals sleep?
treasures cram our house, bronze and gold and plenty of well-wrought iron — father would give you anything, gladly, priceless ransom — if only he learns i am still alive in argive ships!
plenty of words there are, all kinds at its command — with all the room in the world for talk to range and stray
i blame no one
but hector seeing his own brother polydorus clutching his entrails, sinking limp to the ground — the mist came swirling down his eyes as well
what insanity shifts my fixed resolve?
why tell me of all that i must do?
oh would to god that i could sink my teeth in his liver, eat him raw!
as his rival passed the red-haired captain cursed him: antilochus — no one alive more treacherous than you!
but when they spun their appeals before us all, menelaus spoke out quickly — his words racing, few but clear as a bell, nothing long-winded or off the mark, though in fact the man was younger
so vultures will eat them raw, their firm young flesh, and we, we will drag their dear wives and helpless children back to the beaked ships, once we have seized their city!
the horns on its head ran sixteen hands in length and a bowyer good with goat-horn worked them up, fitted, clasped them tight, sanded them smooth and set the golden notch-rings at the tips
so that now the duty's ours — we are the ones to head our lycian front, brace and fling ourselves in the blaze of war, so a comrade strapped in combat gear may say, 'not without fame, the men who rule in lycia, these kings of ours who eat fat cuts of lamb and drink sweet wine, the finest stock we have
fourteen rutulians are picked to guard the ramparts, each commanding a hundred troops, their helmets crested with purple plumes, their war-gear glinting gold
teucer came to sidon once, banished from native ground, searching for new realms, and my father belus helped him
wherever i look, no use, i cannot see the achaean for the mission, such swirling mist blots out the men and horses both
well, once again i am bound to say what i think best
— words still on my lips as he groans in answer: the last day has come for the trojan people, no escaping this moment
or follow you on the run, once i have given the captains your command?
far better then, not now, with the enemy camped before our walls
a month — but look at us
all italy blazed— until that instant all unstirred, inert
i blaze for battle — your taunts ca not turn me back, not till we have fought it out with bronze
and how could hector have fled the fates of death so long?
with his last words he turned in his tracks and went his way
and a powerful, huge man loomed up at once, panopeus' son epeus, the famous boxing champion
why are you cowering here, skulking out of range?
she’d speak her heart but her voice chokes, mid-word
where have i come from?
ah, but little by little a lesser, tarnished age came stealing in, filled with the madness of war, the passion for possessions
hephaestus the master craftsman rose up first to harangue them all, trying now to bring his loving mother a little comfort, the white-armed goddess hera: oh disaster
a swift dark glance and the headstrong runner answered, hector, stop!
till abruptly she cries out in a blaze of fury: no goddess was your mother!
and now their entire army settled down to supper but all night long the argives raised patroclus' dirge
what are your ears for, ares, ca not you hear the truth?
book twelve: the trojans storm the rampart
take them with you as comrades in your fortunes
but zeus turned to hera, his wife and sister, saying, so, my ox-eyed queen, you have had your way at last, setting the famous runner achilles on his feet
that brought his brother's warrior spirit round
and dionysus was terrified, he dove beneath the surf where the sea-nymph thetis pressed him to her breast — dionysus numb with fear: shivers racked his body, thanks to the raucous onslaught of that man
out it flared, the fire inside my soul, my rage ablaze to avenge our fallen country—pay helen back, crime for crime
i will find a way to protect him from those swarms, the vicious flies that devour men who fall in battle
signs from my father’s shrine and a host of omens from the skies forbid me to wed her to a bridegroom chosen from our race
nearby, his brazen helmet swings from a branch and his heavy armor lies on the grass, in peace
or if glory spurs you on, if your strength is still like oak, if the dowry of a palace seems so very dear to your heart, courage!
here vulcan pounded out the salii, dancing priests of mars, the luperci, stripped, their peaked caps wound with wool, bearing their body-shields that dropped from heaven, and chaste matrons, riding in pillowed coaches, led the sacred marches through the city
apollo son of zeus encouraged him still more: hero, why not invoke the deathless gods yourself?
and along came two aides of ares limping in, the battle-hard tydides flanked by good odysseus leaning on their spears, still bearing painful wounds, and slowly found their seats in the front ranks
but lord apollo the distant deadly archer reassured him: courage!
to the rest i would pass on this advice: sail home now!
once before he chased me hard with his spear, down from ida the day he raided our flocks and sacked lyrnessus, pedasus fort as well
no spear rages now in the hand of diomedes, keen to save the argives from disaster
i am the river tiber
a friend lies dead—oh, you could not know— his body pollutes your entire fleet with death while you search on for oracles, linger at our doors
just so one more glory can crown these trojans — god help us, they have beaten us already — and the scales of headlong death can drag us down
come, grant the trojans victory after victory till the achaean armies pay my dear son back, building higher the honor he deserves!
her eyes wide, queen hera shuddered before his thunder, protesting, swearing a flight of winged oaths: earth be my witness now, the vaulting sky above and the dark cascading waters of the styx — i swear by the greatest, grimmest oath that binds the happy gods!
at last, at last i leave the field of battle
zeus who rules the world has ripped his wits away
so they waited, the old chiefs of troy, as they sat aloft the tower
zeus the king of the clouds has pitched on victory for the trojans, not for us
we were both there inside, i and prince odysseus heard it all in the halls, all your father told you
not even if i should learn of my own father's death, who, this moment, is weeping warm tears in phthia, i know it, bereft of a son as loved as this
— because menelaus has beaten your handsome paris and hateful as i am, he longs to take me home?
leave patroclus now to the best men you can find, they will straddle the corpse and fight off trojan packs — you fight the fatal day from us, we are still alive
whenever the senate’s called, you’re first to show your face
she’d still be one of my loyal comrades, still my own dear girl
but come, tell me the truth now, point by point: this treasure — a king's ransom — do you send it off to distant, outland men, to keep it safe for you?
yet jove would not allow those fighters to clash; he saved each man for his own fate, soon now, under a stronger foe
the gods are so much stronger
now, i suppose, the myrmidon captains cringe before the phrygian armies, now diomedes, now larisaean achilles, and aufidus’ rapids rush back from the adriatic’s waves!
as soon as the roasts were done and spread on platters, patroclus brought the bread, set it out on the board in ample wicker baskets
he halts, grasps his bow and his flying arrows, the weapons his trusty aide achates keeps at hand
the other glistens with ivory, radiant, flawless, but through it the dead send false dreams up toward the sky
i’ll state my case in a few words
first he shot into flames and burned the plain, ignited hordes of corpses, squads achilles slaughtered — he scorched the whole plain and the shining river shrank
but all the while my blood runs cold with fear — menoetius' fighting son
a small comfort offered a grief so great but owed to a father’s heartache
but if red-haired menelaus brings down paris, the trojans surrender helen and all her treasures
such service earns such gifts
and so with a few words she turned to barce, sychaeus’ old nurse—her own was now black ashes deep in her homeland lost forever: dear old nurse, send anna my sister to me here
death-cries hit the skies!
the harbors, the battlements planned to block attack, all work’s suspended now, the huge, threatening walls with the soaring cranes that sway across the sky
he said no more
only at chariot-racing the sons of actor beat me — two against one, cutting before me, hellbent to win, for the biggest prize was left for the last event
under his huge weight the earth quakes, his limbs fall limp, his armor splattered with brains, he sprawls on the ground in death—in perfect halves over both his shoulders, right and left, his head goes lolling free
enough terror, juno counters, treachery too
our parents — one pair or the other will mourn a dear son today
and there he lay in the whirling dust, overpowered in all his power and wiped from memory all his horseman's skills
already up on the heights— turn around and look—there’s pallas holding the fortress, flaming out of the clouds, her savage gorgon glaring
when the tenth dawn shone with her rose-red fingers, he began to question him, asked to see his credentials, whatever he brought him from his in-law, proetus
men call it thicket ridge, the immortals call it the leaping amazon myrine's mounded tomb, and there the trojans and allies ranged their troops for battle
this strife, this warfare plaguing all the immortals — hera's all to blame!
where are you headed?
automedon rushed in, wild as the god of war to strip the armor off, shouting in savage exultation, now, by heaven, i have eased the grief of patroclus' ghost a little — though the man i battered down was half as great as he!
and you — the dogs and birds will maul you, shame your corpse while achaeans bury my dear friend in glory!
peleus loved me as a father loves a son, i tell you, his only child, the heir to his boundless wealth, he made me a rich man, he gave me throngs of subjects, i ruled the dolopes, settling down on phthia's west frontier
first he wrapped his legs with well-made greaves, fastened behind the heels with silver ankle-clasps, and next he strapped the breastplate round his chest that cinyras gave him once, a guest-gift long ago
he steadied his balanced shield before his chest, aimed his spear at the man and flung this challenge: surely you must have hoped with all your heart — the great glorious achilles — that you would raze the proud trojans' city this very day!
as thunder at times will split the sky and a trail of fire goes rippling through the clouds, flashing, blinding light— and his wife sensed it all, delighting in her bewitching ways, she knew her beauty’s power
then he sponged off his brow and both burly arms, his massive neck and shaggy chest, pulled on a shirt and grasping a heavy staff, hephaestus left his forge and hobbled on
and so, free of fate’s demand, since they are sworn to a foreign leader now, under the will of god the etruscans set sail
and here are troops of men who had suffered wounds, fighting to save their country, and those who had been pure priests while still alive, and the faithful poets whose songs were fit for phoebus; those who enriched our lives with the newfound arts they forged and those we remember well for the good they did mankind
now, come, you sons of achaea, raise a song of triumph!
there are twin gates of war—so they are called— consecrated by awe and the dread of savage mars, closed fast by a hundred brazen bolts and iron strong forever, nor does janus the watchman ever leave the threshold
the sprinting abantes followed hard at his heels, their forelocks cropped, hair grown long at the back, troops nerved to lunge with their tough ashen spears and slash the enemies' breastplates round their chests
she broke from a cresting wave at first light and soaring up to the broad sky and mount olympus, found the son of cronus gazing down on the world, peaks apart from the other gods and seated high on the topmost crown of rugged ridged olympus
make a mockery of myself, go back to my old suitors, tempt them to try again?
and let us draft a treaty, just in every term, and invite the trojans in to share our kingdom
now, perhaps you’ve caught some rumor of palamedes, belus’ son, and his shining fame that rings in song
with camilla down, the melee peaks to a new pitch, the masses surging forward, the whole trojan army, etruscan captains, evander’s arcadian wings
what you see is your enemy’s camp—you can’t escape!
eyes lowered, her voice subdued, she murmured: she was the one, the happiest one of all, priam’s virgin daughter doomed to die at our enemy’s tomb—achilles— under the looming walls of troy
book nine: the embassy to achilles
so on the trojans came, waves in the vanguard, waves from the rear, closing, bronze men glittering, following captains, closing and hector led the way, a match for murderous ares — priam's son holding his balanced shield before him, tough with oxhides, studded thick with bronze and round his temples the flashing helmet shook
so a knowing seer of the gods would read this omen, someone clear in his mind and skilled with signs, a man the trojan armies would obey
but grief bore down on hector, packing his dark heart as he scanned the battle lines and saw the worst at once: the two men there, one stripping the gleaming armor, the other sprawled on the ground, blood still spurting warm from his slashed throat
tense but no great fear
that is my prayer, my final cry—i pour it out with my own lifeblood
urgings over, out of the gates he strode, immense in strength, waving his massive spear
we no longer gazed in wonder at his looks
in from the blind side he came — agamemnon never saw him — tensed with a spear and slashed him under the elbow, down the forearm — a glint of metal — the point ripped through his flesh and the lord of fighting men atrides shuddered
let him allow us to speak and quit his puffed-up pride, that man whose unholy leadership and twisted ways— oh, i’ll let loose, he can threaten me with death!— so many leading lights among us he’s snuffed out that we see our entire city plunged in grief while he, trusting that he can break and run, attacks the trojans, terrorizing the heavens with his spears!
through so many hard straits, so many twists and turns our course holds firm for latium
mother bore me — even me — not to be a coward through and through
his armor's heaped on the green field but the man keeps ranging the ranks of fighters like a ram — yes, he looks to me like a thick-fleeced bellwether ram making his way through a big mass of sheep-flocks, shining silver-gray
ignite the pyre beneath your luckless dead
but go i shall
within the palace all is decked with adornments, lavish, regal splendor
no one should ever let such nonsense pass his lips, no one with any skill in fit and proper speech — and least of all yourself, a sceptered king
with that vow his mother went away and left him there, alone, his heart inflamed for the sashed and lovely girl they would wrenched away from him against his will
aeneas came to a halt and wept, and oh, achates, he cried, is there anywhere, any place on earth not filled with our ordeals?
i have lost my father
nastes led the carians wild with barbarous tongues, men who held miletus, phthires' ridges thick with timber, maeander's currents and mount mycale's craggy peaks
at last, when the sun's fiery light had set, each immortal went to rest in his own house, the splendid high halls hephaestus built for each with all his craft and cunning, the famous crippled smith
the envoys had barely closed when a troubled groan came murmuring from the italians’ anxious lips and mounted as when the rocks resist a stream in spate and the dammed-up tide goes churning, sounding out as it beats from bank to bank with water roaring white
others were finishing off the dreaded aegis donned by pallas athena blazing up in arms— outdoing themselves with burnished gilded scales, with serpents coiling, writhing around each other, the gorgon herself, the severed head, the rolling eyes, the breastplate forged to guard the goddess’ chest
with that he strode away, a god in the wars of men
the day of infamy soon came
beside him, his son, lausus, second in build and beauty to latian turnus alone: lausus, breaker of horses, hunter of wild game
first to march to war is brutal mezentius, scorner of gods, fresh from the tuscan coasts to deploy his troops for battle
but this achilles — first he slaughters hector, he rips away the noble prince's life then lashes him to his chariot, drags him round his beloved comrade's tomb
all for him we have come, we’ve sailed across the mighty streams of hell
then, they say, ascanius shot for the first time in war the flying arrow he’d saved till now for wild game, routing, terrorizing them, now his bow-hand cut down strong numanus—remulus by family name, just lately bound in marriage to turnus’ younger sister
so the armies met his challenge
yanking out his ashen shaft from your body, back he dashed and lost himself in the crowds — the man would not stand up to patroclus here in mortal combat, stripped, defenseless as he was
and any charioteer who reaches trojan chariots, thrust your spear from your own car, do not throw it!
he was barely out of sight and about to range the plain when captain aeneas, moving through the exposed pass, climbs the ridge and comes forth from the shady woods
but hector ignored the argive masses, killing none, he lashed his pounding stallions straight at patroclus
porsenna, there, commanding romans to welcome banished tarquin back, mounted a massive siege to choke the city—aeneas’ heirs rushing headlong against the steel in freedom’s name
why waste time with talk when the wind is rising?
achilles sprang to his feet, he seemed startled, clasped the two of us by the hand and led us in — he pressed us to take a seat and set before us sumptuous stranger's fare, the stranger's right
so all can reap the benefits of their king — so even mighty atrides can see how mad he was to disgrace achilles, the best of the achaeans!
inside the walls, my boy!
tydides reared and hurled himself again and again, trying to kill aeneas, strip his famous armor
have all trojans and argives take their seats, and you, you challenge achaea's bravest man to duel in bloody combat to the death
there was a world
the first young squadron parades along in triumph led by little priam, who bore his forebear’s name— your noble son, polites, destined to sire italians— riding a thracian stallion dappled white, his pasterns white and prancing, high brow flashing a blaze of white
but he hit his driver — a bastard son of famed king priam, cebriones yanking the reins back taut — right between the eyes
as aeneas and menelaus came within arm's reach, waving whetted spears in each other's faces, nerved to fight it out, antilochus rushed in, tensing shoulder-to-shoulder by his captain now — and aeneas shrank from battle, fast as he was in arms, when he saw that pair of fighters side-by-side, standing their ground against him
it’s too late now for rising up with your groundless accusations—flinging empty slander in my face!
no, let an aide attend you here while i rush back to achilles, spur him into combat
there at the outer gates she met them face-to-face and blocked their path, sounding zeus's orders: where are you rushing now?
adrestus hugged his knees and begged him, pleading, take me alive, atrides, take a ransom worth my life!
find him she did, lycaon's skilled, fearless son, standing by, flanked by the bands of shielded men who would trooped with him from aesepus' dark rapids
but if i get home again and set my eyes on my native land, my wife and my fine house with the high vaulting roof, let some stranger cut my head off then and there if i do not smash this bow and fling it in the fire — the gear i packed is worthless as the wind
there will come a dawn or sunset or high noon when a man will take my life in battle too — flinging a spear perhaps or whipping a deadly arrow off his bow
the father, still bent on plaguing the argives and trojans both with wounds and groans in the bloody press of battle
all their fateful oracles—words from the gods these phrygians bandy about—alarm me not at all
and now, as all the achaean armies massed together, the swift runner achilles rose among them, asking, agamemnon — was it better for both of us, after all, for you and me to rage at each other, raked by anguish, consumed by heartsick strife, all for a young girl?
night had fallen and sleep embraced all living things on earth
now back in their tracks the trojans fled pell-mell while hera spread dense cloud ahead to block their way
he aimed and hurled and his spear's long shadow flew and hit aretus square in the balanced round shield — no blocking the shaft, the bronze rammed through, piercing his belt and gouging down his belly
not a thought in your heads for works of battle
but swayed by the fates, i have my doubts
oh give me your hand — i beg you with my tears!
closing quickly, coming head-to-head the son and the son's son of zeus who marshals storms, tlepolemus opened up to taunt his enemy first: sarpedon, master strategist of the lycians, what compels you to cringe and cower here?
approaching the god who shakes the earth, sleep sent a winged urging: fight for the argives now with all your might!
if only i could hide him away from pain and death, that day his grim destiny comes to take achilles, as surely as glorious armor shall be his, armor that any man in the world of men will marvel at through all the years to come — whoever sees its splendor
victory goes to both
turnus comes, a match for trojans and latins both!
on that warm note latinus picks out horses from his entire stable: three hundred strong, standing sleek in their lofty stalls
mourn for his honor forged of old, his sword arm never conquered in battle
whose gear could i wear?
the swelling rage of the gods has died away
menoetius' gallant son, my headstrong friend!
so come, the glory that will follow the sons of troy through time, your children born of italian stock who wait for life, bright souls, future heirs of our name and our renown: i will reveal them all and tell you of your fate
she stood in front of the horses, crying up at priam, here, quickly — pour a libation out to father zeus!
but now phoenician dido has him in her clutches, holding him back with smooth, seductive words, and i fear the outcome of juno’s welcome here
ilioneus heaving a rock, a huge crag of a rock, brings down lucetius just assaulting the gates with a flaming torch in hand as liger kills emathion, asilas lays out corynaeus, one adept with javelin, one with arrows blindsiding in from a distance— caeneus kills ortygius—turnus, triumphant caeneus— turnus cuts down itys, clonius, dioxippus and promolus, sagaris, idas, posted out in front of the steepest towers, and capys kills privernus
smoldering at the father, seized with wild resentment
oh the torment — never-ending heartbreak!
aconteus, hurled off, drops like a lightning bolt or a dead weight shot forth from a siege engine, heaving headlong far away from his charger, gasping out his life breath on the winds
no word or work of mine — nothing can be revoked, there is no treachery, nothing left unfinished once i bow my head to say it shall be done
he sounds like a man cut off and overpowered, mauled by trojan ranks in the rough assault
her gaze wavering into the high skies, she looked for a ray of light and when she glimpsed it, moaned
death cut him short
breaking into a smile the cool tactician laughed, by god, what heroic gifts you set your heart on — the great achilles' team!
but you go in yourself and clasp achilles' knees, implore him by his father, his mother with lovely hair, by his own son — so you can stir his heart!
in oilean ajax' charge came forty long black ships, locrians living across the straits from sacrosanct euboea
rescue the men of troy and the trojan women — do not hand the great glory to peleus' son, bereft of your own sweet life yourself
and you must hug it close as you haul your team and chariot round but you in your tight-strung car, you lean to the left yourself, just a bit as you whip your right-hand horse, hard, shout him on, slacken your grip and give him rein
now, my king, the achaeans are bent on making you a disgrace in the eyes of every man alive
you — forever faithless!
a gust of the north wind blowing round him carried back the life breath he had gasped away in pain
but when he let loose that great voice from his chest and the words came piling on like a driving winter blizzard — then no man alive could rival odysseus!
and no force in the world can stop evander now
i will say it outright
filled with anger zeus who marshals the storm clouds answered her at last: disaster
so many sons he slaughtered, just coming into bloom
with that challenge entellus stripped his pleated cloak from his shoulders, baring his great sinewy limbs, his great bones and joints, and stood gigantic in the center of the ring
perhaps they never crossed over from lacedaemon's lovely hills or come they did, sailing here in the deep-sea ships, but now they refuse to join the men in battle, dreading the scorn, the curses hurled at me
then the almighty father, power that rules the world, begins, and as he speaks the lofty house of the gods falls silent, earth rocks to its roots, the heights of the sky are hushed and the western breezes drop and the ocean calms its waters into peace: so then, take what i say to heart and stamp it in your minds
but now i see the soldier facing unequal odds, his day of doom, his enemy’s blows approaching
beaten twice in major battles, our city walls can scarcely harbor italy’s future hopes
now he’s buckled his breastplate, gleaming, ruddy bronze with its bristling metal scales—encased his legs in gold, his temples still bare, but his sword was strapped to his side as down from the city heights he speeds in a flash of gold in all his glory, in all his hopes already locked fast with the enemy—wild as a stallion bolting the paddock, burst free of the reins at last he commands the open plain, making for pasture, out for the herds of mares or keen for a plunge in the river runs he knows so well, he charges off, his proud head flung back, neighing, racing on, reveling in himself, his mane sporting over his neck and shoulders
but a god checked my anger, he warned me of what the whole realm would say, the loose talk of the people, rough slurs of men — they must not call me a father-killer, our achaeans!
if only fortune crowns your proposal with success!
rearing to full height, sword high, the steel hacks the brows, splitting the temples— gruesome wound—and it cleaves the soft unshaven cheeks
the dark branches, the heft of the plunder, all weigh down euryalus—fear leads him astray in the tangled paths
the ones marked out by the rascal we just killed
he used to graze his shambling herds in percote, long ago when the enemy's forces stood far off but once the rolling ships of achaea swept ashore, home he came to troy where he shone among the trojans, living close to priam, who prized him like his sons
dardanus, first and founding father of ilium, came to the land of troy
then away in his ship's stern odysseus stowed the bloody gear of dolon, in pledge of the gift they would sworn to give athena
there she fell in with sleep, twin brother of death, clung to his hand and urged him, called his name: sleep, master of all gods and all mortal men, if you ever listened to me in the old days, do what i ask you now — and you shall have my everlasting thanks
here’s the reply the phrygians, twice enslaved, return to you rutulians!
go back and tell him all, all i say — out in the open too — so other achaeans can wheel on him in anger if he still hopes — who knows?
or if the light of life has left you, where’s my hector now?
no other man would drink the shining wine from its glowing depths, nor would achilles pour the wine to any other god, none but father zeus
i’ve stained your name, my son, with my own crimes, detested, drummed from my fathers’ scepter and their throne!
artemis, flashing her golden reins, cut her down in anger
flashing hector's far in the lead, wild to drag it off, furious to lop the head from its soft, tender neck and stake it high on the city's palisade
still senseless after they propped him in their corner, and they had to fetch the two-eared cup themselves
i was the first trojan, first of the famous allies to spear patroclus down in the last rough charge
one, they say, is called the gate of horn and it offers easy passage to all true shades
ajax rose in fury to trade him taunt for taunt, and now the two of them might have come to blows if achilles himself had not stood up to calm them: enough!
as latinus ended, ilioneus followed: king, great son of faunus, no black gales, no stormy seas have swept us here to your country, nor did the stars or landmarks throw us far off course
so he pressed the point, then took his seat
no, your son, believe me— since anguish is gnawing at you, i will tell you more, unrolling the scroll of fate to reveal its darkest secrets
but you — with enemy war cries ringing in your ears — you lacked the nerve to go up against great ajax, that fierce heart, to look him straight in the eye and fight the man head-on — he's a better man than you!
around them flocked a retinue, crowds of trojans and trojan women, their hair unbound in the mourners’ way
here the elders slaughtered rams, then sat to dine at an endless line of trestles
and groaning deeply the matchless runner answered, o dear mother, true!
then the burnished greaves of electrum, smelted gold, the spear and the shield, the workmanship of the shield, no words can tell its power
laughing, ready with his reply, the prince mocks the prophet: so, a fleet’s sailed into the tiber
so we made our way back home, hearts smoldering, furious for the sum he swore but never paid — and that, that is the one whose men you favor now
let it graze a man — my weapon works in a flash and drops him dead
so achilles wept as he burned his dear friend's bones, dragging himself around the pyre, choked with sobs
say that trojans and argives both agreed to swear a truce, to seal their oaths in blood, and opposing sides were tallied out in full: count one by one the trojans who live in troy but count our achaeans out by ten-man squads and each squad pick a trojan to pour its wine — many achaean tens would lack their steward then!
but then, when the tenth night came on me, black as pitch, i burst the doors of the chamber bolted tight and out i rushed, i leapt the walls at a bound, giving the slip to guards and women servants
but i would escort you with all the kindness in my heart, all the way till i reached the shining hills of argos bound in a scudding ship or pacing you on foot — and no marauder on earth, scorning your escort, would dare attack you then
but you, euryalus, you who outstrip me by a year, i admire you, i receive you with all my heart, through thick and thin embrace you as my comrade
pity me in my own right, remember your own father!
the old horseman peleus urging his son achilles, 'now always be the best, my boy, the bravest, and hold your head up high above the others
turning over the work to you alone
but the trojans—no exceptions, hallowed tree that it was— chopped down its trunk to clear the spot for combat
then aeneas was truly overwhelmed by the vision, stunned, his hackles bristle with fear, his voice chokes in his throat
but if they have followed the oracles laid down by the gods on high and the great shades below, how can anyone overturn your edicts now and plant the fates anew?
now they would have attacked with swords, close-up, incensed, but the two aeantes drove a wedge between them, plowing through the press at their comrade's call
so ajax slowly drew back from the trojans, spirits dashed, and much against his will, fearing the worst for achaea's waiting ships
all adrift till one steady, decisive blast comes down from zeus — so the old man thrashed things out, torn two ways, to join his argives fast with chariot-teams or go and find agamemnon lord of armies
i hosted them, treated them warmly in my halls and learned the ways of both, their strategies, their traits
with that, he crowns his brows with laurel leaves and declares acestes first, the winner over all
he towers over the argives, his head, his massive shoulders!
he found him beside his black ship and shelter, stretched on a fleecy bed, his blazoned gear at hand, his shield and two long spears and burnished helmet
under the mountain ridges stood an immense mound of earth, hedged with shady ilex, the tomb of dercennus, an old laurentine king
these are the solemn honors owed the dead
oh i am swept by the furies, gales of fire!
you are a good soldier
never again will i embrace him striding home through the doors of peleus' house
at his departure he gave me a splendid quiver bristling lycian arrows, a battle-cape shot through with golden mesh, and a pair of gilded reins my son, pallas, now makes his
you will maim your team, you will smash your car to pieces
they gave applause to hector's ruinous tactics, none to polydamas, who gave them sound advice
ajax, idomeneus, trusty odysseus or you, achilles, you — the most violent man alive — so you can perform the rites for us and calm the god yourself
as the argive spun in retreat his shield-rim tripped him — down to his feet that shield he bore to keep off spears — he stumbled over it now, pitched back, helmet clanging harshly against his brows as the man hit the ground
here, on first returning to earth, he hallowed to you, apollo, the oars of his rowing wings and here he built your grand, imposing temple
but if i were now the man i was, full of the youth that spurs that bantam there, cocksure and strutting so— i’d need no bribe of a prize bull to bring me out
the locrians stranded out on libya’s coast?
but if your hands will rear it up, into your city, then all asia in arms can invade greece, can launch an all-out war right up to the walls of pelops
hearing his wish, the lord of men agamemnon dismissed the troops at once to the balanced ships
nor did the other chariot-drivers hold formation — all dismounted, seeing shining hector leap to earth
now a trusted herald, no empty rumor, wings the news to aeneas: his men stand on the razor edge of death— now is the time to rescue his routed trojans
back to the city hector sent two heralds now to bring the lambs at once and summon priam while king agamemnon sent talthybius off, heading down to the ships for one more lamb
summer has just begun when father commands us: hoist our sails to fate!
even if we can breach the argives' gates and wall, assaulting in force, and the argives give ground, back from the ships we will come, back the way we went but our battle-order ruined, whole battalions of trojans left behind and killed — the achaeans will cut us down with bronze to save their fleet!
but i tell you this, and there's anger in my threat: if ever — against my will and athena queen of armies, hera and hermes, and the god of fire hephaestus — if zeus ever spares the towering heights of troy, if he ever refuses to take her walls by force and give the argive troops resounding triumph, let zeus know this full well — the breach between us both will never heal!
swift as a golden eagle seizes a snake and towers into the sky, talons knotted round it, claws clutching fast but the wounded serpent writhes in its rippling coils, stiffens, scales bristling, hissing through its fangs as it rears its head, but all the more the eagle keeps on digging into its struggling victim, its hooked beak ripping away, its wings thrashing the air—so tarchon sweeps his kill right from the tiber’s columns, tarchon flushed with triumph
but zeus woke up, furious, flinging immortal gods about his house to hunt for me — i was the culprit, the worst of all — and out of the skies he would have sunk me in the sea, wiped me from sight, if the night had failed to save me, old night that can overpower all gods and mortal men
think how a lion, mauling the soft weak young of a running deer, clamped in his massive jaws, cracks their backbones with a snap — he's stormed in, invading the lair to tear their tender hearts out and the mother doe, even if she's close by, what can she do to save her fawns?
what course to set to master these ordeals?
they had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof
that is well; you have wished to release the people from royalty, and you deliver over your daughters to the police
these women, too, were pure once
this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it
neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and bedizened embassy
behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the dense obscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him
what are all these fates, driven on pell-mell?
in the meantime, cosette was trembling
at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they seem twenty
just look at that, the villain!
hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard-of occurrences
i order that this woman shall be set at liberty
the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere
there will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men
a very happy personage in the year of grace number, was the noble gentleman robert d’estouteville, chevalier, sieur de beyne, baron d’ivry and saint andry en la marche, counsellor and chamberlain to the king, and guard of the provostship of paris
to have the chairs carried off!
the grave-digger turned green
and the very idea of being nothing!
all that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course

he was, in the full force of the term, what is called in venery a knowing dog
she felt something as though she were beside the good god
she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or dangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved
as he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees
is a fiat lux
all at once, from the depths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, since no one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking, shouted:-who goes there?
in the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall see
genuflection before the idol or before money wastes away the muscles which walk and the will which advances
thereupon, tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously, and blachevelle exclaimed, that is an idea
the candle was nearing its end
social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great
his nature was thus constituted
she gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly
abominations which are not even written in french!
the smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing
the throng of vagabonds, uttering loud acclamations, crowded to its foot to ascend
each became permeated with the other, they were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other
should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall?
thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of the cabaret of the sergeant of waterloo
i might let that to you, for what matters it to me?
very well, said marius, then i will go elsewhere
you ask me to give you three days in which to run away!
the slashers have finished; it was the turn of the thinkers
the first monuments were simple masses of rock, which the iron had not touched, as moses says
two minutes later he was in the rue saint-louis
then terror restored her strength
there was not a single light
in front of him there was another wall, a wall like night
there, i am telling the truth; you have only to ask
he stared at jean valjean
at the first glance, one saw that it was divided into many masses, singularly distinct
exclaimed bérangère, whose eyes, incessantly in motion, had suddenly been raised to the summit of the towers of notre-dame, who is that black man up yonder?
i entreat you, said marius
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
wretch that i am to have gone out that day!
i am the devil, but that's all the same to me
he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow
he overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolved battles with cannon
you belong to us
the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown
she was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs
another day he spoke to the porter
she uttered a feeble cry
the sun was shining bright, and it was not cold
she was his sister, no doubt
yes, since we are now in the month of may
and he flung away the hammer in a rage

only, courfeyrac was an honorable fellow
the neighbor was a singular-looking individual
they had then reached the first hours of that spartan day of the numberth of june when, in the barricade saint-merry, jeanne, surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread, replied to all combatants crying: something to eat!
the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety
an irresistible fascination took possession of her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias all bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof, and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to herself that she must know what it contained
you do not belong in town, sir?
but i have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or to save my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an infamous and venerable convict; it is i, it is always i and nothing but i: but, good god!
what a pack of boobies!
he grumbled:-well, since there is no other means
still, he asked her one or two questions
he laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair to the fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper
gringoire had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed spain and catalonia, even to sicily; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of algiers, a country situated in achaia, which country adjoins, on one side albania and greece; on the other, the sicilian sea, which is the road to constantinople
but whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, half plunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence of thenardier's wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man remained impassive; and marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the superbly melancholy visage
the tall, light-haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious maidens had no mind to let slip their prize

its beauty and simplicity consist in the interspacing of both, being a foot or more wide, which are interlaced, interlocked, fitted together, enchained enchased, interlined one upon another, and bite into each other in a manner that is truly firm and graceful
a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat
these are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy
at the moment when he passed close to this species of spider with a human countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: _la buona mancia, signor!
while they were binding javert, a man standing on the threshold was surveying him with singular attention
in a few minutes the sentence was drawn up
an amour for him; passion for her
the charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by jondrette in the rue pierre-lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat
at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius, a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it
here he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take back his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes in turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly grasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it: oh!
the rascal, he murmured

at the very next visit of the archbishop, the prioress told the story to his grace, half by way of a confession, half by way of a boast
at a brisk trot all the way, and he’ll do it in under eight hours
as for him, he lived in the sort of porter’s lodge at the back of the yard, with a mattress on a bed of webbing, a pinewood table, two straw-bottomed chairs, an earthenware water pitcher, a few books on a board, his precious suitcase in a corner, never a fire
the first man was saying, low but distinctly: let’s beat it
at last the convict raised his eyes to the heavens and took a step forward
it was a ghastly dump, but she felt free
it teaches us something at the same time
the grand sewer, aligned following the riverbed of the ménilmontant valley, is almost two leagues long
but i will have enjoyed myself
from that blessed and sacred moment when a kiss sealed the betrothal of these two souls, marius went there every evening
i am with you
pay for these poor people, give them the extra five francs and don’t say it’s from me
he accompanied napoléon to the island of elba
as he was in the depths of this reverie, his old servant basque came in and asked him:
it was the money they wanted
what’s wonderful, too, is the ease with which people spout hot air
the porter went no further than waking up basque
perils of another kind, no less great, were perhaps awaiting them
there were still no stars in the sky
it is hard to imagine all the perseverance and effort required to bring this cloaca to the point of relative perfection it has now attained
no doubt about it, the man was an enigma
i’ll be a lady
no one corrupts me
she was sad with an obscure sadness that baffled even the woman herself
you will recall that he had carried off the candlesticks when he escaped from montreuil-sur-mer
you’ve noticed your overcoat?
since then, nine months have gone by, at fifteen francs a month, the agreed fee, that comes to a hundred and thirty-five francs
the iron duke remained calm, but his lips were white
and so she reserved her decision on that score
the obscurities a revelation may contain
there is, i believe, a small suitcase to which you are attached; i’ve selected a place of honour for it
marius atop the barricade, following in the octogenarian’s footsteps, was a vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old
the poor boys were starving, gavroche included
the bishop was sitting next to him and he gently touched his hand
you will see from afar, from below, other men working; it will look to you like they are resting
the embankment was deserted and cut-off, there was no one going by; not even a boatman or a longshoreman on the barges moored here and there
vvhat prosecution of meaning is thus hidden behind the prosecution of sound?
what are you talking about?
that same day, or, more precisely, that same evening, as marius had just left the table and retired to his office to study a case file, basque had handed him a letter, saying: the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber
i don’t know what i can do—
he reckoned he’d be at the tillac d’argent tonight
it was even beating a little less feebly as if the motion of the carriage had produced a certain return to life
it’s not hard to understand
on the part of any traveller who had eaten a slice of lamb and drunk two bottles of wine at supper and who did not look like a frightful pauper, such a wish would have been a command
this cloistered existence, so austere and so mournful, a few features of which we have just outlined, is not life, for it is not liberty; it is not the grave, for it is not fullness; it is a strange place from which you see, as though you were on a high mountaintop, the abyss where we are on one side and, on the other, the abyss where we will be; it is a thin and hazy border dividing two worlds, at once illuminated and obscured by both, where the feeble light of life mingles with the dim light of death; it is the half-light of the grave
and since you showed no mercy in getting yourself killed like this, i won’t even feel any grief at your death, do you hear, you assassin!
if the provocation of denying the nazi extermination camps has resisted attack and is even gaining ground, this is because it is synchronous with this spirit of the times, a spirit of resentment, ressentiment: not just resentment of the ideals of the new man which people believed in, or resentment of the people who got you to believe in those ideals or the people who destroyed them and brought about the general loss of faith
no one loves daylight more than the blind
since you got me the job of gardener here!
the young girl had swiftly pulled her dress down in a divinely demure, indeed horrified, movement, but he was no less outraged
the good man took off his redingote and wrapped cosette up in it
he headed toward les halles
it was like a break in the clouds, but then the clouds would turn black again
the fixed stare all the combatants had pinned on the end of the street turned savage
four walls washed with lime, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows, on the door a great wooden crucifix, above the crucifix a square window stuffed with a bale of hay, in a corner, on the ground, an old glazed windowframe all broken—that is the chapel for you
meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate
the stranger surmised that this room communicated with that of the thénardier couple
it would mean risking the lives of three or four poor gendarmes for no purpose
but the counsel for the prosecution needed a jean valjean and, not having champmathieu anymore, latched onto madeleine
mother saint mechthilde, in charge of singing and the choir, was only too happy to use the boarders
i know chateaubriand very well
the barber wheeled around with a look of fury on his face and, without letting go of his razor, shoved the elder boy back with his left hand and the little one with his knee, pushing them out into the street; then he shut his door in a huff: letting in the cold for nothing!
monsieur gillenormand had inherited it from a ferocious great-aunt on his mother’s side who was a hundred when she died
and with health, a kind of bitter harshness toward his grandfather returned
old gillenormand said to himself
all the women who are cooks in the croix-rougenumber turn to me
meanwhile gavroche, who had madly retraced his steps, stopped five or six streets away and sat down panting on the curbstone at the corner of the enfants rouges
it is this danger, imminent in europe perhaps at the end of the eighteenth century, that was short-circuited by the french revolution, that immense act of probity
i suppose you think you’ll be very happy in your abominable rue de l’homme-armé
on those days, jean valjean would return home in a very thoughtful mood
on the other, he would say, that other lot are irredeemably lost
she watched them, but with a calm and savage air
icicaille est le théâtre
he said to himself: there is perhaps a glimmer of life in there yet; i’m going to risk my own existence for that miserable spark!
the cuirassiers did not have time to pause for breath
he took another few steps and then stopped short: wake up to yourself!
toward one o’clock in the morning, the night being pitch black, he saw on the roof, in the rain and howling wind, two shadows flit past the dormer window opposite his cage
as night fell, marius was walking along the same path as the day before with the same rapturous thoughts in his heart, when he saw, through the trees on the boulevard, éponine coming toward him
a rapid dialogue broke out between him and the man with the cudgel, the skinny one
without counting all the heartaches
in his heyday, bonaparte had come across this in italy and defeated it superbly
in the twilight, marius could just make out their livid faces, their thin matted hair, their awful bonnets, their tattered skirts and bare feet
thénardier was a statesman
yet later it was recalled that one of the warders had said: it’d be better only letting him have a wooden dowel
the collar shackles were square
it was getting on his nerves
a sign, in a word, of some prodigious and imminent eruption, if nothing intervenes in the meantime
in a very short while you realized you saw nothing
i prefer the baby you gave me by far
monsieur gillenormand noticed that since he had been brought home to him and since he had regained consciousness, marius had not once called him father—though he did not show that he noticed this
no, he said, they’re after me, they would simply arrest me in her room and that would upset her
monsieur gillenormand, as cosette’s surrogate guardian, had stood in for him
my brother bought it in the days when he was in germany, at tottlingen, near the source of the danube, along with the little ivory-handled knife i use at table
and he placed on the table the packet that aunt gillenormand had mistaken for a book
he placed his hand on the doorknob, the spring bolt yielded, the door cracked open, jean valjean opened it just wide enough to squeeze through, remained motionless for a second, then shut the door again and turned back to face marius
would you have a cabriolet i could hire?
and after the bog, what about the police patrol?
now he’s satisfied, he’ll let me alone, he’s got his jean valjean!
how sad the soul when it is sad out of love!
a cloud passed over marius’s forehead
to whom was this addressed?
after chanting, bell ringing, chime ringing, the knells, the services, the noise of little girls would suddenly burst out, sweeter than the humming of bees
look, those who have families need to be good boys and just shake our hands and go, and let us do what has to be done here on our own
the revolution of number had satisfied him and calmed him down and so had helped on this score
at  chekov street, a man slices open a pig he has killed and cuts it up
a very young girl was standing in the half-open doorway
what your bourgeoise who are starting out, as they say, dream of: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, rosewood and calico
jean valjean, for his part, seemed to have only one thought
the author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, at about twenty miles from brussels, a slice of the middle ages within everyone’s reach, at the abbey of villers, the hole of the oubliettesnumber in the middle of the meadow that was the cloister courtyard, and, on the banks of the dyle, four solitary stone cells, half-underground, half-underwater
these mail coaches were two-wheeled cabriolets upholstered inside in tawny buckskin; they were suspended on pump-springs and had just two seats—one for the postman, the other for the traveller
for there are some things that cause dead women to open their eyes in their graves
the bel-air was lit by a wall lamp
marius did not understand and made the mistake of falling for it
she would stumble across them in the street, she would stumble into them again on her stairs
every newcomer who entered the greasy spoon said when they saw mother thénardier: there’s the master of the house; she’s the one who wears the trousers
you don’t leave your friends in the lurch, snapped montparnasse
what do you want me to say?
from the outside the front of the barricade, composed of piles of cobblestones and barrels held together by beams and boards that interlocked with the wheels of anceau’s cart and the overturned omnibus, looked hideously tangled and impossible to get out of
you’ve seen my key, now show me your money
have you come to say you’re sorry?
one step in the garden and we’ve had it
monsieur mabeuf had innocent pleasures
the moment he had gone, mother thénardier took advantage of his absence to swiftly give cosette a nasty kick under the table, which caused the little girl to howl
this battle-scarred hero was afraid of the old maid
a moment ago, when they told us to come over, i thought i was going to die again, but this time of joy
then you’ll only have me to deal with
but how excusable he finds them, even while standing up to them!
this pitiless century, the twentieth
it sounded like musket shots and the clamour of a big crowd
but you have time—where do you live?
a real hussar, all right!
you do more than that, you slander yourself while you’re pretending to unmask yourself
v the horizon expands
half a century ago, in ordinary everyday parlance, which is entirely made up of traditions and which persists in calling the institut, les quatre nations, and the opéra-comique, feydeau, the precise point jean valjean had come to was called the petit-picpus
meanwhile cosette remained immured in her apparent insouciance and her imperturbable tranquillity—so much so that jean valjean came to this conclusion: this noodle is madly in love with cosette, but cosette doesn’t even know he exists
what had happened in those ten months?
was he to continue to keep quiet?
i raised this child, you see
you’ll see that i’m worth your while
four men swiftly leaped into a small boat
'the screen answers your every whim, in advance', as orwell put it
it had a feel of rubbish about to be swept out of the way and a feel of a royal majesty about to be decapitated
these lines, in the latin of the sixth century, raise the question of whether the two robbers of calvary were called dismas and gestas,number as is commonly thought, or dismas and gesmas
the day she went back to the luxembourg, marius was no longer there
the bishop came forward
but fauchelevent was racing too fast toward the episode’s denouement to notice this sad side to his triumph
old man thénardier in particular was a challenge for the physiognomist
that letter comes from the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie and i’m going back there now
these four streets surrounded this area like a moat
when you entered by the north end, you had the four dormer windows on your left, and on your right, facing the dormer windows, four good-sized square cages, spaced apart and separated by narrow passageways, built out of masonry to elbow height and the rest out of iron bars right up to the roof
but the young man had taken less time to go down than the octogenarian to climb up, and when old man gillenormand stepped into the attic room, marius was no longer there
cherubino does better than rothschildnumber
bric-a-brac from attics and dustbins can take the place of the painter's colours in an abstract’ kind of painting that immediately becomes history painting – as radicalized genre painting
a tad rebellious deep within, though unflapable without, she had said to herself: my father has settled the question of the marriage without me; i will settle the question of the inheritance without him
she felt vaguely that she was on the brink of tumbling into destitution, of sliding down skid row
the wigmaker ran to the broken window and saw gavroche running away as fast as his legs would carry him toward the saint-jean market
marius had flown out of the barricade
to hang off mummy or daddy’s necknumber
what are you doing here, father madeleine?
jean valjean had left the garden wild so that it would not attract attention
marius, we must insist, was standing in the shadow of those great dark wings that flap open over any soul at death’s door
if you only knew, monsieur pontmercy, her beautiful rosy cheeks, they were my joy in life: whenever i saw her a bit pale, i was sad
babet added, sticking to the classic wisecracking slang poulailler and cartouchenumber used to speak, and which is to the bold, new, coloured, and risqué slang brujon used what the language of racine is to the language of andré chénier:number your barkeep must’ve been caught in the act on the stairs
he watched all the dressing operations, while mademoiselle gillenormand absented herself for modesty’s sake
it is the awakening of something radiant and new
here she broke off to wipe her glasses
the barricade has two saviours: marius pontmercy and you
champmathieu more and more amazed
her very babble was conversation
jean valjean pulled a knife out of his fob pocket and flicked it open
he found the key, opened the cupboard, and thrust his arm in without looking and without taking his startled eyes off the fragment of cloth thénardier held up
i the year number
a priest and a good man!
the supreme moment had arrived
this philosophy has been dragged from the depths and unearthed by specialists in the field
my romantic little goatee!
i’ll stay downstairs, answered jean valjean
ah, they do such nice things, don’t they, your friends!
among the idle, there are those who are bores, those who are bored, daydreamers, and a few jokers
find out for me
said the old gentleman, alarmed
monsieur can’t set off again before tomorrow
he lowered his voice further still: put this on the fire
he rose to his feet, hesitated a moment longer and listened; all was quiet in the house, so he headed straight for the window, which he could make out, taking small careful steps
be afraid of ourselves
no one was seen to speak in this crowd, and yet a deep muffled hum was coming from it
a moment later she went on: is she still there?
she had gone away knowing that, which meant she liked the idea of his dying
in the peculiar manner of the berlin school's gest al theorie, kan- dinsky would tirelessly pursue 'the right form': a pictorial language 'that everyone can understand'
it is the effect of a galloping carriage that suddenly comes to a halt
her eyes were red
nature had made her a mere sheep; religion had made her an angel
the young man looked him steadily in the eye and asked him: why’s that?
all the feelings and all the recollections you would imagine him to have had evaporated
the door opened again, the man reappeared; he was carrying in both hands the fabulous doll we mentioned and that the village kids had been ogling since morning, and he stood it before cosette, saying: here, this is for you
then he made one last deperate bid
there were ripples in the grass like souls departing
and with it, a whole european system fell apart
the section does not have any weapons
there were no more tears in his eyes, but a sort of tragic fire
it had the woeful look of all constructions built by hate: it was a ruin
if marius had been courfeyrac, that is, one of those people who laugh at every occasion life throws up, he’d have burst out laughing when his eye lit on mother jondrette
the english barricaded themselves in there; the french got in but could not maintain their position
i don’t like it, but it makes you light in the head
the way marius behaved was no longer at all natural
these sorts of details, particularly in this day and age, might give the bishop of digne a certain pantheist profile, to use an expression currently in vogue, and promote the idea, either to his debit or his credit, that he had one of those personal philosophies peculiar to the age that sometimes take root in solitary souls and build and grow there until they replace religion
at intervals we see truth, that sunshine of the human soul, glimmering away there
cried the old man
marius went slightly red and replied: it means that i’m my father’s son
you’re satisfied with succeeding—what mediocrity!
gueulemer and brujon were in the same dormitory
this house was a prison, too, and looked horribly like the other abode he had fled, and yet he had never imagined anything remotely like it
it’s an extraordinary secret, i tell you
the young were in the process of shedding their skins, if you’ll forgive the expression
marius signalled the driver to stop and shouted at him: by the hour!
he thought he’d caught a few words once at the luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sure
i couldn’t care less
do you stick those little iron things in the little rings to lock them properly?
how many times had he got back up covered in blood, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in his heart, serenity in his soul!
he eluded all eyes, from all sides, as we have just explained
little things that are enormous in the void
marius’s failing fingers had nearly let go of the pistol
the man who breaks out, we repeat, is a man inspired; there is starlight and lightning in the mysterious glow of flight; the straining after deliverance is no less amazing than the flapping after the sublime; and we say of a thief who got away: how did he manage to scale that roof?
jean valjean was in fact properly fitted out; he had the leather knee pad and the bell; he was now officially accepted
that lasted nine years and one month
in those streets, single files of solitary lanterns could be seen stretching away in thinning numbers
he pushed the door
… the future of nations is taking shape in our obscure ranks
in those days, a moustache was the mark of a man about town and spurs signified a pedestrian
mademoiselle baptistine’s dress was cut along the lines of number models, with a short waist, narrow skirt, sleeves with padded shoulders, and with plackets and buttons
i’m in the habit of being polite to everyone
he lived there alone—how, we have just seen
jean valjean killed the police officer javert; he shot him with a pistol
he was an authority because he was an authority
why on earth did we call him marius!
the lascivious and vigorous vegetation quivered, full of sap and euphoria, around these two innocents, and they spoke words of love that made the trees shiver
on the wall, an old map of france under the republic was nailed up—enough of a clue for any passing police officer to smell a rat
you recognized me without too much trouble, he muttered
his eyes were dead; the light had gone out
it would be a mistake to think you can walk around like this, on your own, in uninhabited areas of paris, without meeting with some adventure
he had a long life and a magnificent death!
the iron supports for the right wall are in the form of a cross
she lifted up the stone, which was sizeable
as a domestic group, they were admirable
she’s waiting for me there, he said
to wipe out abuse is not enough; you have to change people’s whole outlook
and, hugged tight in cosette’s arms, he cried: it’s you!
inspector javert, he said, you’ve got me
if it is the rule to go barefoot, all go barefoot
only juvenal and tacitusnumber grumble about it
that i was mad
cosette, standing next to him, was watching the clouds turn pink
just imagine the effect
would it have changed anything that had happened?
divorce was abolishednumber high schools were called colleges
the place is teeming with heaps of unknown beings, the strangest specimens from the stevedore of la rapée to the knacker of montfaucon
i believe it’s true and i feel it’s true
what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true
with the same sack on the back, the same cord around the waist
yet he seemed determined not to ask directions from any passersby
he made their chat last even longer than usual
until that moment, javert had stood stock-still, his eye boring a hole in the ground, all wrong in the middle of this scene like a misplaced statue waiting to be put in the right spot
his wife, mother hucheloup, was an uncommonly ugly bearded woman
the abbé of la trappe goes through horace’s lines with himnumber
in an instant the fourteen hundred dragoons were down to no more than eight hundred; fuller, their lieutenant colonel, fell, dead
see, sister, let’s play with it
we could not pass by this extraordinary house, unknown and dark as it is, without going in and letting in the souls accompanying us on our journey and listening to us narrate, for the good of a few perhaps, the melancholy story of jean valjean
a pretty girl doesn’t cure a fever
and my stain, i’d have given you your share of it every day!
sylvae sint consule dignae!number
i did slip up, i did catch myself in the wrong
he took the left
but it was lost in all these lamentable performances and jondrette’s trumpeting
like all great artists, thénardier was not satisfied
the morning of that very day, being the only one up and about in the house and taking a stroll in the garden before cosette’s shutters opened, he had suddenly spotted this line carved into the wall, probably with a nail: number, rue de la verrerie
(that’s how i am; i do my job; the rest is not my affair)
to dare—progress comes at this price
the husband got up, took the lamp, and went and opened the door
we gave him permission to do so, with the consent of monsieur, the counsel for the prosecution, and the accused’s defence counsel
but you try and give me any revolution against this little embroidered hankie that smells of patchouli!
and anyway, even when he wasn’t there, he left the key in the door
we were spruce, glossy, iridescent, brushed with gold, all aflutter, dapper, dashing
it is all right, at a pinch, to take the reader into a bridal chamber, but not into a virgin’s bedroom
let the sky fall on her head, let the whole ocean crash over her!
it did not reach the two combatants, absorbed and deafened by each other as they were, their breath mingled in the fray
who knows what they might answer?
their clothes, clean in the days of mother magnon—that had served her as a prospectus in regard to monsieur gillenormand—had turned to tatters
the encyclopaedists, led by diderot, the physiocrats, led by turgot,number the philosophers, led by voltaire, the utopians, led by rousseau, formed four sacred legions
after the fighting, one thing needed to be done in a hurry and that was to bury the bodies
on certain major feast days, particularly on the feast day of saint martha, they were allowed, as a special favour and supreme thrill, to dress up as nuns and to perform the offices and rituals of saint benedict for the entire day
so here it is
it was opened and in it were found two printed dialogues signed lahautière, a song called workers unite, and a tin box full of cartridges
we’d each have our own little corner
all at once, bossuet spotted marius coming up the street toward the barrière and looking a little strange
the first man that comes along is a miserable bastard
apart from a hundred other proofs we need not go back over, four witnesses recognize him, javert, upstanding inspector of police, javert, as well as three of his old companions in ignominy, the convicts brevet, chenildieu, and cochepaille
what he had just done sent a shiver down his spine
the doctor, in a paroxysm of anxiety, remained silent
she felt that the great actor was entering the stage, and wordlessly made herself scarce
javert broke in: monsieur l’inspecteur, to you
only, it wasn’t exactly what gavroche was expecting
come along, said courfeyrac
mademoiselle had gone up to her room most intrigued and had thrown this exclamation mark at the stairs, that’s a bit rich!
put yourself in my place, that’s all i have left
jean valjean had been in direr straits than this
it was clear that the man had let himself in with a key, as though he were at home there
the four planks of the coffin gave off a kind of terrible peace
it seemed to him to be taking either a century or only a second
it was, for him, like the first step of a flight of stairs leading back up to life
i took it off the monkeys
the colonel had been struck down by brain fever three days before
actually, anyone who has seen the misery of men only, has seen nothing, you have to see the misery of women; anyone who has seen the misery of women only, has seen nothing, you have to see the misery of a child
i asked the woman who rents chairs, she told me she didn’t see you anymore
they had their gleaming heads together, touching; for all the world like three heads in the one halo
but the sun did not come out
monsieur pontmercy, said jean valjean, i spent nineteen years in the galleys
then he went back to the house and, driven mad with love, giddy, terrified, wild with pain and worry, like a man who comes home at the wrong moment, he banged on the shutters
at some distance from the bench, well before he had come to the end of the walk, he stopped altogether and, though he himself did not know how it happened, he spun on his heel and turned back
this box had a grille, too, only it was not a grille of gilded wood as at the opéra, it was a monstrous trellis of iron bars hideously enmeshed and fixed to the wall with enormous bolts that looked like clenched fists
on that note, he jammed his cap down over his eyes and turned on his heel
the eye ends up adapting to dingy cellar light
if it had been given to these two young men to step onto the stage of history, one would have played the righteous man, the other would have played the sage
it’s true, i went bust, i’m now in hiding, i don’t have a crust of bread, i don’t have a sou, i’m a crook, all right!
for this devout spinster, myriel was both her brother and her bishop, the friend she grew up with and her superior according to ecclesiastical authority
the noise this made kept her company
he measured the appalling turn his fate had taken without his suspecting it; he recalled his fears of the previous summer, so crazily dispelled; he recognized the edge of the abyss; it was still the same; only jean valjean was no longer on the brink, he was at the bottom
a day without seeing you!
the thing must have dragged on and they’re having an evening session
dogs, dogs are better off!
enjolras had their uniforms put to one side
youth was a bouquet; every young man ended in a branch of lilac or a bunch of roses; even if you were a warrior, you were a shepherd; and if, by chance, you were a captain of dragoons, you’d find a way of being called floriannumber we were keen to be pretty, we embellished ourselves, we decked ourselves out in crimson
he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that wonderful march in echelon under enemy fire
no one any longer remembered the role that each one might be assigned to play; the counsel for the prosecution forgot he was there to prosecute, the presiding judge that he was there to preside, the defence counsel that he was there to defend
the degree of civilization is measured by the degree of imagination
mother thénardier ditched the last two, while they were still very young and little, through a singular stroke of luck
they are all, every one of them, rogues, cutthroats, red caps, thieves!number every one of them, i tell you!
the bishop said grace, then himself served the soup as was his wont
was there any harm in waiting?
he overwhelmed the weak point with grapeshot; he set battles up and dissolved them with cannons
monsieur le duc d’havré,number as captain of the guards on duty that day, was sitting in the carriage opposite the king
he was on the battlefield of waterloo
the pain he felt was beyond endurance
at that point, by the roadside to the right, was an inn with a four-wheel cart outside the door, along with a great bundle of hop poles, a plow, a pile of dry brushwood near a quickset hedge, some lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder lying along an old shed with straw walls
he wheeled round; the open hand had closed again, seizing the lapel of his greatcoat
if i were a pretty woman i’d make myself a present of that piece, there
those filled with light weep, if only over those filled with darkness
in this one, there was no fire, there were no ashes, even; but what there was attracted the traveller’s attention
i a group that nearly became history
monsieur leblanc turned round and answered with a smile: i haven’t forgotten it, i’m leaving it
there used to be a little girl who played in the courtyard; the child of the concierge or of one of the women from the workshop
not too bad at all!
jean valjean, unshakable, never set foot in the garden
waving a hammerless—dogless—pistol around in your hand in the middle of the street is such a public service that gavroche felt his verve increasing with each step
she no longer felt she had the strength to say a word in her own defence
a reflection of moonlight made the crucifix above the mantelpiece dimly visible; it seemed to be opening its arms to both of them, in benediction for the one and forgiveness for the other
devastated bodies seemed like so many panicky signs of a live spectacle in which 'the catastrophic intensity condenses a terrifying serenity at the edge of the abyss' - as you could read in the press apropos stuart's most recent work, appetite, conceived with the installation artist, ann hamilton
these heaps of filth piled up by the curbstones on street corners, these cartloads of muck bouncing along the streets at night, these awful cans the night carters trundle along the roadways, these fetid streams of subterranean feculence that the pavement hides from you—do you know what all this is?
the father went on: be humane
the farther she went, the thicker the darkness became
now, he said, i’m off
with the stove hidden, the room was now illuminated by the candle alone and the tiniest object on the table or mantelpiece cast a huge shadow
still, the fact that the fire had been lit again encouraged him
little did the conventionist suspect that he had swept aside, one after the other, all the bishop’s entrenched internal defences
unless you saw them through the garden gate, it would have been hard to guess that they lived in the rue plumet
the lair had been found, now it was just a matter of bagging the game
the lack of tension in the curve of the projectile used in the sixteenth-century rifled cannon was due to the weakness of the charge; weak charges, for this kind of engine of siege warfare, are imposed by the necessities of ballistics, such as, for instance, preserving the gun carriages

only the thénardiers, out of propriety and curiosity, remained in the room
he insisted that no one mention him in front of him again, regretting to himself quietly that he should be so perfectly obeyed
on all the points we have just listed, he had not dared press jean valjean—without admitting to himself that he simply did not dare
i break the rope she has tied around her foot, and she flies away, free
immediately after the release of champmathieu, the counsel for the prosecution shut himself up with the judge
the traveller seemed worried and distracted
stockings for my little girls who don’t have any, none to speak of, and will soon be getting around barefoot
thénardier was haggard, smelly, sleazy, a bit threatening, yet friendly
he was now so weary that every three or four steps he was forced to stop to get his breath and he would lean against the wall
he sat down again and began glancing around in silence; everyone regarded him in perplexity
without saying a word, he turned and headed back in the direction of the haymarket
only then did you calm down; you clutched that junk in your hands day and night; it was impossible to get them away from you
arkady coolly removed his things from the carriage and climbed in next to bazarov
he may eventually become a proper rascal in time, when that nonsense has vanished, but now he’s too eager to live!
i’m talking about justice
one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again
later he recalled that he had started laughing with a nervous, shallow, inaudible, long-lasting laugh, and kept laughing all the while he was crossing the square
everything described here took place almost in a single moment
do you remember how mr razumikhin began letting the cat out of the bag?
we acutely sense in various aspects of his language varying degrees of the presence of the author and of his most recent semantic instantiation
he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase
reprinted by permission of the president and fellows of harvard college
he began, taking from the bundle a rather nice but at the same time very ordinary and inexpensive service cap
i agree that it’s an illness, just like everything else that’s in excess—and it’s essential that it go to excess—but, in the first place, it’s different for everyone, and in the second place, of course, one must maintain moderation, judiciousness, even if it’s base, but what’s to be done?
and he, he—also unseeing and unbelieving—he, too, would hear at once, and he, too, would believe
razumikhin stood there in front of him, dropping his arms, in dark and serious thought
baden-baden, december ,  ( january , )
at that moment, something seemed to pierce his heart; he shuddered and quickly moved away from the window
so, keep this in mind; and now be so kind as to accept, in the interests of your relative, in the first instance, this modest sum from me personally
cried razumikhin with some unusual agitation
svidrigaylov occupied two rather spacious furnished rooms
i will answer point by point
naturally, i considered it an honor to fulfill her request; i tried to pretend to be astounded and embarrassed; in a word, i played my part very well
over here, he replied
you can tell him i insulted all anglomaniacs
katya adored nature, and arkady loved it, although he did not dare admit it; odintseva was fairly indifferent to nature, as was bazarov (viii,  [p ])
she screamed, but the quartermaster, who had lost his balance from the swing, fell clumsily under the table
she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances, so as not to lose her strength
so it is, so it is: i haven’t even removed the loop under my arm!
relates to external cynicism
why have you embraced virtue so wholeheartedly?
and why did lieutenant porokh interrogate me after i fainted?
he also took his cap
i wasn’t that hungry
judging by his voice, he must be very young, raskolnikov reflected suddenly
meanwhile, he still hurried to svidrigaylov’s; did he expect something new from him, a sign or a way out?
suddenly he noticed a cord around her neck; he pulled it, but the cord was strong and didn’t break; besides, it was soaked in blood
he sez, he vil make big satire on me und vil in all ze papers write on me
arkady said in some annoyance
she asked, after waiting a minute
they’re in debt for that apartment; i hear that the landlady just served them notice, but katerina ivanovna says that she herself doesn’t want to stay there a moment longer
this question leads to the following doubt: is not bazarov pretending to himself and to others?
often, sometimes after several days or even weeks of gloomy, morose silence and silent tears, the sick woman became hysterically agitated and suddenly began talking aloud, almost without pausing, about her son, her hopes for him, about his future
how to proceed, ma’am?
¶ court council of war (german)
this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna, or simply lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that very same old woman, alyona ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender, where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test
but why shouldn’t i brag if it’s harmless?
there are no foundations to our society, dostoevsky wrote in his notebook in
oh, i don’t know!
arkady lowered his eyes
what difference does that make?
then he himself hurriedly left the room
as a result of their discomfort, the women sometimes pulled their hands away from the bony grip of his enormous hands
it seemed to raskolnikov that the head clerk had become ruder and more contemptuous of him after his confession, but strange to say—he suddenly felt that no one else’s opinion mattered to him at all, and this change seemed to take place in one single instant
he repeated, thinking in earnest that he had gone mad
all traces have been buried!
i have no sins!
just came to, echoed the stranger again, with a slight smile
they walk with a heavy step, supporting each other; when they approach the railing, they fall on their knees and remain there for a long time, weeping bitterly, gazing attentively at the headstone under which their son lies buried: they exchange a few words, brush the dust off the stone, move a branch of the pine tree, and pray once again; they ca not forsake this place where they seem to feel closer to their son, to their memories of him  can it really be that their prayers and tears are futile?
i’ll take this carriage to yelagin island
she was young and not unattractive—one of the group of women
three silver rubles or two little paper bills,  as that
of course, we’ll have dinner together
do you go often?
if i’d had even a drop of suspicion about you, that’s how i should’ve behaved
you have made me absolutely happy, he said, still smiling broadly
around her long, thin neck, resembling a chicken leg, was draped some sort of flannel rag, and over her shoulders, in spite of the heat, a worn-out, faded fur-trimmed jacket hung loosely
he was lionized by many people, indulged himself, even played the fool, and put on airs; but this too suited him
he’s not sarcastic, not because he lacks wit: it’s just that he has no time for such nonsense
on the contrary, i’m completely well!
the romanticism associated with the image of the youthful revolutionary, and the pedocracy to which it probably gave rise, had something inherently spurious and silly about it
the entrance to their staircase was from the street
by regarding bazarov detachedly as is possible only for a man who is behind the times and not involved in the contemporary movement of ideas; by examining him with the cold, probing gaze which is only engendered by long experience of life, turgenev has justified his hero and valued him at his true worth
everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich, who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg
incidentally, he was remarkably handsome, with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair; he was taller than average, slender, and well built
he too, however, spoke of bazarov as towering over the other characters, and declared that turgenev might claim to be drawn to him by an irresistible attraction, but it would be truer to say that he feared him
and yet i didn’t want to leave it
one of the caretakers asked
zosimov ordered that raskolnikov not be disturbed until he awoke

i’ve come to see you for the last time, raskolnikov continued gloomily, even though this was only his first visit
now what do we do?
here’s what i forgot!
they sat side by side, miserable and dazed, as if they had been cast upon a deserted shore after a storm at sea
luzhin said you were even the cause of a young child’s death

i would sometimes feel so sorry for him!
to pursue a career other than the one their background would normally indicate
what do you care about this stupid triumph over me?
yes, sir, you had a little attack, sir!
he finally establishes himself in an environment where he can live out the traditional forms of the aristocratic life he so treasures
then you should know that i love you, stupidly, madly  now see what you have extracted
may the kingdom of heaven be hers and—enough, old woman, it’s time to rest!
the lodgers were bawling, each doing his own thing—some were discussing, as best they could, what had just occurred; others were quarreling and cursing; still others struck up a song
whenever he encountered them, he always pressed up against his father and trembled
not officially and not me personally, but we were here, sir
can it be that her whole being is concentrated in her brain?
truth alone matters: what cannot be established by observation and experiment is useless or harmful ballast—'romantic rubbish'—
do you believe that i’d fallen in love to such an extent that had she said to me: cut marfa petrovna’s throat or poison her and marry me—it would’ve been done at once!
they began to buy real cream, do you hear?
never, never did i realize this more clearly than i do now; and more than ever do i fail to understand the nature of my crime!
but somehow he still understood some of them; he looked at him quizzically and didn’t know how it would end
her ample white dress hid her completely beneath its gentle folds; her legs were crossed, and the ends of her feet could hardly be seen
wait, where are you going?
he said, leaning over her
i shall try to avoid that
pray for me sometime, too: and thy servant, rodion
in the scene that describes bazarov's death, turgenev's hero falls into delirium, and is possessed by a vision of dogs; he describes this vision to his father: even now i am not quite sure i am expressing myself clearly
that’s what scared him that day at the police office when he fainted
well, go on, speak
he walked for a long time down the long, narrow corridor without finding anyone; he was about to shout when suddenly, in a dark corner, between an old wardrobe and the door, he discerned some strange object, something that seemed alive
i’m in a hurry, i have no time, and i have to leave soon
these passages—like the whole account of bazarov's death—are startling in their elemental power; they are also puzzling: turgenev uses the hero's delirium to represent his dying, in images that both arrest and confound the reader
dunya exclaimed in horror
an amusing old man and very kind, bazarov added as soon as vasily ivanovich had left
but can such minor matters really be inflated by so sonorous a name?
but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms, since theirs served as the passageway
yes, i hate them, i physically hate them
my regards to rodion romanych
sit down, he said suddenly, but in an altered, soft, and polite voice
who among our writers and scholars has not begun with some bizarre first steps?
but you can’t even write properly; the pen’s slipping out of your hand, observed the head clerk, staring at raskolnikov with curiosity
it flew open with a loud noise  he had not expected it to move so easily; besides, his hands were trembling
can it really be that love, sacred, devoted love is not all-powerful?
mumbled raskolnikov, in a barely audible voice
why do i need a whole procession?
i’ve come to see you for two reasons: first, for some time i’ve heard extremely interesting and favorable reports of you, and i wanted to make your acquaintance; second, i hope that perhaps you won’t refuse to assist me in an undertaking that directly concerns the interests of your sister, avdotya romanovna
arkady moved aside, but continued watching her; he did not take his eyes off her all during the quadrille
do you know what?
you’re being foolish, too, sonya: what do we have to eat now, tell me!
these last words were uttered in the entrance hall
it was aleksey semyonovich; he also works in our office
have you read it?
no, the document didn’t constrain me, svidrigaylov continued pensively
i’ll give you some for the journey
no, not at all, it’s even ridiculous in a certain sense
i was sea-bathing in ventnor, a small town on the isle of wight—it was in august of —when i first thought of fathers and sons, that tale thanks to which i lost—
the antiquated man stood there without moving for a few minutes and then slowly made his way home
i know one thing: there was no preconceived idea, no tendentiousness in me then
but what if he had wanted to or it had been part of his plans?
all of a sudden, razumikhin shuddered
similarly, i must deprive myself of the honor of meeting you tomorrow morning, as a result of unavoidable business at the senate, and so as not to interfere with your intimate reunion with your son, and avdotya romanovna’s reunion with her brother
the old nag stretches out her muzzle, gasps for breath, and dies
well, and the chill that ran down your spine?
she whispered rapidly, energetically, quickly glancing at him with her sparkling eyes and firmly grasping his hand in her own
sit down; stay here, begged svidrigaylov
they looked at each other still more fixedly
sonya took a step back from him in fear, as if from a madman
your father plays the cello?
let's see what species of mammalia this person belongs to, bazarov said to arkady the next day as they both climbed the stairs of the hotel where odintsova was staying
the proverbial words that bazarov omits, which arkady refuses to acknowledge, are demonic: devils lurk in still waters [v tikhom omute, cherty vodiatsia]
if sofiya semyonovna doesn’t return in ten minutes, i’ll send her to see you, if you like, even later today
that’s the simplest solution to the problem!

he promised to call in sometime after ten
hegel maintains that at this level any given phenomenon necessarily implies its opposite: complementary abstractions depend on each other for either of them to lay any claim to validity
good-bye, or, rather, till we meet!
i assure you, you won’t be sorry!
if only she’d tell us where to take her, otherwise
pavel petrovich opened his eyes slowly
but he also recalled that there were moments, hours, and even, perhaps, days full of apathy that overwhelmed him, as if in opposition to his previous fear—apathy resembling the painfully indifferent condition of certain people on the edge of death
during the course of the novel arkady learns to appreciate katya's qualities; although initially dazzled by odintsova, he turns to katya first for consolation when her older sister rebuffs him in favor of bazarov; but later arkady comes to love katya and submit to her mode of temporality
lay me back down
perhaps i’ll come here
she jumped back in fright, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak; she stared at him, her eyes open wide
-; and clark butler, g w f hegel (boston, ), pp
he never takes an interest in what interests other people at any given moment
those are my parting words to you!

peter ran off; while he went to fetch the droshky, the two opponents sat on the ground in silence
hey, enough of that, said svidrigaylov, suddenly recovering, i’ve told you
why didn’t you come to work with mitrei the next day?
if you like, with pleasure  i will have to ask nikolai petrovich about
as i have tried to show here, however, the hegelian dialectic has no less relevance for the novel
raskolnikov’s pale face flushed; he seemed to shudder all over; his eyes flashed
¶ a reference to a character in the play the marriage () by nikolai gogol
there were two soup spoons, two bowls, and complete settings: a saltcellar, pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so on, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in quite some time
even afterward, subsequently, when she recalled this moment, she felt strange and full of wonder: why was it that she realized immediately at that time that there was no doubt?
that's the one thing i have changed
by the way, mama, i committed an unforgivable act yesterday; i must have been out of my mind
his serious concerns are positive
seldom has a writer given a better cue to the meaning of his work, and most of all in the comparison between bazarov and pugatchev, the leader of an th century peasant rebellion who was hanged by a tzar
enough of that, arkady repeated after katya
you’re caught at last!
raskolnikov stood still for a long time and watched him go
the lodger opened his eyes, shuddered, and recognized nastasya
frightened, i ran away, and just then i heard the bell announce the train
bazarov would not steal a handkerchief for the same reason that he would not eat a piece of putrid beef
he begged her pitifully
svidrigaylov had arranged for a requiem to be sung punctually twice a day
in the first place, it’s impossible to say it here on the street; secondly, you must also hear what sofiya semyonovna has to say; in the third place, i have some documents to show you
literature has acquired a more mature outlook, and many harmful prejudices have been rooted out and ridiculed
still, we should’ve taken him to the police, added the tradesman
i do not know you well, replied bazarov
he was here, but he’s vanished!
i’ll spend the night here next to

nevertheless, it suggests an idea!
he repeated after them, gathering up his last strength
just because you two had words once, does that mean you won’t come?
toggenburg and all the minnesingers, that is, it deals with the romantic ideal of love as something transcendent, extraordinary, fatal, mysterious, poetic, and infinitely distant from ordinary life
i’ve told you already, i did, i told you
were you also a cardsharp?
pavel petrovich walked to the end of the garden, also grew thoughtful, and also raised his gaze to the sky
it should be only one of us
what do you care about that?
we’ve gone further in our convictions
is not it true, bazarov, he's a sybarite?
she pointed at someone in the crowd
why do you say that?
for no one is so much the ideologue of the romantic and the aesthetic as pavel
entering the courtyard, she turned right, toward the corner where a staircase led up to her apartment
i have heard that countess lambert is dissatisfied with the novel: do not believe it
fenechka asked, taking the heavily bound volume into her hands
but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance, so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first, as if with annoyance, but then it grew stronger and stronger
turgenev is a master of language; he is interested in words in a way that the other great nineteenth-century russian novelists—with the exception of gogol— are not
at last they began to fear pulkheriya aleksandrovna’s strange silence on several points
they hire unreliable people to change banknotes in offices: can you trust perfect strangers with a job like that?

he added with a laugh
put some money away for a rainy day?
why isn’t zametov there?
the term, with due allowance for the changes of a century and of cultures, points to two fundamental aspects of bazarov that underlie both his attractive and repulsive traits for most readers—his immaturity and his position as an outsider in a world he never made

or she wrings her hands, coughs up blood, weeps, and suddenly begins banging her head against the wall, as if in despair
raskolnikov was silent and stared fixedly and decisively at porfiry
for a long time he tried to grasp one but he couldn’t; he was growing tired of his efforts
in what way does he (or she) differ from that other contemporary reader?
but faith in the people seems just as irrational to bazarov as the rest of the 'romantic rubbish
linked to the defeminization of appearance was the unconscious longing to resemble the man, for the distinctive garb of the nihilist girl—short hair, cigarettes, plain garments—were boyish affectations
this is the same as yesterday, cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna bitterly
he was almost beginning to rave; an anxious smile wandered across his lips
a dirty mutt, trembling from the cold, ran across the road in front of him

he fell silent and thought for a long time
anna sergeevna looked at him questioningly
odintseva threw her head back against the back of the chair and crossed her bare forearms on her breast
it wasn’t so much that he understood, but that he clearly felt, with all the strength of his feeling, that not only with his previous sentimental expansiveness, but even with whatever resources he had available, he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the police office, even if instead of their being just police officers, they were all his own brothers and sisters, even then he would have had no reason to communicate with them, not for anything in his life

who says he’s not in control of his faculties?
with trembling hands, pulkheriya aleksandrovna handed him the letter
you seem to have forgotten my sister is both beautiful and clever, and  you in particular, arkady nikolaevich, should not say such things, especially with such a serious expression
why are you here?
give it to me!
he accused herzen and ogaryov of slavophilism in their thinking about the supposed revolutionary potential of the peasantry
the lament of poor, consumptive, bereaved katerina ivanovna seemed to produce a strong effect on the public
asked the man who’d glanced at the paper
she cried with indignation
but what do you mean without hope?
shouts someone from the crowd who’s gotten a taste of the fun
by contrast, turgenev sees communities, large and small, as a threat to an always precarious individuality and sense of identity
he’s a former house serf
and how do i know?
i’m all mixed up; that was then!
if i differ from lowe, it is in seeing this plot not as another endorsement of romantic love, but as quite the opposite
the rude expression of this irony, and a causeless and purposeless harshness in the treatment of others relates to external cynicism
i, too, don’t know how to thank him, continued raskolnikov, suddenly frowning and lowering his head
'what are you complaining about, what are you seeking, what do you ask of life?
it is the lucidity of final self-confrontation, bazarov's lament over his lost, his unused powers: i was needed by russia  no, it's clear, i was not needed  and: i said i should rebel  i rebel, i rebel!
go back to them and stay with them
oh, lord, did he really spend it all on drink?
he was not bored with her, and she offered to repeat yesterday's performance of the sonata; but when at last odintsova returned and he saw her, his heart instantly felt a pang  she was coming through the garden at a somewhat tired pace; her cheeks were red, her eyes shining brighter than usual under her round straw hat
she must have hidden here and not slept the whole night
the second is that of the raznochintsy, literally persons of various classes, a term applied to those members of classes other than the gentry, usually the clergy or the minor and provincial professional and bureaucratic classes, who sought  from ralph e matlaw, turgenev's novels, harvard slavic studies iv ()

i even had the honor of meeting your sister—she’s an educated and charming person
if a man’s a gentleman, he can acquire all the rest through talent, knowledge, intelligence, and genius!
bowing politely to his former traveling companion, he cried, let's go!
it's not for nothing i have always said you were the kindest, smartest man in the whole world; now i see you are as reasonable as you are magnanimous
you don’t believe in god!
i found ’em in the street, and he says this with some uncertainty, without looking at me
she rushed to him and embraced him tightly once more
ilya petrovich replied strangely
yet they couldn’t find general kobelev for someone who was looking for him
he looked around at the worn yellowish wallpaper, at the dust, his couch
it doesn’t mean a thing!
her head was spinning
i didn’t say that; but perhaps you’re also right about that; however
katya made a slight curtsey, took up a position next to her sister, and began sorting the flowers
then he listened again for sounds on the staircase, listening attentively, for a long time
in addition, i can recommend ganot, traité élémentaire de physique expérimentale
that is why bazarov is easily excited, why everything vexes him, everything has an effect on him, despite all his firmness and consistency in words and actions
he recalled his late wife  she did not live to see it!
persecution from the government reached a climax in  when the book version appeared
she stood in the same place, three paces away from the table
you are a proponent of the do- mostroi
and it all works out
muttered raskolnikov at last, not even comprehending the question very well
petr petrovich grew angry
who’s that curly-haired fellow who just looked in here?
somewhere down below, in the depths, visible just beneath his feet, he seemed to see all of his recent past, his previous thoughts, previous problems, previous subjects, previous impressions, this entire panorama, even himself, and everything else, everything
he said with utmost clarity, with the most offensive precision, that the reason for all of it was his miserable condition, his poverty and helplessness, his desire to provide for the first steps in his life’s work with the help, at least, of the three thousand rubles he had counted on finding at the old woman’s apartment
gradually she grew used to him, but was still timid in his presence, when suddenly her mother, arina, died from cholera
i’d have replaced the rock and put it back the same way as it was before, pressed it down with my foot, and then gone away
the creation of such figures as bazarov's mother and father is a real triumph of talent
alive and well and has not changed in the least
(the force of the juxtaposition is vitiated in translation; in the original, fathers is the last word of stanza  and child is the first word of stanza )
it means that i was bored to death with all of you and want to be alone, raskolnikov replied calmly
he repeated, involuntarily enjoying an awareness of his own maturity and freedom
i’ll be even worse!
painstakingly surrounded by flourishes
he was on the same bed, wrapped up as before in the same blanket; the candle was not lit; full daylight was showing through the window
you ought to consult an experienced doctor, and not that chubby fellow you see!
some clerks were sitting and writing in the second room, dressed only a little bit better than he was, and they were all strange-looking
but his heart didn’t stop
well, sir, that’s fine, sir, concluded ilya petrovich
the fact is that the events are not particularly entertaining and that the idea is not startlingly true
to you all the beauties of life, one can say—nihil est, you are an ascetic, a monk, a hermit!
reflexes, it was said, is directed to the corruption of morals: it is indictable as dangerous reading for people without established convictions and as such must be confiscated and destroyed under article  of the penal code
her hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s
they consider raphael a fool because, they say, he's an authority; and they themselves are disgustingly impotent and sterile; their imagination goes no further than girl at the fountain no matter how hard they try!
i thought about that, too
such criticism has long ceased to have any intrinsic value, yet it serves well to define the heavy weight of tradition still bearing down on much of turgenev criticism and scholarship, particularly in the west
replies vehemently to pavel pe-trovich's tirades and does not immediately succeed in gaining control over himself and once more shutting himself up in his derisive coldness
he can say that even though his teeth are still chattering, he-he!
you,  she says, seem bored
for this reason alone rodion was right to drive petr petrovich away earlier!
he shuddered, came to, raised his head, looked out the window, guessed the time, and jumped up, having come to his senses completely, as if someone had torn him away from the sofa
yes, said nikolai petrovich through his teeth
for some reason, raskolnikov didn’t like that at all; he regarded the new paper with hostility, as if regretting that anything had changed
this is your uncle, she repeated, almost whispering
but it was not the trembling of youthful timidity or the sweet fretting over a first declaration of love that overcame him: it was passion struggling within him—powerful and painful—
this is how things have always been and this is how they always will be!
he’s a practical man, hardworking, honest, and capable of loving deeply
look, look: they must be very hungry, the poor fellows!
she was twisting the thin stem of a wildflower in her fingers, her light shawl had slipped down to her elbows, and the broad gray ribbons of her hat were clinging to her chest
after hearin’ all this, i didn’t say nothing to nobody at the time’—that’s dushkin speaking—but i found out everythin’ i could about the murder and went back home with the same worries
what are you talking about?
perhaps he’d even come like that on purpose, to show that he wasn’t afraid of anyone
your sister’s never here?
a moment later he had already forgotten about him, didn’t even see him, even though he was looking right at him
i didn’t ask whether you believe that people see ghosts

anna sergeevna began laughing once again and immediately turned away
in other words, within the hour you’ll hear two reports about him, one from the doctor, do you understand, from the doctor himself
let him go for a walk, get some fresh air
i took this monstrosity along in reserve, and they were able to determine the correct size
i have to attend to some business and, thus, will not interfere, he added with a somewhat offended look and began to rise from his place
whispered fenechka, clasping her hands
the fates of the fathers and sons are strange!
well, find it and you’ll go on living

when mama was coming up the stairs, she even crossed herself out of fear
but no one can keep the upper hand with her for very long, katya added in a low voice
but the left was not unanimous
meanwhile, at the stroke of midnight, svidrigaylov crossed the tuchkov bridge in the direction of the petersburg side
the performance of acts is sometimes masterful, extremely clever, but the control of the acts, their origin, is confused and depends on various morbid impressions
he’s a fine man, my friend, most wonderful
the drawings are clearer in that work, and in general the text's more
‡ an ironic reference to the lofty idealism of the german romantic writer friedrich schiller (–)
he turned to her
she said please,  she wanted them so much
razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university
arkady noticed all this, but kept his opinions to himself
nikolai petrovich exclaimed in despair more than once
they told me so
what’ll you do so that it won’t?
therefore, she must mean something to him!
if someone has a conscience, and if he acknowledges his mistake, then let him suffer
turgenev describes the older kirsanov walking in his garden: 'nikolai petrovich  sorel declares that this passage occurs in a letter which, according to the economist lujo brentano, marx wrote to one of his english friends, professor beesly (réflexions sur la violence, th edn, paris, , p , n )
because she’s gullible and kind; she’s so kind that she believes everything, and
what did you say
does it still haunt you?
i’ll call in at your place one of these days
well then, tell me now, after such a beginning, how could i not be carried away by what followed?
at last tanyusha came in and announced that dinner was served
according to his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward, depending on the individual; then they pass away, as does any illness
aren’t you washing away half your crime by going to accept your suffering?
saying this, she hastened to throw on her cape and put on her hat while dunechka also got dressed
my young artist would have said to his contemporaries of his work: this, my friends, is what a fully developed man must be like!
he listened with pleasure and even felt very much like laughing, and laughing, and laughing
my brother's a man of the old school, hot-tempered and stubborn  thank god it ended the way it did
marmeladov, who didn’t pay any attention to these people, continued his story
he was a very young man, about twenty-two, with a dark complexion and a lively countenance, seemingly older than his years, dressed fashionably like a dandy, his hair parted to the back of his head, well combed and well greased, with a large number of different rings on his white fingers scrubbed clean with a brush, and wearing gold chains on his vest
i suppose they are waiting for me?
you live such an isolated life that you don’t even know things that concern you directly
when, six days later, i brought my first wages home—twenty-three rubles and forty kopecks—when i brought it all home, she called me a sweetie: you’re such a sweetie,  she said!
perhaps, in so doing, he may have contributed unwittingly to the fostering of that 'spiritual pedocracy', as sergey bulgakov called it, which became 'the greatest evil of our society as well as a symptom of intelligentsia heroism
you should pull yourself together
how is it that somehow i wound up at razumikhin’s place?
i don’t know what!
then it began to pour down rain; dunya, insulted and disgraced, had to make the trip, all eleven miles, with a peasant in an open cart
what would’ve happened to us now, dunya, without those three thousand rubles?
is it progressive or reactionary?
a page or two of condillac that very morning; but his methods were different, more up-to-date
drink some beer, more beer!
my purpose will be to suggest the further point that turgenev may be perceived not only as an artist, but in his artistry, as a certain kind of thinker
yes, sir, it’s simpler and understand—
stop it, enough of that; oh, how painful all of this is for me
what business is that of yours?
he even shuddered, since his nerves had been so frayed of late
he stopped in front of her
that entire episode with katerina ivanovna occurred because of sonya
raskolnikov was listening carefully
bazarov cried unwittingly, as he lowered pavel petrovich onto the grass
well, arkady nikolaevich, i see you understand love like all our modern young men: 'here chick, chick!
of course, in my personal opinion, you’re exaggerating the risks, but
in the prison rodion raskolnikov, a second-class convict, has been confined for nine months
let us add in parentheses that to maintain all this is the only way to preserve one’s beauty even in old age
i don’t want you ever to come back!
don’t be upset; i’m not a bore; i got on with cardsharps, i didn’t bore prince svirbey, my distant relative and grandee, i was able to write in mrs prilukova’s album about raphael’s painting of the madonna, i spent seven years with marfa petrovna without leaving the country, i spent nights in vyazemsky’s lodging house on haymarket square in the old days, and perhaps i’ll go up in berg’s hot-air balloon
in that sense, really all of us behave almost in a deranged manner, and extremely frequently, with only the slight difference that the sick’ ones are somewhat more deranged than the rest of us, and therefore it’s essential to draw a distinction
for the most part the friends visit together, in the kirsanov family, in the bazarov family, in the provincial capital, in the village of the widow odintsov
(he stood and picked up his hat)
i have forgiven thee once
put him right on the sofa, with his head over here, raskolnikov said
you’ll come here again?
many of our students have been to see her
he gradually contradicted his patient and, just imagine, they say he achieved results!
yes, said nikolai petrovich
he was becoming extremely absentminded and forgetful, and he knew that himself
this way, this way, to my place!
i heard it myself
anna sergeevna continued farther down the path, her beautiful dress rustling lightly
razumikhin will be with you; i told him
raskolnikov cried in a frenzy
that’s not the point, raskolnikov interrupted with disgust
she came in again at two o’clock with some soup
in a flash, a pillow turned up under the unfortunate man’s head, something no one else had thought of
sonya and polechka ran after her
finally he felt the return of his recent fever and chills, and surmised with pleasure that he could also lie down on the sofa
cried dunechka in a genuine frenzy, completely losing her head
he scalds himself on boiling milk and then tries to cool down someone else's hot water
zosimov struggled and then, after being released, looked closely at razumikhin and suddenly burst out laughing
he trembled with rage
the authorial consciousness, that overarching mind that gives the narrative its form, is touched by a knowledge more bitter than that possessed by either kirsanov or the elder bazarov: the vision of emptiness  or formlessness beyond the barriers of decorum does not belong to them
they say that tsars also visit the dying
but his face was as pale as before
she looked at her with suffering:
dunya looked at her brother with distrustful astonishment
yet it is impossible to reach the rich levels of these and other works without bearing in mind the seriousness for turgenev of his injunction that the artist's task is  understanding in imagery and the representation of what exists, and not theories about the future, not sermons, not propaganda
what a terrible, shocking speech, is not it?
now i remember, said raskolnikov, after some minutes of sullen reflection
and you, my friend, have you come to?
but why should i care about her?
do not worry, i will be careful
perhaps that’s all right; it’s the role of a sick man
dunya blushed fully, then suddenly became anxious:
clearly, they were eager to provoke the two of them
the rain still hadn’t ended
shouted the little boy from the chair
i can’t bear listening to it rustle
where’s the raising of lazarus?† find it for me, sonya
may , completely gray, stout, and somewhat stooped; he's waiting for his son, who just received his candidate's degree, as he himself had some time before
wer für die besten seiner zeit gelebt— der hat gelebt für alle zeiten
he even wondered whether he might be mistaken
what do you think?
the same set of values forms the background at the bazarovs's: when arkady and evgeny talk on the haystack about ultimate questions, they are interrupted by bazarov's father, who more than anyone (except, perhaps his wife) represents a devotion to home, to family, and to immediate neighbors, especially the peasants, whom he treats as part of his family
i do not understand you
one vision flashed before him along the way, but he was not surprised by it; he’d had a premonition that all this must be so
all of this occurred last evening
like speransky,  he added, pursing his lips after a brief silence
to beg for her tears once again?
she greeted svidrigaylov silently and politely, glanced at his soaking wet clothes with astonishment, but didn’t say a word
a man must be fierce, says a splendid spanish proverb
they spit in my face quite openly!
and, in the third place, because i proposed to observe all possible fairness in the execution, weights and measures, and arithmetic: out of all the lice on earth, i picked the least useful and, after killing her, proposed to take from her exactly as much as i needed for the first step, no more, no less (and the remainder, it goes without saying, would go to a monastery, according to the terms of her will—ha, ha!)
good heavens, save her!
moreover, that feeling in me has never been a secret to you
i’ve eaten a little and don’t want any more
not on your life!
he taught us to read and taught me grammar and religion, she added with dignity
nikolai petrovich seemed much more excited than his son; he seemed to have become a little flustered, grown timid as it were
vasily ivanovich's eyes suddenly opened wide, his cheeks flushed slightly
just stand there in front of her?
what did you say?
no one much liked raskolnikov; everyone shunned him
i’ll be absolutely frank with dmitry prokofich, right, dunya?
the same contrast between ideological argument in the foreground and a third set of values in the background quietly opposed to both camps is also written into the scenes at odintsova's
both women were waiting, this time completely convinced by razumikhin’s promise; in fact, he had really managed to bring zosimov
it was odd: as soon as he tried to select a key to the dresser, as soon as he heard the jingling, a shudder seemed to pass through him
what am i guilty of before them?
he was about to throw himself onto his knees to pray, but then he started laughing, not at the idea of prayer, but at himself
though how could he possibly have known what sort of rooms they really were?
be careful, you’ll start drinking!
odintseva watches this window as she will later watch her own face in the mirror—
she sat down next to raskolnikov, to whom she bowed hurriedly, and in passing cast an inquisitive glance at him
come to your senses!
it is this uniquely chekhovian combination which makes him too complex for some reductionist critics (in the east and the west alike), who perpetuate the futile controversy about whether chekhov's view of reality and mankind is positive-optimistic or negative-pessimistic
thus bazarov, everywhere and in everything, does only what he wishes or what seems to him to be advantageous or convenient
by the way, is your father still tax farming?
but she’s very smart, sir
in any attempt to assess turgenev's attitude to revolution and the ideals of his own generation, it is impossible to overlook his relations with herzen
everything was silent, only the cocks crowed boisterously in the village, arousing in any listeners a strange sensation of drowsiness and ennui; somewhere high above the treetops could be heard the unceasing plaintive screech of a fledgling hawk
i know you are used to luxury and pleasure, but even great men of the world are not averse to spending a little time beneath a cottage roof
you won’t leave me, will you, sonya?
bazarov and his fellow nihilists are merely preachers: they denounce phrases, rhetoric, inflated language—bazarov tells arkady not to talk so 'beautifully'—but only in order to substitute for this their own political propaganda; they offer not hard scientific facts, in which they are not interested, with which, indeed they are not acquainted, but slogans, diatribes, radical cant
the attack from the left inflicted wounds which festered for the rest of his life
do you hear me?
they both stopped and stared at each other for a minute, as if sizing each other up
you die from the heat getting there and die again on the way back
arkady said softly into his pillow, on which a tear had already fallen  suddenly he tossed back his hair and said aloud, why on earth did that idiot sitnikov turn up here?
i was merely defending myself at the time
i’ve become so muddled, he said to razumikhin in a completely different tone of voice, laughing
what, then, in your opinion, does he need?
that’s when i guessed, sonya, he continued with enthusiasm, that power is given only to the one who dares to bend down and pick it up
moreover, turgenev on many occasions in his life dissociated himself from revolution, whether simply by denying that he had any interest in politics or by declaring his liberal, gradualist views
veka, voprosy titeratury, , no
if you’re convinced that one shouldn’t eavesdrop, but that you can crack open the skulls of old ladies with anything at hand for your own enjoyment, then you’d best be off to america as soon as possible!
he was busy preparing their apartment
nastasya blurted out suddenly, turning to raskolnikov
eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity
sitnikov, kirsanov, bazarov grumbled without stopping
i just happened to drop in here
pavel petrovieh returns to the europe where he had once found happiness: in dresden  between two and four, at the most fashionable time for strolling, you can meet a man of about fifty, already completely grey and possibly suffering from gout, but still handsome, elegantly dressed, and with that special air which is given only to a person who has spent a long time amidst the highest strata of society
of science and knowledge?
yes, sir, that’s so, sir; the place of a mother, sir, sonya replied hastily and timidly
hmm, i think there’s also no reason to say
stop it, evgeny, for god's sake!
that was precisely the impression made on raskolnikov by the patron who was sitting alone and who looked like a former civil servant
what's to be done?
she invites him to visit her and asks him to bring bazarov
it was only the protest i wanted, but sofiya semyonovna herself felt that she couldn’t remain here in this apartment house!
i wait and hope—and that’s all!
live like this, raskolnikov said with a bitter smile
do you know whether i’m being followed?
i am going away for a long time; as you will agree, i am no tender creature, but i would prefer not to carry away with me the thought that you will remember me with repugnance
when he realized that he had no other sock, he put it back on again—and started laughing once more
for example, she understood the matter of kissing a woman’s hand perfectly—that is, that a man offends a woman by unequal treatment if he kisses her hand
where was he standing then and how could he see?
what money did you use to buy all this?
turgenev plays here with the boundaries of decorum, in a manner that both points to the seductive beyond, and holds to the compromises of convention
i took a ten-ruble note from the table and gave it to you, on my own behalf, as a contribution for your relative and as the first form of assistance
his heart began pounding  did he imagine at that moment the inevitable strangeness of future relations between him and his son?
the child who was asleep on the floor woke up and began crying
both young men left the room
let's not talk about it any more, anna sergeevna
after a moment he added:
don’t pay me any attention
we didn’t talk about it, first because it might happen later of its own accord; probably, he himself, without unnecessary words, will propose it (as if he could refuse this to dunya), all the more so since you yourself might become his right-hand man in the office and then you would receive this assistance not in the form of charity, but as earned income
there is no doubt of the negative service they perform
the social and topical, too, which forms the surface attention of his major novels, always is rooted in deeper psychological, psychohistorical, and philosophical concerns
are you talking about prison, sonya?
you said that so well
what could they prove definitively, even if they arrested him?
if you have something to say, then take a seat; you and nastasya are crowding each other there
ah, you, good lord!
then he grabbed the bolt and quietly, inaudibly slid it into place
i wrote you so much about her
i’m deciding this simply on the basis of my vileness and ineptitude, and perhaps the idea of advantage to myself, as that
cold and damp penetrated his whole body, and he began to shiver
katerina ivanovna herself, with her own hands, performed this nighttime chore at least twice a week, and sometimes more frequently, because things had reached the point that they had almost no clean clothes to change into
i myself am a shirker, and i’m keeping to that
that’s not good at all, sir
he would have been glad of it!
you’re being summoned to their office
what else is there?
excuse me for disturbing you, pavel petrovich said without looking at her
i remember it well
do whatever you think is best
his eyes were closed
what did you say?
that you told me about yourself?
that is, it's time for bed!
the narrator admires prosaic activities as if such happiness were possible only to limited people
at last they discharged him from the hospital
said raskolnikov with a smile
rodya, what are you saying?
to hospital take him!
you still have a little headache, don’t you?
here’s what i’d have done: i’d have taken the money and the items and, as soon as i’d left, immediately, without stopping anywhere, i’d have gone off somewhere to a remote spot where there were only fences, no one around—some garden or something like that
he cried with hatred
she whispered to razumikhin, almost in despair
arkady, on the other hand, considered it his duty, if not to help his father, then at least to display some willingness to help
it’s nonsense, i tell you
when necessary, i’ll come myself or
instead of an answer, he saw the girl’s face draw near his, her full lips innocently ready to kiss him
do you like it better here than in the wing where you were before?
never mind, it's no trouble; i have lots of time
when all three of them, razumikhin, raskolnikov, and sonya, had paused to say a few words on the sidewalk, this person walking by, passing them, suddenly shuddered, accidentally overhearing her words i asked, where does mr raskolnikov live?
we see each other once every five years
i’m so fed up with all this!
he’s made off with my twenty kopecks, raskolnikov muttered spitefully when left alone
she was a young woman, about twenty-three years old, all fair and soft, with dark hair and eyes, full, red, childlike lips, and sweet little hands
he’s a locksmith, a german, he’s rich
the hero and heroine tend to be dull but decent people, while the blocking characters are the truly interesting types
he suddenly felt he was all alone with a beautiful young woman
but enough about that and once again my sincere and warm thanks
in my opinion, that is, according to my personal conviction, that’s exactly the most normal condition of a woman
ah, why did you say that?
everyone gathered in the drawing room
i’m sure that she’s
it was already late in the day when he awoke after a disturbed sleep, but the sleep hadn’t fortified him
the supreme expression of bazarov's love for his parents comes with his ultimate sacrifice for their sake
i know it was stupid!
but this inflamed raskolnikov’s spite even further, and he could scarcely refrain from issuing a sarcastic and somewhat careless challenge
apparently, they were even somewhat afraid of katerina ivanovna; the lodgers, one after another, crowded back to the doorway with that same strange inner feeling of satisfaction that is always present, even in one’s nearest and dearest, when sudden misfortune strikes someone close; it spares no one at all, without exception, no matter how sincere our feelings of pity and sympathy
what the hell are they doing in there?
just as he thought: it was from his mother, in ryazan province
that is, we could start it even today
you see, there’s a belief about you (out there, somewhere) that you might be insane or close to it
i want to focus on death, but nothing comes of it
do you hear how the bolt rattles?
the inception of the novel marks a precise moment in time, a date: may ,
once again you’re bringing disgrace and debauchery to the whole street
it’s hard to talk to you!
kitty has strong feeling for both levin and vronsky, and both feelings might be called love
now, all of a sudden, when her entire heart was turned toward him, he felt and was aware that he had become immeasurably unhappier than before
i’m not even worth that man’s little finger,  he said
would he have been repulsed by the fact that it was too colossal and
yes, repeated bazarov gloomily, you are still a fool
porfiry petrovich was dressed informally, in a dressing gown, extremely clean linen, and well-worn slippers
she was sitting there all alone, in deep thought, and seemed to have been waiting for him a long time
both friends lay there for a while in silence
rodion romanovich, allow her to sit next to you
what will i do there?
no mushrooms or cucumbers, of course, and he shouldn’t have any beef, and
raskolnikov recoiled all the way to the back of the sofa, away from porfiry, who was leaning over him, and he stared directly at him in silent perplexity
no, present your facts!
there’s no need even to speak about ordinary people
isn’t this a sin?
yet for the last month i’ve been
he cried out once again, like a lost soul
recalling this period later, after a very long time, he surmised that his awareness had seemed to grow dim, and that this state continued, with certain interruptions, right up to the definitive catastrophe
almost the same thing was happening now with sonya: just as weakly, with the same fright, she looked at him for a while, and all of a sudden, stretching out her left hand, she gently pushed her fingers against his chest and slowly began standing up from the bed, moving farther and farther away from him, fixing her intense stare on him all the while
thank god, the doctor!
the dying man hardly understood anything; he could only utter disjointed and inarticulate sounds
the figure of bazarov suffered several transformations in successive drafts, up and down the moral scale as this or that friend or consultant reported his impressions
she herself doesn’t realize that it’s impossible to find justice among people, and she gets irritated
the young man uttered not one word in reply
that way sofiya semyonovna can rest easy
he walked along the embankment of the canal, and didn’t have much farther to go
you only pretend to condemn him; in reality you ingratiate yourself with him, and await a single careless smile of his as a favor!
(this profession of incomprehension will be odintseva's later defense as well, masking her attraction to bazarov and her flirtation with him)
here he is, prokofich, began nikolai petrovich
do you have such a high opinion of the germans?
but you just said something about odintsova  that's what you called her, right?
a hideous, lost smile took shape on his lips
what a word can mean!
and the good little peasants are taking your father for all he's worth
a riotous song bursts forth, tambourines jingle, and whistles sound in the chorus
so this is where you have got to!
you were registered there
it is, of course, the narrator—and not bazarov—who has seen odintseva naked; turgenev reallots the mythic roles, and makes his actaeon a willful—not innocent—transgressor
he pushed the newspapers away and turned to face zametov
as  note in my monograph, what shklovsky and fischler have in mind, i think, is aristotle's concept of comedy
she seemed to raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for marmeladov
katerina ivanovna made a point of intentionally inviting this lady and her daughter, whose shoelaces she was unfit to tie, all the more so since up to then in any incidental meeting, the lady would haughtily turn her face away—so that this lady would know that here respectable people have thoughts and feelings, and invite others without holding a grudge, and so that she would see that katerina ivanovna was not used to living in such circumstances
he’s an unstable young fellow, nothing more; he might have seemed promising
maybe i should get drunk, too?
he said, shaking his head again, feeling embarrassed, compassionate, and indignant
that is, not exactly about tubercles
raskolnikov was silent, staring at the floor, thinking about something
it seems so to me, sir
let’s go, mama, said avdotya romanovna
just as i thought!
he was ashamed of the fact that he, raskolnikov, had come to grief so blindly, hopelessly, obscurely, and stupidly, by some decree of blind fate, and that he had to humble himself and submit to the nonsense of such a decree if he ever wanted to set his mind at rest
and he didn’t even tell me!
but you don’t even hide it!
did you hear anything, some noise or anything else?
but it all ended in catastrophe, which you already know, and you yourself can judge what a pitch of rage i reached when i learned that marfa petrovna had found that vile official luzhin and practically arranged a marriage—one that, in fact, was just like the one i was offering
the hair was cut short and worn straight, and the wearer frequently assumed dark glasses
gradually the previous image of dunechka began to appear before him; all of a sudden a tremor passed through his whole body
listen to me, and listen carefully: the caretaker, kokh, pestryakov, another gentleman, the caretaker’s wife, and the woman who was sitting with her in the lodge at the time, and the court councillor kryukov, who, at that very moment, got out of a cab and entered through the gateway, arm in arm with a woman—everyone, that is eight or ten witnesses, unanimously testify that nikolai had pushed dmitry down on the ground and was lying on top of him, punching him, while he had grabbed hold of nikolai’s hair and was also punching him
the coffin will be a simple one, sir
and can’t even manage such a small expenditure
now he’s turned toward progressive politics; he hasn’t a clue about it, but i encourage him, of course
his broad face, with prominent cheekbones, was rather pleasant; his complexion was fresh, not typical of petersburg
these powerful, all-knowing circles, which despised and attacked everyone, had for a long time inspired petr petrovich with a particular kind of fear, one that was, however, completely undefined
yes  and in general
she repeated, beside herself
well, sir, i may be a swine, but she is a lady!
only one ruble and fifteen kopecks now?
but anna  et voilà tout: and that's all (french)
all at once he recalled it all in one moment
i do, raskolnikov replied firmly; while saying this he stared down at the ground, as he had done during the entire course of his long tirade, having selected a spot on the rug
his face, extremely fresh and even ruddy, seemed younger than his forty-five years, even without his new clothes
i only wish, before signing off, to say a few words to my young contemporaries, my colleagues who embark on the slippery field of literature
why did i come here?
it's a bitter pill—but one must swallow it
realizing this and not paying any more attention, she went to the hall door to close it; then, catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold, she suddenly screamed
even his hair, with only a slight trace of gray, had been combed and curled by a barber, but this fact didn’t make him look comical or foolish, as usually happens with curled hair, because it inevitably conveys to the face the look of a german about to get married
he finished ’er off!
i think he's coming, peter whispered all of a sudden
i owe him my regeneration
so you deny knowledge of the other hundred rubles?
they were now standing in front of the last staircase, next to the landlady’s door, and in fact there was light coming from underneath the door to raskolnikov’s little room
'how do i know?
dunyasha ran back and forth like a madwoman and kept slamming doors; meanwhile peter, even at three o'clock in the morning, was still trying to strum a cossack waltz on the guitar
i ran away from them to rent an apartment so they wouldn’t be able to find me; i grabbed a pile of money to take with me
it's probably all the same to you, but you should know that not only would not i trade you for your sister, i would not trade you for anyone else in the world
it’s in the fourth gospel, she whispered sternly, not approaching him
up to a certain point
is bazarov a forerunner of the politically committed, militant soviet intellectual, or a malicious caricature of the fathers of russian communism?
i have just seen him; it's his custom, as you probably know, to get up very early and explore the area
everything about sonya seemed somehow stranger and more astounding with each passing minute
but all of this constant anxiety and mental anguish couldn’t pass without consequences
i didn’t even think about it at the time, i simply didn’t want to
do people out in this province of ours still believe in rademacher?
all along i have been thinking about what i want to say to you  brother, fulfill your obligation, the obligation of an honest, generous man; end temptation and the bad example you are setting, you, the best of men
with princess r  especially the upper part of her face
she supported her round face on her small closed fist
and bazarov is consigned to the infinite future of life after death, as suggested by the flowers growing on his grave, which, the narrator concludes, speak of eternal reconciliation and life everlasting (:  [p ])
yes, i clearly remember him; i could pick him out of a thousand
what didn’t he say yesterday, good lord!
you take mine, you give up yours, without regrets, without turning back
well, then, on the contrary!
avdotya romanovna noticed it
she had her own capital
the danger of groveling before the people at one moment, distorting them the next, then crediting them with sacred and high convictions, and then branding them unfortunate and insane
the singer’s thin voice warbled
fenechka, who was trying to decipher in a low voice the article on creosote
even though i was standing far away, i saw everything, everything, and even though from the window it was hard to make out a banknote—you’re right about that—by a special circumstance i know for certain that it was indeed a hundred-ruble banknote, because when you were just about to give sofiya semyonovna a ten-ruble note—i myself saw it—at the same time you took from the table a hundred-ruble note
all the same, i won’t look at it through your eyes: if i had succeeded, i’d have been crowned, but now i’ve fallen into a trap!
careers forged through one's own work are always more secure and broader than a career built with low bows or the intercession of an important uncle
he continued, almost aloud
this last word uttered in english went almost unnoticed, but everyone was touched
well, of course, you’re right
in brief, in spite of the kind and generous treatment by marfa petrovna, mr svidrigaylov’s wife, and all the servants, dunechka had a very difficult time, especially when mr svidrigaylov, following old regimental custom, was under the influence of bacchus
my business is inconsequential, but god knows what people might think
i keep posing that question to myself, sonya
so, you still believe in the new jerusalem?
help me get into the droshky and do not give way to melancholy
i believe mejerchol would was absolutely right in perceiving that bazarov is more poet than scientist, a position i wish to extend in this paper, in the hope that it not only will provide yet another interpretation of fathers and sons, but will in some small measure add to the growing body of work that seeks to offset the currently reigning clichés about turgenev's status as a writer in the distinctively russian literary tradition
ordinary individuals are condemned to disappear in the whole, to be swallowed up in its stream; but they augmented its force, broadened and deepened its course—what more could they want?
they had both been brought in from the street
that’s an old woman’s selfishness
what good would it do you?
in addition, your family has now come to see you; you should think about them
bazarov repeats, not at all having expected such events
finally he reached a narrow street; half dead, he turned into it; here he was somewhat safe and understood this: there would be less suspicion, a crowd of people scurrying about, and he would blend into it like a grain of sand
due to your idleness and depravity, raskolnikov interrupted
there are not any general principles— you have not even figured that out yet—there are only sensations
bazarov now gives way to impotent fury, vindictiveness, malice:
it was an effective picture!
nevertheless, you’ll simply drive yourself mad like that, so help me god, sir!
() matvei ilyich's suavity of demeanour was equalled only by his stately manner
call the police, and i’ll swear an oath!
treat bazarovism however you please—that is your business; but you will not be able to put a stop to it; it is just the same as cholera
weekly discourses ceased publication, which is why it wasn’t published there
and it seems even more likely that dostoevsky, author of the magnificent birth scene in the possessed and of the unforgettable burial scene in the brothers karamazov (bratia kara-mazovy), understood turgenev's affirmation of the reconciliation and continuity of generations, his affirmation of young life at play as that which makes bearable the inevitability of the grave
you’ll end up like that!
i’ll repay you with my life, i will!
for a minute they stared at each other in silence
where had these feelings come from?
why did i get so smashed?
i saw it as i came past
perhaps you find them ridiculous?
bazarov and his friends will discover nothing; they are not researchers; they are mere ranters, men who declaim in the name of a science which they do not trouble to master; in the end they are no better than the ignorant, benighted russian priesthood from whose ranks they mostly spring, and far more dangerous
that’s what i said
we don’t have any provinces where i come from, your excellency, but districts
porfiry left, slouching a little and trying to avoid looking at raskolnikov
he bent over, grabbed the top of the block powerfully with both hands, gathered all his strength, and turned it over
i wanted to forget everything and start all over again, sonya, and to stop chattering!
in spite of these strange words, he felt very wretched
i might indirectly serve the cause of their development and our propaganda
in truth, it’s ridiculous that i’ve set out to see razumikhin
and what will we do?
i know the story—how and why it was conceived
there was no reason to ring in vain, and it wasn’t in his nature
and in schools, too?
i can’t express it to you; here—you’re good at math, and i know you’re still studying now
i have not seen him or my mother for a long time; one must console the old folks
let’s get down to business
he is fully capable of treating bazarov as an intellectual equal, but he writes from a position as far above arkady and katya as, let us say, balzac's narrator is above eugenie grandet
feeling cold and barely conscious, he opened the door to the office
his difficulties with the farm increased with every passing day—cheerless, senseless difficulties
she brought her crushed fingers to her lips, blew on them, and then, suddenly, stood up abruptly from her chair and headed to the door with rapid steps, as if wishing to call bazarov back  the maid came into the room carrying a pitcher on a silver tray
sonya looked at him attentively
you should have treated her differently
as for that money
we all came here together, since we couldn’t let her come alone
i myself know of one work that will definitely suit
their conversation ended here
fortunately, there was an easy topic for conversation, and he seized upon it quickly
the doctor, the same country doctor who lacked the caustic, arrived and after examining the patient, advised them to continue waiting it out and then added a few words about the possibility of recovery
the fat lieutenant colonel (in reality, a retired second lieutenant) also didn’t attend, but it turned out that he had been dead tired since yesterday morning
he grabbed his cap and headed for the door
you don’t know it—but that’s what they thought!
that would be even better
it would be interesting to know what people fear the most
is he still so timid in your presence?
here chekhov only echoes turgenev's potugin (smoke, ), who, despite his mordant skepticism, is confident that what happened with the russian language (its capacity to absorb the violent impact of alien forms) will take place also in other spheres
what on earth for?
some sort of carriage stood amidst the throng
replying to them, he spoke for three-quarters of an hour, constantly interrupted and cross-examined
she did not know whether he was joking or not
might it be possible somehow to sidestep any questions about my sister and not mention her name?
from time to time he stumbled upon signs for little shops and greengrocers, and he read each one carefully
there was no argument: raskolnikov had already managed to compromise himself too much, but no facts had yet been established
i loved my wife for one whole year,
any indecision, you mean
then sitnikov jumped into his carriage and, after bellowing at two passing peasants, put on your caps, you idiots!
i was very frivolous
bazarov wound up losing a sum of money that, though insignificant, was still not altogether pleasant for him
to a f onegin
their words are all so ordinary, but there’s something to them
lyonya didn’t have a costume; she wore only the late semyon zakharych’s red knitted worsted cap (or, rather, nightcap), into which a broken piece of white ostrich feather had been inserted: it had belonged to katerina ivanovna’s grandmother and had been kept in a trunk up to now as a family treasure
it’s just that, rodion romanovich, old boy, i know about your other exploits, too; i know everything, sir!
i ask you to finish, said raskolnikov
much better if we go and look at a beetle
he had reached this decision a while ago, when he awoke
he muttered, standing aimlessly in the entrance, directly opposite the door to the caretaker’s small dark lodgings, also left open
rodion romanovich, old boy!
arkady asked in turn
by morning, in the low-lying parts of town, water will pour onto the streets, flooding basements and cellars; the sewer rats will emerge, and amidst the rain and wind, people, soaking wet and cursing, will begin hauling their stuff up to the higher floors
the shovel slid from his hands
you keep interrupting me, and we
good lord, could it have been that money
he returns to this in one of his late poems in prose: 'honest souls turned away from him
when, shuddering, he once again lifted his head and glanced around, he immediately forgot what he’d been thinking about and even where he’d been going
he didn’t even say good-bye to her; he had already forgotten her; one scathing and rebellious doubt flared up in his soul
his feeling toward pavel petrovich is not exactly amicable; he is annoyed by the element of haughtiness in him, but he involuntarily tries to conceal his irritation under the guise of disdainful indifference
too much alike in us
unexpectedly seeing a room full of people, she wasn’t merely embarrassed, but overwhelmed; she felt timid as a child and even made a move to leave
friday, your exc-c-c-c-cellency, the day of the week
how can i tell rodya not to come?
the closer they got to his house, the more and more the drunken man was overcome by embarrassment and fear
you’re right, she doesn’t like me; but you mustn’t vouch for what happens between a husband and his wife, or between a man and his mistress
among other things, he said that the governor, bourdaloue,  had issued a special order to all his subordinates to wear spurs, just in case he should have to dispatch them on horseback in a great hurry
he hesitated a moment and then went on in french
in that case, it would not be a bad idea to have a little snooze, arkady observed
while saying this, svidrigaylov himself was extremely calm and cool
it’s not that i can’t stand him, but he was the cause of my quarrel with marfa petrovna, when i found out that she had concocted this wedding
(but i’m drinking a great deal of wine and prattling on)
and do you hold the same negative attitude concerning other conventions accepted in human society?
do you understand, do you really understand what that cleanliness entails?
the reasons for the cooling of interest in pushkin in russia during the mid-nineteenth century, turgenev observed in his pushkin speech in , lay in the historical development of society, in the conditions giving shape to the new life
you must still be very ill you shouldn’t have gone out
well, give me the shirt; where are the stockings?
well, sir, i, her own father, took those thirty kopecks to ease my hangover!
only irrefutable facts, only useful knowledge, matter
we’ve been pleased to make do with other people’s ideas—and we’ve gotten used to it!
he no longer argued with pavel petrovich, all the more so because the latter assumed an excessively aristocratic demeanor in his presence and expressed his opinions more with sounds than words
but as soon as he’d touched the clothes, a gold watch slipped out from under the fur coat
here he alludes to the very same saying—happy people have no history— that appears in the notebooks for anna karenina and resulted in the most famous first sentence of any novel: all happy families resemble each other; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
therefore, luzhin must possess good qualities
but now, for some reason, he was suddenly drawn to people
when arkady courts her, nature is one of the most important elements in their growing relationship
just think, it seems that horrible man was the cause of her death
[fathers and sons, ch ]
turgenev thus frames his narrative with diametrically opposed conceptions of time, one concrete and limited, the other highly abstract and limitless
what if petr petrovich refuses?
why should you listen to me?
noticing that fifi had made a few hesitant steps in her direction, she cried, shoo, shoo!
a tall watchtower caught his eye on the left
there was a smile on his lips, and some sort of new, irritated impatience shone through his smile
i don’t understand such expressions when used to describe human activity
you yourself wanted me to go; now i’ll be sitting in prison and your wish will be fulfilled; why are you crying?
but nikolai’s confession was a genuine fact
what a splendid woman anna sergeevna is, exclaimed arkady, when left alone later with his companion in the room reserved for them
my sister worked as a governess in his house
we’ve tormented her enough!
however, on that score, all was well for the time being; after seeing his pale, dignified face, which had grown fuller of late, petr petrovich even felt consoled for a moment in the full conviction that he could find another bride somewhere else, and she might even be a better one; but he immediately came to his senses and spat vigorously to one side, which caused his young friend and roommate, andrey semyonovich lebezyatnikov to smile sarcastically
yes, and they continue to slip out
but this bloodletting may even be good for me
what did you see, sir?
here’s your letter, she began, placing it on the table
who would testify against himself?
the family, then, the family as it exists among our peasants!
they both left quietly and closed the door
she was trying to say that he walked around with his hands in his pockets, but it came out that he picked other people’s pockets
sonya paused at the threshold, but didn’t cross it and looked like a lost soul
i won’t go to see them now
the secretary in one of our embassies was murdered for some enigmatic financial dealings
just now i went into a shop and left a young girl to watch over her—and here’s what happened!
as soon as he gets married, i will go somewhere far away, to dresden or florence and live there until i pass on
marmeladov, before entering the room, sank to his knees in the doorway, while he pushed raskolnikov forward
i’m not that foolish
and therefore thank you again
odintseva's house, like her life, is a model of absolute order, established by the dead husband whose spirit still presides
i hoped to get some cash!
razumikhin will find me
sit down, you must be tired!
he knew that change could only be achieved by pressure
but allow me, nikolai petrovich began
who are you looking for?
the old man interrupted
before him was an extremely young face, about sixteen, perhaps even only fifteen—a little face, under fair hair, pretty, but quite flushed and seemingly swollen
everything’s out of sight—the purse, too!
sonya hastened to restrain katerina ivanovna; but when amaliya ivanovna suddenly yelled something about a yellow ticket, katerina ivanovna pushed sonya away and went after amaliya ivanovna to carry out her threat about the cap immediately
all right; speak, but quickly!
he kept pacing the room in silence, without glancing at her
do stay  it's nice talking to you  like walking along the edge of an abyss
you know, do not you, the elegant side of life is inaccessible to me, that side you value so highly
go away; leave us altogether!
throughout the novel the high-mindedness, dedication, and energy that make bazarov tower over the other characters are occasionally expressed with an immaturity bordering on adolescent revolt
we belong to different generations, and is now resigned to his turn having come to swallow the pill
arina vlasevna had had time to dress up; she would put on a tall cap with silk ribbons and a light blue patterned shawl
raskolnikov continued down the stairs
well, we’ll see how it turns out there
but justice forces me to put forward the proposition that the author of fathers and sons acted thus not without an insidious intention
he knew that anna sergeevna was alone with bazarov, but felt none of his previous jealousy; on the contrary, his face was brightening slowly; he seemed to be surprised at something, delighted by it, and had made up his mind about it
is what you wrote really possible?
all this is so ordinary, it’s all relative, all purely form
this morning dunya had received some sort of letter!
he’d stood up at the guests’ arrival and was standing there waiting, his mouth wide open in a smile, but regarding the whole scene in bewilderment and even disbelief; he looked at raskolnikov with some confusion
i didn’t believe, yet just now i was embracing and kissing my mother; i am not a believer, yet i asked her to pray for me
did porfiry wink at me just now or not?
everything around him had grown dark and quiet, and fenechka's face appeared before him, so small and pale
directly to the right of the gate stretched the long, blank unwhitewashed wall of the adjacent four-story building
do you have such a high opinion of yourself?
raskolnikov said suddenly, with an expression of the most impatient annoyance
thank goodness the details aren’t necessary, as much as the heart of the matter; but if, if only he was capable, if svidrigaylov was devising some intrigue against dunya, then
taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door
only pray for me
this cleanliness costs money
victor, you know i am angry with you
learning is not only light, according to the russian proverb—it is freedom as well
objects shifted and swirled, like a whirlwind
bazarov agreed, saying he really needed to prepare himself in advance for a career as a country doctor
what did he say?
was he aware that his son might have shown him more respect if he would never mentioned the subject?
i’d be afraid to be in your room at night, he observed glumly
there are no such roles in a commune
that's all romanticism, nonsense, rot, and artsy nonsense [chudozestvo]
all that day we pondered and considered it together
as for bazarov, he does not aspire to become a provincial bigwig: if his imagination sometimes pictures the future, then this future is somehow indefinitely broad; he works without a goal, in order to earn his crust of bread or from love of the process of work, but, nevertheless, he vaguely feels that given the caliber of his mind his work will not pass without a trace and will lead to something
with everyone in the house]
other thoughts flooded his mind
it’s so terribly stuffy in his room
that cuckoo is to blame for everything
no, dear brother, we have spent enough time putting on airs and worrying about what other people think: we have already become old and tranquil folk; it's time for us to put aside all vanity
as a result of her small size, the blow came down on the crown of her head
similarly, it has been pavel's unspoken antipathy toward the idea of his brother's marrying a peasant girl that has caused nikolai to wait so long before regularizing his liaison with fenechka
and yet their life, the human element in their feelings is not insignificant
these lectures produced a sensation among not only the students, but all petersburg
he, too, had probably seen her from a distance and was trying to catch up with her, but raskolnikov had hindered him
sitnikov once again emitted a shrill laugh
what use is it?
perhaps the mistress is german?
as you know, the whole affair turned out to be nothing
and in this atom, in this mathematical dot, the blood circulates, the brain works, there's even a desire for something
consequently, those winters in petersburg when he would spent endless days studying the latest works had all been in vain; in vain had he listened in on those young people's conversations; in vain had he rejoiced when he managed to insert a word or two into their heated discussions
i don’t understand a thing!
she very much wanted to find out what he was talking about with the landlady because she was completely enamored with razumikhin
the passage immediately following this one is the paraphrase of bazarov's contempt for the madness of
namely, when the editors of the contemporary started to assure its subscribers in print that they had dispensed with me for my wretched convictions (while in fact i would not publish there— despite their pleas—for which i have documentary proof), i could not keep up my character, and publicly proclaimed what was involved, and of course, suffered a complete fiasco!
but most likely you won’t blame me for my unintended silence
he stopped taking walks alone and began seeking company; he took tea in the living room, wandered around the garden with vasily ivanovich, and smoked his pipe with him in peace and quiet; he even inquired once about father aleksei

i was out in the rain yesterday, mama
do you know the details?
but there was no bride, nothing ever happened—it was all a mirage!
bazarov attempts to locate himself existentially in the space/time continuum and manages to perceive his own insignificance compared not only to his parents', but to the infinity of space and the eternity of time
it would be better to swear on your father's moneybags
think what could be more terrible than not loving and not being loved!
the old woman’s scribbles on the items, let’s say, so on and so forth—all that’s rubbish, sir
porfiry waited impatiently for raskolnikov to leave
in any case, i have been punished enough
nikolai petrovich also stood up
fathers and sons (and daughters)
a minute later, he was already on the street
the devil only knows
cried sonya almost in despair, and she clutched her head
a living, whole man is caught by the author in each of bazarov's actions and movements
it was strange: he suddenly seemed completely calm; there was none of his half-crazed delirium as before, none of the overwhelming fear he’d experienced previously
well, all right, all right!
replied raskolnikov apathetically and walked out ahead, descending the stairs slowly
the techniques employed by the nihilists did not in themselves imply a politico-revolutionary view of life
after hesitating a little, he climbed the last stairs and entered the apartment
but for katkov's persistent demands fathers and sons would never have appeared
it was very stupid
nevertheless, bjoring, who knew the truth, was frightened

the theologian said nothing; he looked around, then put his pipe back in his mouth, and they all went on their way

but understand, anna, understand  he said in a low voice, hurrying

prince andrei, despite the quick driving and the sleepless night, felt himself still more animated than the day before as he pulled up to the palace

if what we have heard is true, it's terrible
were the sounds somehow peculiar, significant?
and here is lukyan timofeich … the prince wants to sleep, lukyan timofeich; about-face!
liberalism is not a sin; it is a necessary part of the whole, which without it would fall apart or atrophy; liberalism has the same right to exist as the most well-mannered conservatism; what i am attacking is russian liberalism, and i repeat again that i attack it essentially because a russian liberal is not a russian liberal, but is a non-russian liberal
soon a woman in a red cap stuck herself out the door holding a hot pot of dumplings with both hands, and placed it in the midst of those ready to eat

he was about to embrace her, but she retreated, blushing, so as not to have her dress rumpled
he asked with a start, as if something cold had touched him, and he opened his eyes
what are you trying to say?
he was in hunting dress, still all dusty, wearing high boots and holding a crop in his hand
some of our liberals, still not long ago, took this hatred of russia for all but a genuine love of the fatherland and boasted of seeing better than others what it should consist of; but by now they’ve become more candid, and have even begun to be ashamed of the words love of the fatherland,  have even banished and removed the very notion as harmful and worthless
what's that to me?

when he went outside, akaky akakievich was as if in a dream
love only added fuel to the fire
at least everybody complains that there are none
and to tell the truth, for the majority of our young ladies, it did not matter whom they married, as long as they got married
he went out to the garden
he asked, showing d'artagnan a place where it had been pierced through

sofya semyonovna is not at home
however, the reason i maintain that, the prince suddenly picked up, obviously wishing to correct himself, is because people back then (i swear to you, it has always struck me) were not at all the same sort of people as we are now, not the same breed as now, in our time, really, like a different species … at that time people were somehow of one idea, while now they’re more nervous, more developed, sensitive, somehow of two or three ideas at once … today’s man is broader—and, i swear, that’s what keeps him from being such a monolithic man as in those times … i … i said it solely with that in mind, and not …

you, too, if you please, young man

the other day at the apraksins' i heard a lady ask: 'c'est ça le fameux prince andré?

in response to lauriston's proposal of peace, he replied that there could be no peace, because such was the will of the people; he alone, during the french retreat, said that all our maneuvers are unnecessary, that everything was getting done by itself, better than we could wish, that the enemy should be given a golden bridge, that the battles of tarutino, vyazma, and krasnoe were unnecessary, that they had to have some men left when they got to the border, that he would not give up one russian even for ten frenchmen

but he wants, then, to draw down on that head the punishment reserved for the damned!
natasha sat down with sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting prince andrei to join her
she's walking through the church with her eyes closed, constantly spreading her arms as if wishing to catch someone

iii: the audience well, then, captain, said porthos, beside himself, the truth is that we were six against six, but we were set upon treacherously, and before we had time to draw our swords, two of us had fallen dead, and athos, grievously wounded, was hardly worth more

the impression princess marya made on rostov was very pleasant
this morning the spanish deputies came to me, and i got into the carriage together with them

it was mutually and amicably agreed between totsky and the general that for the time being they would avoid any formal and irrevocable steps
it made for such losses!
i wo not describe the rest of that night, the fuss, and then the official visits; till dawn i literally shivered and considered it my duty not to go to bed, though, anyhow, i did not do anything
